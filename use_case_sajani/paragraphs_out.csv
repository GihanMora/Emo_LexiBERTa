Further to that, where people make the argument that the board – you know potentially if an argument is that the demographic for our product or service is not particularly diverse, we don't really need a diverse board for that reason, then my argument would always be well this is what your business does now and this is who your business serves now, but you always need to be evolving as an organisation and perhaps having a different point of view around the table will help you see where that next opportunity is or the risk to your business that you can't comprehend.

Women are very busy to take that on. I remember onetimeI was trying to employ a new scheduler or something and there were two applied and it was within the company and it was a guy and a girl. I remember thinking at the time, both of them were quite capable; the girl probably would actually be more capable but she needed a bit more training and I had no time to train; and I go, “I’ve got no time, I’m going to have to select him because he’s done half the job anyway,” and you can hit the ground running, even though I knew it would be great but I’ve got no spare capacity.

But I said, “Well I’m not going to do a single scholarship.” I’m not having some poor woman there just by herself. I’m only going to put the scholarship up if I can get three women; that they can actually, once you’re there, you can actually then learn from each other and have a voice. And so, I think that’s very important in women. If you just put a token of women in there, theydon’t have a voice and you only then attracting women who want to act and behave like everyone else, so what’s the point. And I think one of the books that really informed me was of that Amanda Sinclair’s one: Doing Leadership Differently. And I thought about that quite heavily when I was at Melbourne University.

So, it’s a change of the model but it means there is no downtime really; whereas I suppose in a client-side you produce something over a year, and you might stop, and you celebrate and you make money for the goods. We’re a labour hire company so you only make money when the people are working. So, you don’t stop for an hour for lunch. You make 10% on the whole time.

One of the things at the end of that period is that there’s a feeling like, I’m not sure if I still have the skills. I’m not sure if I still have the social connections. There’s a barrier to overcome, to choosing at that moment to re-enter an organisation.

His name got written down to consider. He didn’t get it, because his communication skills weren’t – they were about a year off being what was required.

And I suppose I’m along the lines of selling performance, holistic strategy, how do you get through the next 10 years when everything is changing. And what’s the best behavioural aspects. So one of the best behavioural aspects of getting through the next 10 years, for example, is to make lots of small bets. You go, I’ll have 10 options, six of those options won’t work, but four will. We’re not in the environment anymore where you have a business model that will last for 20 years. But behaviourally that is a different type of person. That’s not someone who’s been an accountant – that’s not the person who’s been at a law firm for 30 years. That’s someone who’s a little be entrepreneurial for example. Or has tried and failed.

And you get that. And I know this from not personal experience but closely related personal experience. They don’t kind of want their position shoved in their face by having another father or mother figure. They want friends and people that walk – and the people that would understand that best is the people that have walked the path. So I think that would be very good. But you have to have walked the path and then still be competent enough to contribute. You can’t be an angry young man in a board that requires competence and requires you to look at financials. So in a way you need that special breed of person that’s like the Eddie McGuire kind of person or this Somali guy. I don’t know how you find them. I think they’re gems when you do.

It’s more important that diversity. You do have to have a – so diversity is important but cohesion is something that you really want. And that’s what the chair has to bring out. And if you had to choose between the two, cohesion is really important. And I use an example of a board member that the chair got rid of, because he was exactly – super competent in some areas. But just wasn’t cohesive. And at the end of the day, it’s a very hard structure to just keep together. It’s like these atoms that they don’t want to fall apart, but you’re just there for four hours every month. You want to get the value you can. You can’t waste time arguing points that – so yeah, cohesion is really important.

Five is an execute that’s serviced at an elite level in one area. You want that. And then one is you’ve got a working knowledge. You’re not at zero, it’s just you have no understandings. You don’t want anyone at zero on anything.So I think Paul’s point is really good because you want ones.

In every group there’ll be someone in favour and there’ll be someone out of favour. Or at least that’s the natural tendency of humans to just – and so I did notice with the – a chair has to control that impulse. That scapegoating impulse. This board would be good except for that member. Or I suppose that’s that cohesion point. But there are things that push cohesion away. And it’s not diversity. It’s kind of a pack mentality. Because in boards you’ll have, out of 12 people you’ll have two or three coalitions. And then you might have one on the outer. And sometimes people want that person on the outer because their performance is, oh, at least I’m better than that guy. And so that’s a very – so I think it’s natural. In the pecking order, people will know if they’re first or second. And they’ll know if they’re last. And so – yeah, you will know that. Not the two boards that I’m on, but I have been on a board where I’ve just been the least competent person there, and you just go okay, well that’s – so I suppose what I’m trying to say is the cohesion is really, really important.

I do like the inward and outward diversity, if you like. Where people will be looking out and they’ll go, that’s the big picture.

And you can’t have 12 people from Melbourne who have travelled to these places for one week. You need some hook-in. I wouldn’t call it diversity, you just need people with those experiences there. One of the best things, for example, that ANZ did was bring in people from Google that has been in America. Because all of a sudden they have that Silicon Valley diversity that is really needed in today’s companies. So that’s a lot of diversity there. And I do really like, I think, both of your points.

2510,1D,1D_28,The participant,"So, look, diversity is really important. And one of the reasons it’s really important, one of the things that happened recently is we had to sack a CEO. And CEOs tread this very fine line between risking enough to get a business going – because they have to be go-getters, and they have to be a type of person that is a go-getter – and to be a conservative person that keeps everything together. And sometimes I’ve seen that that mix doesn’t work. And you do need a board to oversee that. And you do need – when you’re kind of assessing whether a CEO is balancing on that line, whether he’s doing enough risk and he’s doing enough keeping the whole thing together – so you can have problems either way. You can have a CEO that’s not trying hard enough and not risking enough.

Whether they’re making enough bets or whether they’re making the right bets. And obviously the boards main job is to appoint a CEO and make sure that their performance is keeping to track. And then the rest is monitoring and governance, but that’s the really hard job. And I suppose if you’re going to – it’s not trial by jury, but it almost is. If you’re going to have that, you do need more than just one type of person to do that. You need someone that’s – so in the NFP organisation , which is mostly about resources and giving programs to disadvantaged women and girls, you need people that are good on that front, on the social front.

If it’s anything important I will cc – I will courtesy copy both of you. It’s by appointment. It’s by exception. So you do have that relationship with management. But a lot of it does filter through the CEO. And I mean, it’s a hard job, because CEOs have to manage – there’s 12 people on both boards. It’s such a hard job to do. And you don’t want loose ends. As much as possible, you want to give them the capability of managing you to the extent possible. So you do – yeah, I mean, that’s why everything goes through the chair. And the chair’s job does seem to be five times harder than being on a board. And I think a chair’s job, you need 10 years of experience on a board to be a good chair, in my opinion.

We’re just trying to [understand] 00:11:34 some of the issues here. When we talk about diversity and diversity in terms of their competence is assumed as important, but we’re also thinking in terms of gender diversity.

2524,1D,1D_40,The participant,"Yeah. So one of the things I think is missing on boards a little bit in Australia that isn’t missing in America is a performance – so sometimes you have boards that are very not diverse, because they’ll have eighth of the 12 people will be very compliance based. And you’ll get a board that gets stuck in this compliance. And really you want to – I think you want a board to help performance as well. So you have that compliance/performance crossover. So in America you have an expression, you either give money, you get money, or you get out. So in a way that’s a very harsh way of saying American boards are – they will try and help the CEO on the performance side. My experience of what I’ve seen on Australian boards is that we don’t have that compliance/performance thing quite worked out yet. So I don’t think we have diversity in that way.

So you just extend out that skill matrix to more of a diversity lens and look at what you're looking at.  I don't think it's simply just a head count matter.  You might have four females on the board but if they're all shrinking violets, then you might in fact be better with just one who's much more robust in terms of their nature.

So over the past ten years now here in Australia for example the one sector that has consistently attracted large amounts of capital investment as compared to others is the health care sector and that's because there's been tremendous growth with the technology and advances in pathologies or therapeutics and diagnostics and coupled with of course the aging population, people receive better healthcare throughout their life. All of that has come together in a variety of different ways to make healthcare, even aged care sectors that have them high on the radar for private capital investors because of that future outlook and opportunity that is core to what type of capital investment they’re looking for is sectors and businesses that are in that sector that exhibit strong fundamentals of growth and expansion opportunities.

So we, I mean we could spend a lot of time deep diving into policy areas that relate to the sectors that our members invest into which can get a little bit tricky and very time consuming. So what we tend to debate most of our energy to Margot is ensuring that the policy and the regulatory framework that sits within the financial services component of the economy is set up in a way that helps the facilitate greater investment and encourage greater investment. So in other words we want government policies to enable more capital to flow into Australian businesses to help them grow and expand to employ more people. To make a bigger contribution for the economy and so our interest from a policy and advocacy perspective is ensuring that the government of the day, whoever that might be, understands our role as an industry. And then if they put in place policies that support and encourage more investment and in some cases that might be more of a discussion about ensuring that there aren’t policies and regulations that get in the way of investment. So it depends on the context and the situation. We tend to gravitate towards those areas of policy that help to create a bigger pipeline of investing, let’s get more capital in the Australia economy rather than getting too far into the detail of specific sectors and the policy issues that might sit around the healthcare sector. But having said all that, from time to time we do, so there are significant orders of policy where we have worked closely with government in the healthcare sector for example to ensure that there is the right policy architecture in place to support things like the translation and commercialisation of high quality medical research into commercialised products and services in the Australian market then the global market.

That was really where our industry started, yeah in the Australia economy. In markets like the US private equity, private capital has a much longer, much richer history and probably can be traced back forty or fifty years and somebody could say longer than that.

Ultimately they seem to have [unclear] 00:28.36 a genuineness of a buy in to diversity.

So to me it’s very critical that the leadership of a board bring a genuineness to this and if they are unconvinced by the merits of diversity or they see it as a tick the box exercise then there’s probably a separate conversation that should happen about whether or not the right leadership is in place and if there is a gap in knowledge or a gap in understanding the true value of diversity. There are ways to remedy that and I know that in the past probably ten or fifteen years there has been a need for board shares particularly those that have been professional company directors for a long time perhaps, there has been a comprehensive program of work carried out where it’s been an attention to ensure that new knowledge, new insights are brought to the boardroom table around the benefits [unclear] 00:31:37 value, the virtues of diversity because it’s not a conversation that we had twenty or thirty years ago when perhaps those directors first started becoming professional company directors.

And the private capital investor tend to be significant shareholder, in the case of equity investors we do have forms of private capital investment but are more geared towards say debt rather than equity. But I’ll generalise for the moment and talk about equity investment. And so when private capital investors invest they put into business, they tend to become in many cases major shareholder and controlling shareholders of the business. And one of the features of private capital investment that is uniquely different to other forms of equity and debt investment really is that it is a much more active asset management strategy than most other more traditional passive strategies. And what that really means that once the investment is directed into a particular business the private capital investors whether they are private equity firm or a venture firm or private credit fund tend to play a very significant role in guiding, well defining and then guiding execution of strategy for that to work.

I think the better approach is for regulation and policy to help set the right frameworks in place to ensure that [unclear] 00:54:21 that might exist to bringing about great diversity [unclear] 00:54:27. And then in the different ways that policy and regulation can do that, the corporations law for example needs to be sure that it doesn’t, in setting the parameters it can get [unclear] 00:54:45 well skills and attributes of directors and responsibilities of directors from a legal perspective.

I might, but I would think so carefully about what listed board I chose to take on I think because it is a whole new challenge around many things such as disclosure, and I just think – I suspect one day I’ll probably end up on a listed company, but I’m not rushing into it like I thought I might previously.","{'sadness': 0, 'anger': 0, 'fear': 0, 'disgust': 0.011, 'surprise': 0.121, 'joy': 0.132, 'anticipation': 0.261, 'trust': 0.515}","['right,', 'interesting', 'aspired', 'that’s', 'Yeah,']"

4868,28D Chair,28D Chair_43,A,"Oh well you don’t have to disclose, there’s no continuous disclosure obligations if you’re not on a listed board. And so - but of course on listed companies there are, and you have to get that right. And as a board director one of the things that was loud and clear to me was that directors, they’re not there every day, they are heavily reliant on the executive for information and resources and things that enable them to complete their all obligations, not only disclosure. So you are heavily reliant, and if you don’t – you can easily get it wrong if you’re not being supported adequately, and the buck stops with you as the director.","{'anger': 0, 'fear': 0, 'surprise': 0, 'sadness': 0.002, 'anticipation': 0.07, 'disgust': 0.073, 'joy': 0.097, 'trust': 0.797}","['disclose,', 'adequately,', 'clear', 'they’re', 'but']"

And additionally you’ve got shareholders at AGMs that – and you’ve got major shareholders that are increasing their shareholdings and they are wielding, I suppose, a level of power over these organisations that particularly they haven’t had in the past before.

4872,28D Chair,28D Chair_47,Q,"Yes, yeah.

4873,28D Chair,28D Chair_48,A,"I think it’s those other concerns. I think what we’re seeing since the – I mean, I’m happy all boards, including listed companies, have now been under significant pressure to sort out their lack of diversity on boards over the years. And now we see ASX200 companies, I think they’re at 30% now, which was the goal. Well, now major – well, major organisations such as [unclear] 00:08:39 are now saying ‘we want more than that’, so I think they’re pushing harder, which I think is right.","{'sadness': 0, 'anger': 0, 'fear': 0, 'surprise': 0, 'disgust': 0, 'anticipation': 0.029, 'joy': 0.265, 'trust': 1.0328}","['well,', 'Well,', 'I’m', 'right.', 'we’re']"
4874,28D Chair,28D Chair_49,A,"So I think because listed companies do have – there are major shareholders that are wielding significant power, as they are in the public eye they have to find the right people to make up the best boards, otherwise they’re going to continue to be under pressure. And you see that with the three or whatever it is left of the ASX200 companies that don’t have any women, and they’re continuously – their names comes up, that they should have done something a bit better by now and that issue won’t go away. And I think if anything they are more in the spotlight when it comes to seeking diversity on their boards.","{'sadness': 0, 'anger': 0, 'fear': 0, 'surprise': 0, 'disgust': 0.002, 'anticipation': 0.04, 'joy': 0.23500000000000001, 'trust': 0.765}","['better', 'done', 'they’re', 'they’re', 'power,']"
4875,28D Chair,28D Chair_5,A,"I do and that was completed - early this year it was conferred, and that was on – it was a qualitative study where I interviewed 41 ASX200 directors on how they govern under the ASX Corporate Governance Council principals and recommendations.

4876,28D Chair,28D Chair_50,A,"It’s interesting in my research when I asked directors about their recommendations around diversity, and also about appointment and re-appointment, and they talked about - basically my findings show that there were two schools of thought around diversity. Sorry, around recruitment to boards across the ASX200. And one school of thought was around that you should use existing networks and you should talk to people about who do they know. So you need the ability to be able to ask somebody that you trust about this person, or if it’s them themselves, because it’s too risky to end up with someone on the board that doesn’t work out, because you can’t get rid of directors easily if they’re – if it’s not working. And because we are all collectively responsible, it’s really important that you can work together.","{'sadness': 0, 'anger': 0, 'fear': 0.061, 'disgust': 0.087, 'surprise': 0.128, 'joy': 0.158, 'anticipation': 0.25, 'trust': 0.35600000000000004}","['should', 'should', 'can', 'know.', 'because']"
4877,28D Chair,28D Chair_51,A,"And the second school of thought was in complete contrast, and it was basically, well, no, I don’t accept it when – I go to recruiters and I ask them for good names, and if they come back with all men, I say ‘I don’t accept that, you need to go look harder and cast the net wider and find me people, because there have to be women out there that would be suitable for my board’. So they were very much saying that’s a cop-out first of all. No, you’re not looking hard enough, and don’t tell us that you have to play it safe and get known commodities on the board to make sure it works.","{'fear': 0.015, 'anticipation': 0.016, 'joy': 0.051, 'trust': 0.051, 'surprise': 0.08, 'anger': 0.084, 'sadness': 0.182, 'disgust': 0.5640000000000001}","['No,', 'no,', 'not', 'don’t', 'don’t']"
4878,28D Chair,28D Chair_52,A,So I think there is definitely – the tide is changing and there is now not one school of thought around how you recruit but there is two.

4880,28D Chair,28D Chair_54,A,"No, it wasn’t, and it wasn’t really a gender difference. I [think that] (this participant drew these findings (Three rs: relationship, risk and remuneration) from her PHD which she is willing to give us access if you wish)…..ASX200 directors predominantly focus relationships, risk, and renumeration. And relationships is about …….effective working relationships between board members, and with the executive, and with key stakeholders. And without those relationships working and the presence of trust and things like that, that you actually can’t govern effectively because you’re not there every day.

4881,28D Chair,28D Chair_55,A,"And risk was about the danger of getting it wrong, and that – it was about internal risk and external risk. External being what’s coming over the horizon at me that I hadn’t predicted? What new competitor is going to pop up tomorrow with a brand new business model that will disrupt mine?

So it wasn’t – and actually both of those entities now are 100 years old this year – the antecedent entities. And so the mindset of the board, because it wasn’t diverse, was, “We’re a fertiliser business.” Now, interestingly, we had a [inaudible] 00:10:04 moment when we bought a business from BHP called Southern Cross Fertilisers.

In fact, we actually think it’s not the new [norm or] 00:11:22 it will come back.” And also, when we look at our business, we actually don’t like fertiliser industry, because of its volatility, and actually you want it to go global, which we wanted to do – rather than being $10 billion you had to be $80 billion.

So, typically you need - the skills that you require is a very, very strong financial skill, you need a very, very strong legal skill.  Typically, you - well, unquestionably, you need a very, very strong corporate governance skill and then depending on the organisation, you may need a marketing skill if it’s relevant.

I know the dictionary says that’s what it means, but some people there’s a whole lot of baggage that can come with a particular word like conflict.

Now, the other thing that I haven't actually experienced either, but could be an impact here, is the connection between a shareholder and a Board member.

No, but it's something that we're aware a major shareholder might have a Board seat and they're there to try and make sure that shareholder's views are the ones that the Board accepts.

That's probably the thing that I've noticed the most in the last period of time, is that Boards really have to be much more understanding of how the business really works. But as a Board member, it's hard to know all aspects, so therefore making sure that the Board is composed of people who can complement one another and create the value that a Board should have as a team.","{'sadness': 0, 'anger': 0, 'fear': 0, 'surprise': 0, 'disgust': 0.008, 'joy': 0.257, 'anticipation': 0.289, 'trust': 0.487}","['changed,', 'changed.', ""That's"", ""it's"", ""it's""]"

The technologies, they're re-arranging of business models, the evolution of customer demand, the scrutiny from Regulators and from society in general, is way stronger now than it was previously, and continues. I guess from that perspective, that Boards, whilst not becoming management, have to understand a lot more about what management is doing, how they're thinking and what's impacting the business. And if they can't trust the decisions that are made inside the business - there's significant destruction going on all over the business world which the Boards really need to understand what that means. It has various impacts in terms of somebody in the Board really needs to understand why and how a business model might need to change; and then somebody else, and quite possibly somebody else, would need to then understand, well what does that do to governance, to reporting requirements and to structures? Then somebody else might need to know what that really means in terms of the financials and how profitability would be impacted, et cetera.

Then the second one is, assuming that the startup is actually starting to sell their product, how do you scale that into a mature business? And that again, is another specific skill.

So that side of it needs to be parked there as well. Yes, there are definitely situations where - but you can always buy in legal services, it's more the ability to identify that there is a potential or a problem, to enable to actually access the expertise as required.

We just around the table on that basis and what we've found a number of times, is it has changed our decision because we've able to see it through a different eye, we see it with different lenses kind of thing.

'Good and bad' is probably not the right words, but better or worse in that situation. So what you're actually finding is that peer reviewing and trends are important elements for making decisions, and to be able to do that, you have to be tapped into the social networks out there, so you need to be across what's going on, say in Twitter and other things like that, to be able to manage your organisation either to respond to situations which may be negative, or to take opportunities that may be positive, or even to benchmark or make a decision about which way a business should go, based on their customers who might be trending or whatever.

I guess this is why boards often will ask for a mix of people at the board, but they often will go for the education and skill base of a lawyer, a marketing person, an IT person.

I mean, and it's quite hard to do that, so perhaps that's why you need a couple of people on the exercise sort of thing, or to just back and forth. So, generally boards that have got nominations, would need to be your next part. Often they’ve done the head hunt, but not always. Sometimes the head hunt is useful, but sometimes they're not. Some of the roles the head hunter is often trying to get on the board a bit more broadly, on the sort of person that might be suitable. I mean, the classic example is that we’ve got somebody to fill in the board of this energy company and of course they expect them to work in the energy sector. Well, that may not be a good idea, and I'd suggest that if it's a large developed company, it's probably a really poor idea.

Now they've been in [the past] 00:37:06 moving consumer goods, and these people have been - more bulk good, or whatever, so that's diversity? I think not, sort of thing.

If you're a board member you've got to understand that you operate in an environment where you don't have all the information, so you're making decisions in circumstances where you're not all knowing, and there are always risks on the horizon that perhaps you have not contemplated.

I mean, risk assessment or risk matrices or risk whatever are one of the very key things that boards are expected to pay attention to, because remember, if you're a board member you don't know completely how an organisation works in every detail, but you do bring with you in that board role a range of experiences from other places, and the value you add as a board member is often your understandings of what happens in other places to add value to the board that you're sitting on today, sort of thing. It's your life experiences that you bring. Those are particularly valuable when you think about risk spaces and organisation. And an example the other day that rose in a meeting was that somebody said the top two risks in this organisation are A and B, and clearly they decided that from their perspective as an executive in front of the organisation. And in fact, they sort of made the classic mistake and forgot about the customers in the sense that perhaps there are some more important risks than the ones that have been mentioned up to that point, like safety and customer engagement stuff. So, we as an outsider could appreciate that and add a bit of value. That’s sort of a simple example, but board members potentially have got great value to add from their life experiences, when thinking about, in particular, risk, in my humble opinion.","{'sadness': 0, 'anger': 0, 'fear': 0, 'surprise': 0, 'disgust': 0.016, 'anticipation': 0.05, 'joy': 0.159, 'trust': 0.816}","['That’s', 'clearly', 'understandings', 'opinion.', 'decided']"

So it would be preferable, or else equal, to hire the younger female, who doesn’t have an Anglo-Saxon background, and has some really good experience in technology and marketing onto the board of my staid old company. But I’ve got another candidate who’s not those things but is other things, and he’s male, and he’s older, and I evaluate that. And I think well, what will my shareholders make of it if they find out that I had the opportunity to hire that person onto my board, but I hired the other person, who doesn’t have any experience, who I think could be great, but it feels like a bit of a risk to me.
