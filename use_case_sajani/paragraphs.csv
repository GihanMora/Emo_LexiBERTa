10D,10D_1,Q,"Thank you [Participant] 00:00:05. We'll deidentify, so I'll remove the name from the script and give you a code. I'm really pleased that you've agreed to be - to participate in this. I've looked at your background; software industries, and now for-purpose industry is your focus."
10D,10D_10,Q,Sounds pretty good. How many boards do you sit on?
10D,10D_100,A,"For instance, a good example of that. If there is a problem - if there's a problem in [long pause] - so the latest royal inquiry. It does have an impact on for-purpose organisation because everyone immediately goes, governance, we've got to tighten up or we've got to go back and look at - you sort of go, hang on a second. Let's just put that to one side. Let's just have a look at how we're running and what's the culture like before you actually - so there are impacts. Or the market's tanked in the US and you've got this bequest fund [inaudible] 00:29:09 it's going to impact our ability to perform over there. There are impacts, but it's just more at the margin in some of those organisations."
10D,10D_101,Q,"So choice of the bang - sorry, the board's decisions about its sources of capital is really key to managing -"
10D,10D_102,A,"For for profit organisations, yep."
10D,10D_103,Q,"For for profit. Yep. For managing diversity, it would seem."
10D,10D_104,A,"Well it can be. It's not key, but it can have an impact on - because [long pause] that constant tension between long and short term is there and it's not for everyone. And because business is moving faster than it ever has - I mean, I don't know how people can work in - I couldn't work in a business today. Just the amount of information and data flowing; it becomes really difficult to - it's very difficult, I think, to get that - to attract the right people who can deal with that. And if you – so, for example -"
10D,10D_105,A,"It just comes back to the [very start] 00:30:22 of our conversation. If you have been trained to think like this and you've got a bit broader in your thinking as you've got a bit older, as it turns out, had some experience, but, in the meantime, the world's like this, how do you deal with that? Whereas actually, if you've grown up in that space - so again, it's back to beyond gender. Age diversity - even just what you've experienced - and you see a little bit more of it, but it's still couched very much in this gender conversation. Which is interesting, but misses the point completely, in my view."
10D,10D_106,Q,"You're not alone. This is coming out - this is a theme coming out. So it's good. Do you think that there's - you do, I think. There's a situational context that might cause you to change your importance rating for high uncertainty - for diversity. So in for profit situations where short term decision making is - a short term frame is being imposed by influential capital institutions -"
10D,10D_107,A,"Potentially, yeah."
10D,10D_108,Q,"- that could be a situation that would put pressure - so that tension between short and long term thinking, priorities - because of the capital - if I'm understanding it -"
10D,10D_109,A,"Yeah. It could. For example, if BHP turned up tomorrow and said, we've got a 25-year-old - we'll use my example, [inaudible] 00:31:56. Twenty-five year old, Chinese-born – first-generation, Chinese-born, 25-year-old blah-blah-blah with this experience [inaudible] 00:32:04 - they go, well hang on, that's ridiculous. There'd be a massive backlash. You've got no experience. She mightn't in the vein that you're thinking, which is all about short term profits and stuff. But actually, in longer term, helping the board think through how - and BHP's probably not an example. Banks [are] probably a better example actually, now I think about it - Westpac. They'd still - there'd be a massive backlash. No experience, blah-blah-blah. What are you doing? So they just wouldn't do it."
10D,10D_11,A,A number. But it's -
10D,10D_110,Q,"Yeah, yeah. Irresponsible."
10D,10D_111,A,"Yeah, irresponsible. Even someone who's - you see some women with good backgrounds and they're in their 40s and they're like, oh well, you know, what's she - but it's okay. You've ticked the box so that's - it's like - because their focus is, you know what? We've got to have good bankers. Which is right. But you also have diversity because, basically, banking's dealing with a bunch of consumers as well. And if you've got no one around the board who's actually used an app, who understands WeChat or any of that sort of stuff - which most won't. Or go and - well we'll learn, because we'll go on a study tour to the west coast of the US and we'll charge them - like please, it's just ridiculous."
10D,10D_112,Q,It's a no-brainer. Yeah.
10D,10D_113,A,"So it does have an impact, in my view. [Overtalking] 00:33:24."
10D,10D_114,Q,Yep. [Inaudible] 00:33:28. Do you think there's a particular kind of diversity that matters more than others? Or do you think that's situation dependent?
10D,10D_115,A,"Yeah, it's very much situation dependent."
10D,10D_116,Q,And you've given me an example of the young woman at the school. Because she's [overtalking] 00:33:51 -
10D,10D_117,A,Yeah. It's situation dependent on so many different things.
10D,10D_118,Q,[Inaudible] 00:33:54.
10D,10D_119,A,Well how is the board performing today? What difference is that person you add going to make in terms of the way that board works? What things are missing? What's the dynamic with the CEO and the management team? What particular challenges is that organisation facing or going to face? There's just so many different things that - are they B2B versus B2C? Are they B2B2C? What are they? There's just so many things. So that's why I look at it as you've just got to approach it on a case by case basis. Which is why I'm interested to see how can you come up with model? I struggle [overtalking] 00:34:39 -
10D,10D_12,Q,More than five?
10D,10D_120,Q,Yeah. A very good concept of trying to come up with a model -
10D,10D_121,A,- with a model. It doesn't make sense to me.
10D,10D_122,Q,"It doesn't matter. Models can be pretty organic. Ideas of models can be very schematic; a bit like a philosophical concept. You know, three words [laugh] with interesting - I don't know. I don't know. It obviously can't be a causal model."
10D,10D_123,A,I think they'd struggle.
10D,10D_124,Q,"Because of - yeah, there's too many factors and uncertainties."
10D,10D_125,A,"Well you could. But you run the risk of coming up with the wrong answer. Because you've targeted that because that's what the data seems to be saying, but what [inaudible] [overtalking] 00:35:15 all that stuff -"
10D,10D_126,Q,"Yeah, yeah. This is qualitative research and I'm very qualitative. The models that I do are more concepts so you get the sense of the complexity rather than -"
10D,10D_127,A,Yep.
10D,10D_128,Q,Board functioning. We want to understand how diversity influences board functioning. Can you describe -
10D,10D_129,A,"Well it can, but it ends up coming down to whether the chair is able to manage it in a way - so everyone's different. It's how do you manage the setting to allow people to - create space for people to step into to have their views aired, heard, discussed, debated in a constructive, supportive way. The good ones do it really well. The bad ones don't do it at all."
10D,10D_13,A,"Yeah, yeah, more than five. But I don't - I've got a bunch that are small and private."
10D,10D_130,Q,"Is it an investment, do you think? It takes a while?"
10D,10D_131,A,"Yeah, yeah. It's a skill. That's on the skills matrix [overtalking] 00:36:12 -"
10D,10D_132,Q,That's on the skills matrix [laugh] -
10D,10D_133,A,"- for the chair. And unfortunately, it does come with experience. I would always say to - we've got a pretty good chair at MLC. That's why I was comfortable to recommend that [Gabrielle] stick her hand up. Whereas it probably wouldn't work on another board I'm on where there would be no - this particular chair is - he's fine, but it's not the greatest dynamic. So it wouldn't work. Right?"
10D,10D_134,Q,"Yeah. Because even if she got on for some token reason, she wouldn't be able to [overtalking] 00:36:46 -"
10D,10D_135,A,"Well even if the board accepted it, you've still got to be able to perform in that and you've got to be able to create the right environment. And not everyone's good at that."
10D,10D_136,Q,Yes. It would be then token. Is that right?
10D,10D_137,A,"Yeah, possibly."
10D,10D_138,Q,Yeah. Or [overtalking] 00:37:00.
10D,10D_139,A,Well intentioned but ineffective.
10D,10D_14,Q,"When you say private, do you mean they're not-for-profit or -"
10D,10D_140,Q,"Ineffective. Because another question down here is about how the voice of the person from a - maybe a different background or a disadvantaged, less powerful, influential background - let's say everyone's men and there's one female or everyone's from drives Ferraris and one person uses the tram and doesn't have a Ferrari and didn't go to a private school - so socioeconomic differences - so those sort of differences, if there's not the space created, what's that look like? Can you - do you know what I mean? I'm trying to get a feel for - is it conflict? Is it -"
10D,10D_141,A,"No, it's not conflict. It's just they don't get a voice and they withdraw. See, when I say creating space, you've actually got to ask open-ended questions and invite people into the conversation sometimes. Particularly people who feel like, actually, I'm sitting - now it can happen in both - it can happen a different way, as well, where someone feels like <groans> I'm here [inaudible] 00:38:15 - now I need to get thing - and that's not constructive as well. So again, it just comes back to - particularly it’s the role of the chair to create the right environment to allow everyone to contribute. And that's how it can be effective."
10D,10D_142,A,"The flip side to that is, if they don't, then the person either withdraws or tries to inject themselves and it does create tension. Maybe not conflict, but at least tension. Which is not - tension's okay, but, at a point, becomes destructive."
10D,10D_143,Q,Can you describe that shift? Give me an example.
10D,10D_144,A,"I was on a board some years ago where the chair was ineffective. Actually, I got frustrated because I didn't feel I was getting a voice and there was just this lots of stuff going around. In retrospect, I injected in a way that was not healthy and created some conflict by getting quite forceful with - like I need to say and here's what I'm really feeling about these things is wrong. And what [inaudible] 00:39:25 it took a couple of months to recoup it."
10D,10D_145,A,"But what it pointed out was it was a bit dysfunctional and that this particular chair was not performing right. So that led to a whole set of different conversations. Which, in the end, worked out because that chair moved on and we've got a much better chair. And all of a sudden, the dynamic - not much else has changed around the board other than that. So some conflict can flesh stuff out, but it's also quite painful. [Long pause] and that's another example of someone who was on a board because it was all about me."
10D,10D_146,Q,Yep. They didn't have the skills -
10D,10D_147,A,"Didn't have the skills or the awareness just to go, actually, this is a broader thing and if I do this right, I will benefit from it. But it was all about this is my opinion, this is my view, and you can't do that because that will upset over here and I don't want that on my CV. It's like, okay. So, it was an interesting dynamic. But in the end, it worked out."
10D,10D_148,Q,"But interestingly, a skills matrix would not bring that out, would it?"
10D,10D_149,A,No.
10D,10D_15,A,"No, they're private for profit. They're not listed. They're not public companies. So they're private investments. Mainly software. Some of them, I sit on the board of. Some of them, I don't but I just spend time with the CEO because they're a bit more - less formal, which is not necessarily a great thing. So it's partly how do you mature an organisation. So, I don't know, there's a couple I sit on the board of, a couple I don't, but just spend time with the CEO as and when required. Or roll up my sleeves and help on a project. Then there's three that I do sit on the board of in a not-for-profit, or for-purpose, I would say. Then there's two which I call professional director; larger companies. [Overtalking] 00:04:25 six or seven."
10D,10D_150,Q,For the chair.
10D,10D_151,A,"This particular person ticked all the boxes according to the previous chair and board. Ticked all the boxes. Female, IT, [inaudible] 00:40:39, all those sort of things. But there was no dynamic on personality or engagement; all of those - which - anyway -"
10D,10D_152,Q,"Yeah. The soft skills. Okay. We want to understand - [mumbling/reading not transcribed] [long pause] Okay, look, I think you'd be really useful in answering this specifically. Are there any board functions that you feel diversity has little bearing on or none at all?"
10D,10D_153,A,No.
10D,10D_154,Q,What about that capitalist situation?
10D,10D_155,A,"We still need - I mean, again, that comes down to what's diversity at that point? Do you have a - even that's got a conversation. Do you have a fund manager, an asset consultant, an accountant, a lawyer? That's diversity, right? That's just diversity about thinking about a particular problem. So you're always going to have - you should always have - if you've got five accountants sitting around, you'll come up with exactly the same answer. Is that diversity? Nope."
10D,10D_156,Q,I'm smiling with glee because you said what is diversity at that point? That encapsulates it. It encapsulates what you're saying. It is so dynamic.
10D,10D_157,A,And it's very situational specific [overtalking] 00:42:00 -
10D,10D_158,Q,Exactly.
10D,10D_159,A,"And even within an organisation, to a - and you keep going down - yeah -"
10D,10D_16,Q,"Wow. Wonderful mix. We'll be drawing on that. In your answers, if you need to specify, say this is in the for profit sector - but because of this diversity you have - of experience at board level, it will be really helpful to compare and to say, well look, in this sector, in this type of - like you said private, not listed, for profit - you see, that's not even a category we have [laugh]."
10D,10D_160,Q,What decision are we looking at at this moment? What's the problem we're trying to solve or -
10D,10D_161,A,Yeah. What thinking do we need to bring around to make sure we actually cover a problem?
10D,10D_162,Q,Beautiful. I love it. That's it quotes. Now I'd like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict. You've described a bit the tension between - the difference between tension and conflict. Is there anything further you want to say about that?
10D,10D_163,A,No. [Inaudible] 00:42:31.
10D,10D_164,Q,There's a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and board functioning. Cognitive diversity; have you heard that term?
10D,10D_165,A,I have. Don’t understand it.
10D,10D_166,Q,"Yeah. There's some literature on it which talks about it as different approaches to problem solving, different perspectives or different information processing styles. So it's very cognitive, whereas you were talking [overtalking] 00:42:55 -"
10D,10D_167,A,"Yeah. It's just another [overtalking] 00:42:56. [Long pause] but it's also think - so if I understand that right, it's thinking. So I sit on the board where I'm pretty sure one of the guys is - it is a guy - is on the autism spectrum. He's very literal and he's got a really good application of thinking around frameworks. Because he needs to - as part of this - I need to have it sit within a framework every time I think about it, otherwise it's not good for - and he's really quite constructive in certain conversations. In other conversations, it's hopeless. Because it's not [inaudible] 00:43:38 - so it's trying to manage that. But that's another form of diversity that really can be quite powerful. Managed appropriately."
10D,10D_168,Q,Yeah. That would be really interesting because anxiety can be a problem -
10D,10D_169,A,"Yep. That then brings out a manifest in different emotional responses. Which then can bring in tension to conflict. You know, all of a sudden, the whole constructive - I think you've got to have a bit of tension in certain conversations to healthily debate. But it's a challenge to make sure it's managed and -"
10D,10D_17,A,Well it's a private company. It's raised some money and has a small number of shareholders.
10D,10D_170,Q,Yeah. So help to manage that would be good.
10D,10D_171,A,Yeah.
10D,10D_172,Q,"When identifying potential new members, you've talked about - okay, we'll move on. Do people inside the board influence your selection process? Yeah. How does your subcommittee work with a head hunter or whatever you'd call them?"
10D,10D_173,A,It just depends on the circumstances again.
10D,10D_174,Q,"It really varies, does it?"
10D,10D_175,A,Yeah.
10D,10D_176,Q,"Okay. Of course, you did talk about that enough then. Do you feel [inaudible] 00:44:43 [long pause]? Okay. Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process, for example, between, on the one hand, trying to obtain a collegiate fit and, on the other, trying to avoid group think? So this is, once again, focussed on problem solving, thinking. So collegiate fit; that they'll work - even with your diverse picture of culture and we don’t want to have everyone thinking the same way."
10D,10D_177,A,So what's the question?
10D,10D_178,Q,"Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process because of - some people want collegiate fit and are looking for that culture. And it could be a diverse culture. And others looking at, right, how do they think? We want someone who can think really differently."
10D,10D_179,A,"I can't answer that generically. I think it just - again, it will just depend on the situation, the board, how that conversation's structured, generally by the chair."
10D,10D_18,Q,But it's not listed.
10D,10D_180,Q,"See, I'm thinking the way you describe diversity - see, this is a - I think the way you describe diversity resolves that tension."
10D,10D_181,A,It should.
10D,10D_182,Q,"This is a tension that's in the literature, so it's not -"
10D,10D_183,A,"Yeah, it should."
10D,10D_184,Q,"I think the way you define it [long pause] encompasses both those things. Because you include personality and how that fits in with the culture - you don't want everyone the same - and the different values, [bases] 00:46:29 and all that sort of stuff that goes with it, plus the different ways people problem solve - you see that all as part of the diversity picture."
10D,10D_185,A,Yeah.
10D,10D_186,Q,So it's then - part of the broader question is how do the board manage diversity? Which we've talked about.
10D,10D_187,A,Yep.
10D,10D_188,Q,"Okay, that's interesting, because that's a bias in the literature. From your definition of diversity. Do the boards that you're familiar with have any barriers to managing -"
10D,10D_189,A,"I’m not sure that it's - maybe it is a bias. But it's a way of thinking that [I don't get] 00:46:54. Because it's coming from more of a traditional framework - this is how it - well no, it's not. But maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Anyway, I don't - I haven't read the literature."
10D,10D_19,A,Yeah. It's not a public company.
10D,10D_190,Q,"No, no. There's no right or wrong - literature varies. It's just that some literature will - it depends on what paradigm you're working from."
10D,10D_191,A,True.
10D,10D_192,Q,"But anyway, I'll be interested to connect your paper with your thinking with it. Do the boards that you're familiar with have any barriers to managing or building its diversity?"
10D,10D_193,A,Yes.
10D,10D_194,Q,How have you sought to overcome them? And were those barriers present five years ago?
10D,10D_195,A,"Yes, yes and yes [laugh]."
10D,10D_196,Q,Right. What sort of barriers are there then?
10D,10D_197,A,Well it's that whole thinking - this is how we think. It's not thinking well how does - how do other of our constituents think? Whether that be shareholders or customers or team or school students. How do they think? Because we think like this but - so that's the barrier. A closed mind. It's not asking questions about what should we and how should we and what's different. [Inaudible] [overtalking] 00:48:14 -
10D,10D_198,Q,[Overtalking] 00:48:14
10D,10D_199,A,"- let's do a skills - we need someone who's got an accountant - okay, great. Well we'll [inaudible] 00:48:18 - well that's fine, but that's just one dimension. It's just - you've got to go the other way. Anyway -"
10D,10D_2,A,"Well, it's part of it, yeah."
10D,10D_20,Q,"Okay. First, how have the composition of boards that you're familiar with changed over time? When did you first get on a board? How many years ago?"
10D,10D_200,Q,So a stakeholder focus is [overtalking] 00:48:31 -
10D,10D_201,A,Yeah. Think about who are our stakeholders. Well it's not missing. It's just - I guess I keep coming back to there's still this propensity for functionality. As opposed to -
10D,10D_202,Q,Engagement.
10D,10D_203,A,"engagement thinking, whatever you want to call it."
10D,10D_204,Q,Stakeholder engagement is not given as much importance as functionality. So why do you think this is the case?
10D,10D_205,A,That's changing. That is changing. But it's still a bit of lip service.
10D,10D_206,Q,Do you think there might be some institutional reasons why -
10D,10D_207,A,"Well, [this is why I] 00:49:03 come back to - so in my example, if Lindsay Maxsted said, I want to appoint a 25 - you know, I keep banging on about [Gabrielle] because it's just front of mind."
10D,10D_208,Q,She's a good example.
10D,10D_209,A,"She's a great example. There would be howls from the shareholders. Well that's bloody ridiculous. What experience - what could she possibly bring to bear? Now it's up to him to articulate that. But we've got this whole stakeholder group who are up and coming bank consumers who we're not - we're not thinking about how we're going to engage with them in ten, 15, 20 years now. Because we're all 60+, ex-bankers, or there's accountants, maybe a software person or an exCEO. But we can't possibly think like they do."
10D,10D_21,A,"Fifteen years ago. I haven't really thought about it in too much detail. But the requirements are different. There seems to be this driver, you know, you should sit on boards and - so I was like - so this is my perspective. There's a lot of people driving to get board seats because they think it's an entrée to stuff. And it's like, well no. The better performing boards I have seen are ones where people are curious and supportive and doing it for a broader reason rather than a me reason. And there's a lot of people who do it for a me reason. They want an income. They want status. They want blah-blah-blah. And most of those - I have a personal issue with that because I just don't think that's the right way to approach it. But that's just my view. So I don't have a broader perspective on boards because I haven't sat on huge amounts, but I've seen things go -"
10D,10D_210,Q,"So you see it as, okay, the stakeholders - the consumers - I'm wondering is there anything in the regulatory institutions that might be shaping this focus - priority given to functional dimensions of the board. No?"
10D,10D_211,A,"[Inaudible] 00:50:20. Because they're always five, ten, 15 years behind what's actually happening, writing checklists. The ASX have a checklist you've got to fill out. ASIC have a checklist you've got to fill out if you're a public company. It's like, okay, well that's fine. I can fill out a checklist. I can tick any box you'd like because I can justify it in any way you want. It's actually creating more of an issue rather than - that's because it's not - it's forcing people think about how they fit in the box, not how they fit outside the box. Do you know what I mean?"
10D,10D_212,Q,I do.
10D,10D_213,A,"How do I make sure I can tick that box, because I know I've got to. As opposed to how do I actually think about, outside the box, how I drive my business forward? Which is why everyone's swung to governance. Governance is about ticking boxes."
10D,10D_214,Q,So this bounded thinking. The boxes reinforce a bounded way of thinking.
10D,10D_215,A,"Yeah. Correct. I've got to figure out how I fit in the box, as opposed to how I fit outside the box."
10D,10D_216,Q,"Yeah. And that is reinforced. You're patted on the back when you do, so there's reinforcement."
10D,10D_217,A,Yeah. Tick. [Overtalking] 00:51:30. Yeah.
10D,10D_218,Q,"The board feels good. It's done its bit. And responsibility is redefined as fitting in with these boxes. It's those bounded, multi-level - bounded thinking. I like that. That's a good one. Okay, from a - how do you feel - so great. How do you feel about targets - gender targets and quotas to influence board diversity?"
10D,10D_219,A,Can't stand them.
10D,10D_22,A,"And I've probably more migrated to - and I've culled over time the boards where there's more of the ""it's about me"" to those that - where there's actual I'm giving something. Yes, I'm receiving in return sometimes. Not all the time. But I might be receiving return on my investment. I might be managing my investment. Or I might be getting a fee. But the boards that I see more effective - and that's because that's what I've focussed on is where there's a bunch of people who bring a wide set of skills, experience, thinking, but want to give that first. They want to get back. I love sitting on boards because I want to get back and - whether that's a remuneration or thing. But primarily, I've got to get learning back. If I don't get any learning back, what's the point?"
10D,10D_220,Q,[Laugh] do you want to say that in one sentence? Explain why.
10D,10D_221,A,Throw them out.
10D,10D_222,Q,Because?
10D,10D_223,A,Because they just - they're missing the point.
10D,10D_224,Q,"I'll go back to your definition of - definitions - I'll try and make it a definition of diversity because it's very interesting. The thing is, if the - we want more diversity on boards, let's say, and we want regulation as a lever to facilitate that."
10D,10D_225,A,Do you?
10D,10D_226,Q,"Well we might. Because we might think, well -"
10D,10D_227,A,Why do you want it?
10D,10D_228,Q,"Well we might think that that would help to boost it. It certainly has increased the number of women on boards, having targets."
10D,10D_229,A,Is that a good thing?
10D,10D_23,Q,I haven't heard that one. [Overtalking] 00:07:17 -
10D,10D_230,Q,"If you think that having more women on boards is a good thing, it's a good thing."
10D,10D_231,A,Really?
10D,10D_232,Q,To be able to measure it and show - well it's like a pat on the back. Isn't that a good thing?
10D,10D_233,A,Is it?
10D,10D_234,Q,So you would be sceptical about any regulation -
10D,10D_235,A,"Why would you - if I said to you, you've got to employ five research assistants. Two of the have to be female. You get 100 applications and the ten best just happen to be male. How would you feel?"
10D,10D_236,Q,You're compromised.
10D,10D_237,A,"Correct. That's how - so if there's a failure, the failure is not in the regulation. The failure is to take risks to help people get the experience they need to be performing. The failure is - and you're promulgating the failure by saying you've got to tick the box. You've got to tick the box because you've got to have a 50% diversity as measured in gender. That's wrong."
10D,10D_238,Q,"What if it was - see, I don't know. The things that you've identified that are [long pause] real diversity, the one that matters most to you, are hard to quantify and, therefore, measure."
10D,10D_239,A,"But why do you need to measure them? Measurement is in performance. So I look at it and go, how do you measure the success of an organisation. Which is an organism made up of many, many, many different things. Of which the board is a small part. But the fish rots from the head. That's how I feel about it. And if you don't get that bit right, ultimately, it will come home. It mightn't ruin you, but you'll underperform. So then you get to a question of what is performance and how do you measure success? And every organisation, again, is different because if you're a for-purpose organisation, you measures of success might be how many people did you help get shelter and a home or whatever it is. So look at it and go why are forcing success to be measured on how many people you have sitting on the board that are male or female? It's just dumb."
10D,10D_24,A,"That's just me personally, where I see things. But if you're not getting back - if you're not learning, well what are you doing? You might as well go and get a job, punch the clock."
10D,10D_240,Q,"The thing is, with regulation; it imposes an understanding of performance on an organisation that you believe should be developing its own measures of performance. Because they're the real ones. Is that -"
10D,10D_241,A,"Yeah. How can a regulator tell me how to run my business? I mean, within reason. Obviously you've got to - there's certain rules around how you operate and stuff. But if you're telling me how many people I need to have - it's like I - if I don't know my business and I don't think having half the workforce female is a help to my business, then I've probably got a problem anyway, because that's the world. So don't tell me that that's what I've got to do. Actually help me figure out a way to populate my business with the requisite skills and experience, personality types to be successful in whatever it is I'm choosing to do."
10D,10D_242,A,"And that then comes back to, well okay, so if I'm really good and I'm not getting enough - and I know half the population think like this and I know actually in my dynamic of my organisation, I get a good blend of response and interaction as a team if I'm half and half female/male, for example. Why wouldn't I spend money on working with a university to source - to help upskill graduates to make sure that what's coming through fills in better - do you know what I mean?"
10D,10D_243,Q,"Yeah, I do."
10D,10D_244,A,"And at a board level, why don't I spend time giving back to the community, because I'm helping myself, coaching. You do [overtalking] 00:56:58 -"
10D,10D_245,Q,Managers. Yeah.
10D,10D_246,A,"Yeah, yeah. What is it they need to be - and giving them - oooh, why don't I take a risk and put someone on my board that - it may not work out, but actually it's helping foster that - and you know what? Most people won't take that risk. In the public sense. Back to my example, and it's just an example, obviously. They won't because the capital providers will howl in protest when Lindsay turns up and says this is our new board member. She's 24 or 25. Again, I'm just banging on -"
10D,10D_247,Q,Yeah. And she's never been a CEO and she's never -
10D,10D_248,A,"Yeah, [overtalking] 00:57:32. She's an entrepreneur. She's really financially savvy. She knows how to use tech. And by the way, she speaks Chinese and she really understands - you know, he's got all this - I'm getting carried away now. [Inaudible] 00:57:46 and he won't do it because he'll probably get a REM strike next times around. As a backlash. Probably. Now I'm not sure that's necessarily the case. I think he takes more risks than others. But there's a vast thinking that I can't take that risk."
10D,10D_249,Q,So risk perceptions of the media - do you think media plays a role in this?
10D,10D_25,Q,Exactly. You mentioned boards being effective. What do you mean by that?
10D,10D_250,A,"Yeah, probably."
10D,10D_251,Q,"I mean, Hayne's report has been a bit shaming the way it's been taken up by the media. It's been amazing -"
10D,10D_252,A,It's great. I think that's great. I think it's fabulous.
10D,10D_253,Q,I know. But from a board -
10D,10D_254,A,"Because it's straight back to you can tick all the boxes you bloody well like; if you don't drive a culture that is principles based and values based, you're going to fail."
10D,10D_255,Q,So then regulation could be more principles based and values based then. Instead of being measures -
10D,10D_256,A,"[Laugh] try that, yeah. Yeah, possibly."
10D,10D_257,Q,"- it's about culture. Finally, looking ten years into the future - this is our final question. Looking ten years into the future, how would you like to see diversity of Australian boards? Why do you think this would be good? And I think given how you've talked, what do you think needs to be done or what can be done to enable boards to more confidently manage the risks that might be, especially at the top end of town?"
10D,10D_258,A,"[Inaudible] 00:59:09. The risk at the top end of town of stuffing up has a massive impact. If a big bank fell over, for example, the impact on all of us would be horrific. Well, quite alarming anyway. So how do they [inaudible] 00:59:26? Well again, I guess we're - this is where the governance is. Well I'm managing risk. Well are you really managing risk or are you managing what you've been told is a regulatory approach to - and if you've done that, you should be fine. How does someone in ASIC have the foggiest notion about really what's going on in your business? They don’t. APRA probably should have around banks and capital but, honestly, they don't because the dynamic is [inaudible] 00:59:55 push that to one side and say, the risks you've got to take are encouraging diversity in thinking. And possibly that means you've got to put your neck out there a bit more. And there are ways to do that as well. You don't have to appoint someone immediately to a board. You can have [overtalking] 01:00:14 -"
10D,10D_259,Q,[Subcommittee] 01:00:14.
10D,10D_26,A,Being able to constructively have conversations around hard issues and provide the right support to the CEO.
10D,10D_260,A,Or subcommittee. Or you can have an advisory group. There's many different ways again. But how do you actually bring that in and start that change? It's too slow.
10D,10D_261,Q,"Too slow. So in ten years' time, it won't be different enough."
10D,10D_262,A,I don't think so.
10D,10D_263,Q,Well that's a good way to end [laugh].
10D,10D_264,A,"Well I don't think so unless something fundamentally changes. But that means this generation - and it is a generational change - have to wake up. But why are we having - so one of the organisations we spend a lot of time supporting and money supporting is AYCC, Australian Youth Climate Coalition. They're absolutely focussed on climate change. Yet we've got all these politicians who are 30, 40 years, 50 years older who have not the slightest clue because they're all - the vested interests are different. And you're soft of going - we're fundamentally - I'm sorry. I'll crap on now. But there's a societal change that needs to happen far faster. And actually, some of the younger people have got their heads screwed on."
10D,10D_265,Q,"Yeah, I think so."
10D,10D_266,A,"But nothing's going to change until this generation wake up and go, you know what? Actually, we're onto something. We need to move with it."
10D,10D_267,Q,The baby boomers are really holding up this change.
10D,10D_268,A,Yep.
10D,10D_269,Q,So it's an age thing. Maybe age diversity would be better than gender [laugh] -
10D,10D_27,Q,"That is a really neat - I want to have that bolded, please, transcriber. It's a good definition. So how important do you think it is to have a diverse board? Let's say ten is extremely and one is not at all. Where would you put that diversity on boards?"
10D,10D_270,A,"[Overtalking] 01:01:41 first thing in my book is a massive one. For the experience. And everyone thinks, but you haven't had experience in running a bank or - no, of course. I couldn't possibly have because I'm 25. But what I have experienced is growing up with technology and how it's impacted and influenced my life and my peers. And how I think about the world in completely different ways to you. And how it's going to be my responsibility to clean up -"
10D,10D_271,Q,The situation left [laugh].
10D,10D_272,A, the mess that you guys have created.
10D,10D_273,Q,Yeah. Oh wow. Age diversity then.
10D,10D_274,A,Well that's part of it. There's plenty more.
10D,10D_275,Q,"Yeah, I know. You've given such a broad view. It's wonderful. I can't get over how different view - how so many different understandings of diversity and it - and it, in part, reflects -"
10D,10D_276,A,"Well that's diversity itself, isn't it?"
10D,10D_277,Q,I know. Exactly. But it's wonderful. It's wonderful. And this is not [long pause] - now I've interviewed quite a spectrum of age - not a lot of people - 15 people. But these spread - I haven't interviewed anyone below 30 though.
10D,10D_278,A,You need to.
10D,10D_279,Q,But it's hard. Yeah. What about your girl? Do you reckon -
10D,10D_28,A,It depends on how do you describe diversity?
10D,10D_280,A,"I could - [overtalking] 01:03:06 - yeah, no, she'd [love] 01:03:08 to. She loves this stuff."
10D,10D_281,Q,It would be amazing.
10D,10D_282,A,Just remind me your - shoot me an email and -
10D,10D_283,Q,[Overtalking] 01:03:17 I will send you a thank you -
10D,10D_284,A,Yep. And I'll pop you in touch with [Gabrielle] and [inaudible] 01:03:23. I think she's a good perspective. Yeah. Just another one that -
10D,10D_285,Q,It would be wonderful. It works -
10D,10D_29,Q,"Well then I'm just going to ask you that, but I don't want to [laugh] -"
10D,10D_3,Q,Can you just describe that for me? Give me a - your background - because it's really - it influences how you see diversity and it gives me a context for analysing this transcript.
10D,10D_30,A,Well how do you describe it?
10D,10D_31,Q,But I don't want to lead you. So it's your -
10D,10D_32,A,"Okay. So diversity in thinking, yes. I guess, again, I would say that I've seen - and this is just, again, [inaudible] 00:08:26 - there seems to be this swing to diversity is male/female - it's gender related. And I think [inaudible] 00:08:32 okay, maybe. But there's so much more around diversity that [long pause] - it's just - that's just - I don't get that, basically, that almost sole focus on it."
10D,10D_33,A,"To give you an example, one of the boards I sit on was MLC and there's a bunch of accountants and lawyers. There's a good mix of male and female. There's a psychologist. There's a couple of educators. Which is all great. So we went through - each year, some come up for retirement. Some have to leave because they're up for the term. Everyone wants to be on this board. So it's like, okay, I got there for a different reason, but [long pause] - when it came up, there was a couple of people - people apply regularly. There's a mix of old collegians and some - but the one thing -"
10D,10D_34,A,"One of the people who I encouraged to put her hat in the ring is an Australian born Chinese. She's 24. She's female. She's bilingual. She's tech-savvy. She's an entrepreneur. She's got all of these things that we just didn't have - and a lot of people sitting around the board going, but she's very young and [inaudible] 00:09:58 go, yep. But that's okay. How's she going to learn unless we - and she will bring a completely different set of thinking to it. And she has."
10D,10D_35,Q,So she got on.
10D,10D_36,A,"She got on. Which is great. And it's fabulous. She's been a great contributor. She's very thoughtful, and she goes and solicits advice and coaching. But they will still - that particular board - and it changes a bit over time. It's still very much in, well, we've got to have the right mix of female/males. I just go, okay, well, possibly we do. But what are the things - what are the conversations we're having? We're constantly having conversations around technology and the interaction of young people with technology. And how do you create careers for people in this new age? And we're all 45 to 50+. This is <makes swishing sound>. So that's just an example of diversity can represent all sorts of different things."
10D,10D_37,Q,"Now, Participant, you'll be pleased to know the name of the title of the research is Beyond Gender."
10D,10D_38,A,Good. Okay. That's [overtalking] 00:11:03 -
10D,10D_39,Q,"So that's - you're right on - exactly. No, no, no, it's good. So you're right on. Would that young girl have got on - young woman have got on the board if you didn't advocate for her?"
10D,10D_4,A,Right. What are you looking for in the background? [Overtalking] 00:00:46 history or what -
10D,10D_40,A,"I don't know. I'm not sure. To be honest, there was a lot of candidates. There's a nominations committee and they control that. Possibly she would have, but -"
10D,10D_41,Q,Would she have applied?
10D,10D_42,A,"That's a good question. I'd have to ask - I didn't ask her. But I did go and see - I knew - because we'd - she was - we've got a funnel - we've got these stakeholder - it's a complicated structure. But anyway, I'd identified - said you should throw your hat in the ring. She said, I was thinking about it. What do you reckon? And I said, absolutely you should. As long as you get feedback, even If you fail, you're on the track. You're getting feedback, you're learning what do I need to do, how do I position myself. Whether she would have or not, I don't know. She probably would have."
10D,10D_43,Q,"Now we do have questions about selection. Given you're on it, do you want to go to those questions? Because it makes it work well."
10D,10D_44,A,"Sure. Yeah, yeah."
10D,10D_45,Q,So the selection committee you described; how does that manage diversity?
10D,10D_46,A,"It's more - they use a skills matrix. So they're more focussed on skills, to be fair. So that's just one example."
10D,10D_47,Q,"And the skills; are they things like legal, financial -"
10D,10D_48,A,"Yeah. They've already got a bunch of lawyers, a bunch of accountants, so that sort of thing -"
10D,10D_49,Q,I know. [So the sort of thing that] [Overtalking] 00:12:43 background -
10D,10D_5,Q,"So, software - but what's for-purpose?"
10D,10D_50,A,"Yeah, yeah. So it's sort of skills background. So yeah, education's obviously important. We're doing a lot more building, so in the last thing, well actually, we need someone with construction experience and stuff because we don't know. So it's that sort of thing. But it's skills and experience at this functional level as opposed to an engagement level. Which is what I was trying to get across. How do we understand the engagement of a different set of people? So the skills matrix is interesting, but the engagement matrix in mind is another dimension."
10D,10D_51,Q,Have you seen -
10D,10D_52,A,"No, I haven't seen [inaudible] 00:13:30 do that."
10D,10D_53,Q,I'll do a search and see if I can find [overtalking] 00:13:32 -
10D,10D_54,A,"That's just how I think about it, again. But you do see - sometimes you see - I just had a cup of coffee with a guy who wants me to join their board. We're having a chat and he was describing it as skills; we need someone in the - knows how to engage with big corporates and blah-blah-blah and do sales stuff. And I said, well, is that a skill or is that an experience? How do you experience that? So it is a skill and you can describe it as a skill - so I think some do, but they just call it a skill. I'm not - so it could be. I just think about it as experience. You can - you can't - people think about skills as functional things, but I think about it as - that engagement piece is more of an emotional passion - it's how you think, how you be, as opposed to what you learn. There's an element of it, as you'd understand. But it's just a different element."
10D,10D_55,Q,Yeah. So [overtalking] 00:14:40 -
10D,10D_56,A,"People would describe it often as, “Oh, we need someone with B2B experience.” Okay, so what do you mean by that? “Well, they've done sales and they know how to do a contract.” I said, well is that it or do they know how to have multiple relationships with multiple stakeholders and are very passionate about that in a massive corporate, to get a whole bunch of people to make decisions? Is that a skill that you can learn? Yeah, possibly. Or is that something that's actually more natural because you relate to people differently? You know, naturally, how - I don't know. It's probably - but I tend to think some of these things - it's where you answer the question and say, it's probably more the person than the experience that then - that, to me, is more of an engagement piece - but that’s how I think about it."
10D,10D_57,A,"For example, going back to [Gabrielle] 00:15:33, who's the young lady who [inaudible] 00:15:35. I can't have that experience. She grew up in a different era with a different background. And she's very passionate about that background and how to engage with those particular communities and how to - it's not a skill. It's just you have to have been there and you have to be passionate about it. Which she was and still is, obviously. So how do you find that?"
10D,10D_58,Q,Yeah. [Inaudible] 00:16:07 identity that might link in with that idea.
10D,10D_59,A,"Possibly, yeah."
10D,10D_6,A,"I guess people talk not-for-profit and - my background, as I say, is software, but it really was accounting and finance. I'm not a software person, but I understand software and have been fortunate enough to participate in a few - invest in and participate in a few things that did well. And my belief is - which my wife shares - is that you've got to give back. Therefore, so I call for-purpose - we set up a foundation - we run that together. She mainly runs it; I sit behind the scenes. So that's part of it."
10D,10D_60,Q,Do you think head hunters might be able to help you? Apart from a skill matrix - like might be able to help you in that area?
10D,10D_61,A,"Yeah, yeah, sure."
10D,10D_62,Q,Do you use them on boards? Are they -
10D,10D_63,A,"Yeah. I still think you've got to own it. They'll come up [long pause] - most of them are good. But you know what? They want to get the search done, right. They're getting for fee. And yes, reputation's important. I want to get the right people and the right mix. So yes, they have their place. But you can't delegate, as a board, that responsibility. You can get help, but you can't - oh well, you've got that list and that's final. Well no, you've got to really know what it is you're looking for to be able to test it."
10D,10D_64,A,"And a really good - so a really good head hunter search firm - I've seen a couple who do quite well, and the people within a firm rather than actually the firm itself really know the right questions to ask to tease out of that chair or that CEO what is it you're really looking for. And the really good ones add real value in that sense. And really formulate - I heard you say that, but what I'm feeling you're actually saying is - is that right? Do you know what I mean?"
10D,10D_65,Q,"Yeah. So then the candidates that they get before you, you will - in interviewing them, you will experience that level of engagement [overtalking] 00:17:45 -"
10D,10D_66,A,"Yeah. We should. Yeah, you should."
10D,10D_67,Q,"So if you didn't experience that, what would you do? Would you go back to the drawing board? Do you think it - do enough people share this idea you have that -"
10D,10D_68,A,No.
10D,10D_69,Q,[Laugh] no.
10D,10D_7,A,"But also, generally, I split my time between some investment stuff, which I quite like, which is below the radar screen software stuff, not-for-profit or for-purpose stuff - so that's the foundation, involved in the school - so I sit on the board of the - I've got a number of kids. A few of them go to a particular school and I sit on that board. And that's part of [inaudible] 00:02:02, but it's also about learning."
10D,10D_70,A,"[Overtalking] 00:18:01. Again, it's an experience thing. Some of the boards - increasingly less, thankfully - and some of the stuff that I read - so I don't know this for sure and, in fact, Lindsay Maxsted got an office over here, so there's - [inaudible] 00:18:17 the chair of Westpac and TransUrban. He's a very accomplished director. He's in his 60s and stuff -"
10D,10D_71,Q,Do you think he would interview - could I interview him [laugh]?
10D,10D_72,A,[Laugh] [overtalking] 00:18:30
10D,10D_73,Q,"Yeah, no."
10D,10D_74,A,"But I just think there's a whole era and thinking that needs to change. I guess - [long pause] and the difference is there's a lot of professional directors around that have come through the ranks of maybe large corporate or a services firm. I mean, Lindsay was insolvency, KPMG. And it's not as though they're not great, but have they run a business? Do they get the broader dynamics? And that's the big end of town where governance just seems to have taken over - lose sight of why we're here and it becomes very rules based as opposed to principles based. And that's a disconnect. And that's probably a disconnect for me because I'm used to being in a business where it's all [inaudible] 00:19:29 today."
10D,10D_75,A,So here's an example. The Hayne Royal Commission - talk about culture - it's always been about culture. It's just the big end of town lost sight of that. That is principles based. And to run a principles based business is completely different to a rules based business.
10D,10D_76,Q,So compliance - the rules - complying with the rules is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath all this are the values and -
10D,10D_77,A,"Yeah. It's always been the case, but it's just that people lost sight of it. And my sense - and I don't want to be ageist, but there's an older generation that's still - had that concept of, well, actually no, it's about governance. Well, let's peel back what does governance really mean. It's just how you run a business in a way that makes sense for the constituents. All of them. In a way that is - that [inaudible] 00:20:15 personally. Sorry, I don't want [overtalking] 00:20:21 -"
10D,10D_78,Q,"This is - no, no, you're not. This is really interesting and it's useful. It links in with a broader concept of governance, which is including - underpinned by, say, ethical leadership and includes environmental concerns and social concerns and what's the purpose of your business if it doesn't contribute to that rather than short-term focussed thinking. So the bigger end of town, in the old days, before HIH, the global financial crisis was losing the plot. Is that - would you go back to then; this is where it was really at its height, this kind of thinking?"
10D,10D_79,A,I'm not sure when I - if I can do it on a [overtalking] 00:21:14 -
10D,10D_8,A,"Then there's another one that’s more of a cooperative, but really is about fostering - fostering in a different way, a - bringing together a bunch of small businesses to leverage each other to foster a brand and a way of [inaudible] 00:02:25. That's an odd one, but it's quite interesting again. So for me, that's the thing. Then another part is some larger boards that I sit on which, again, it's more about learning. I don't necessarily have much investment in them, but just meeting different people, understanding [inaudible] 00:02:41. So all of them are about learning different things in different spaces."
10D,10D_80,Q,Two thousand and seven?
10D,10D_81,A,"Yeah, but I'm not sure. I think it's just the [long pause] - the rise and rise of institutionalisation of money and the disintermediation of that money by a myriad of middle people who take a clip. And actually aren't that vested in the outcome. It's all about profit. That's how I view it. Particularly in public - but even in private - particular in PE. There's a role to play for different capital to come to work to thing. But I think people have lost the plot. There's just huge amounts of money to get washing around and there's a bunch of people who, behind the scenes, make decisions; fund managers and stuff. And they're all just making a clip. They're actually not that invested in the outcome other than their carry or their fee. But the broader perspective of a business doing good more broadly - you know, let's tick the box and make sure we're doing that. So rules based. But actually, it's still about profit."
10D,10D_82,Q,That's the finance industry. Do you think other industries are like that or is it a phenomena?
10D,10D_83,A,"Well that's the control of capital - well that's the control of capital to a vast chunk of commerce in this country. And in other countries. And the gatekeepers are - and they're being weeded out a bit, but there's still - the vested interests are very much about what's in it for them. And that's all about returns and that's all linked to profits, generally speaking, and growth and the constant drive for growth. Well sure. And they're measured quarterly, monthly, annually on their carry. So that’s where they're going to focus. Now if they were measured over ten years and they were paid over ten years and they had to perform over ten years, you might get a different outcome."
10D,10D_84,A,"But if you - again, I'm talking about the big end of town. But see, it stretches all the way down. <Sigh> boards, in the end, know that they live or die by the votes of their shareholders. And shareholders are increasingly sticking their hand up. And they've got this crude stick called the REM report - the remuneration report - to beat them over the head. Well that's bloody ridiculous. That's just silly. And it's because you can't have conversations with them and there isn't alignment."
10D,10D_85,A,"So if you said, as a board, we won't invest for the next five to ten years - and there's no many companies that do it - and the companies that do it often get hit - you read about Seek. They're constantly investing. People like it. They're a bit nervous because the short term profits are hit. MIB, where I used to work; same thing again. Got caned, so they went to private equity. See, it's -"
10D,10D_86,A,"Sorry, coming back to your question. It really is - there's a divergence - I think the problem is that the incentives for the people managing the capital are not aligned with this long term view. Which you have to take. Rome wasn't built in a day. And you've got to have all of these - but just ticking the box? Big woop. Do you know what I mean?"
10D,10D_87,Q,I do. This is changing the culture - this is the culture within which the - the institutional culture within which the board is operating.
10D,10D_88,A,"Yeah. So there are constraints and they can go - and they can have a long term view. But if their capital providers are incentivised and have a very short term view, which invariably they do in some areas of the market, it's just completely at odds."
10D,10D_89,Q,That’s really interesting. So capital and how it's institutionalised - capital and how it’s – is key. So are there institutions that - with a longer-term view are like super funds and things like that. Do you think they're [overtalking] 00:25:21 -
10D,10D_9,A,"The for-purpose one - the sector is largely private stuff, but then getting involved in other community things. I enjoy that because you meet different people, have a totally different perspective - and I can bring probably more of a business perspective, but just learn stuff about how other organisations operate. Which is entirely useful across everything. So that's - nothing more than that really. Nothing planned, but just turned out that way."
10D,10D_90,A,Well let's [overtalking] 00:25:24 -
10D,10D_91,Q,Or are they [overtalking] 00:25:24 -
10D,10D_92,A,"Well it depends. You're talking about industry super funds versus - so there are some - and there's a whole range of different capital providers. But some of those industry funds farm out their - farm out some of their capital to fund managers. Independent or otherwise. And their incentives are very much targeted on short term performance. Equally, you've got long term capital providers coming in from places like Canada - so there's a lot of Canadian pension funds who are chasing long tail assets here. But that all shifts to infrastructure. They're rather buy toll roads and ports and stuff where you've got a long - because what they're trying to do is match their liability to their members with long tail - some long tail assets. So there's all these different players. So how do you match that long tail up?"
10D,10D_93,A,"The short tail, which should be the long tail - forgive me [inaudible] 00:26:31 - if you're a big company - BHP. You've got a bunch of equity investors. Those equity investors could include some or probably all of those, but managed by four different purposes within the institutions. Very short term, in some cases. So how do you blend all of that? Because you've actually got a long tail view as a BHP. I've got this problem in - it was in Argentina or Brazil. I stuffed up and I've really got to recompense the locals for that. And the long term value of my business would improve if I actually came to the party and did it. But I've got all these shareholders going, don't give them $500 million. See if you can get it to $200 [million] or whatever the number is. Do you know what I mean? So there's just this absolute -"
10D,10D_94,Q,[Overtalking] 00:27:19
10D,10D_95,A,Yeah. Yeah. And it's a challenge for any board to manage.
10D,10D_96,Q,So through this institutional view that you've just given me from capitalism - well it's really global. It's not local.
10D,10D_97,A,Yeah.
10D,10D_98,Q,"Even though we're talking about Australian boards, we have to look at that global picture for finance. So Australia might have its regulators and institutional influences, but that picture is very much at the background of the board as it's making its decisions here in Australia, about Australian businesses. Even schools."
10D,10D_99,A,"Yeah. [Long pause] well not so much schools. But there is an impact. Everyone reads the same news. You've got to put the for-purpose stuff a bit to one side because, often, they're not tapping into that capital. But even private companies and public companies; they all tap into that capital and so there is a - there's an influence. And all of those people are involved in the for-purpose [inaudible] 00:28:27 school. So there is an impact."
11D,11D_1,Q,"So The participant, this research is looking at board diversity, and we’re - unlike the literature and a lot of other research, we’re actually going to people who are on boards and finding out their perception of diversity, how it’s managed, barriers to it.  Then from that we’ll dovetail it with the literature and we’ll see what sort of model we can come up with.  You're about my fourteenth interview, and it’s pretty exciting some of the views out there, and quite diverse views.  I'm really, I have not interviewed anyone like yourself, who is so entrepreneurial, because I had a look at your LinkedIn.  I remember law and there’s another?"
11D,11D_10,A,Yes.
11D,11D_100,Q,"You've got an interesting dynamic in that board, because of the minimum diversity and the constitution yeah.  Now the constitution, you're a lawyer and a chair, so are they sort of - do they come off a shelf these constitutions, are they pretty standard?"
11D,11D_101,A,"Generally, yeah."
11D,11D_102,Q,Could I find a typical sample of a constitution?
11D,11D_103,A,"Oh yeah, yeah.  I can send you one?"
11D,11D_104,Q,Could you?
11D,11D_105,A,"Yeah, that's' easy."
11D,11D_106,Q,"That would be brilliant, because this structures the complex dynamic that you're talking about."
11D,11D_107,A,"Yeah, no problem."
11D,11D_108,Q,"Brilliant, okay.  Thank you.  Is there anything, any function of the board that you feel diversity has little bearing on?  Just it’s irrelevant to?"
11D,11D_109,A,"No, even the pretty functional pieces like financial, they have an impact on the employees and everything else, and then when you're thinking about the legal side of stuff, or the strategy.  It needs diverse use so we’re capturing all the risks."
11D,11D_11,Q,Industry is IT?
11D,11D_110,Q,"You're clearly, there are some people who see it very mechanically, they see this as a machine.  Here's the board, here’s the industry, we’re separate.  We the board are quite separate to the operations.  You're saying you have this view of the board decision influence and have effects on a whole lot of people and things, including the employees in the organisation?"
11D,11D_111,A,Absolutely.
11D,11D_112,Q,You're not separating?  You see it quite organically as an interactive thing?
11D,11D_113,A,"We’re very separate structurally, absolutely.  But the decisions that we make, probably have the biggest impact on the employees.  The culture, even the budget that we’ve agreed, we chose and I pushed for a very aggressive budget target.  If we didn’t - and that’s had a massive impact on the organisation, both in terms of stretching it.  That decision alone has changed everything about that business.  It’s changed the structure, the conflict, the people they need in certain positions.  The flow on impacts of that, were probably the biggest that they've had, the biggest change that’s happened to that business.  That’s an example of how one decision, relating to one number that was a board decision, has flowed through and affected all employees, culture, HR, everything."
11D,11D_114,Q,You knew that because of the diversity on the board?
11D,11D_115,A,"Yes, because particularly because of like Chris had had a similar circumstance before, and so had I, we were able to triangulate and say, if we run the same play here, and stretch, go for a stretch, we’re going to have an outcome, a better outcome, so we pushed for it."
11D,11D_116,Q,Is Chris the investor?
11D,11D_117,A,"Chris is the investor, so it’s Chris and myself, pushing for a higher budget than the founders."
11D,11D_118,Q,"Good, okay.  So, you right, okay.  This is so different to other much literature that really doesn’t give voice to this kind of thing, so it’s fabulous.  I just want you to understand, i want more of it.  Now I'd like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards?  You've talked about it a bit.  How such conflict is managed.  I want you, because you’ve made it central, conflict is central to the process.  Can you explain the process of how you as chair, manage conflict constructively, to problem solve and strategies?"
11D,11D_119,A,"Yeah, so before each board meeting, we get the board papers, and each person individually will review them and have their own comments and points to make.  Then we come in to the board meeting, and then we quickly - things where there is agreement, we just don’t really spend much time on, and we’re really fishing for the areas of conflict, to bottom them out.  Then it’s really just a - it’s a discussion that’s moderated by me as the chair, and it’s timebound and we try and distil what’s really the difference of perspective and difference of view.  Then we just try and get as crisp as we can to enunciate, like what are the people’s different views?  Then set out a process for resolving them."
11D,11D_12,A,"So, it’s a smoke detector, it’s a compliance business, they do smoke detector inspections and gas inspections and stuff like that.  It’s actually a sort of technology and compliance business."
11D,11D_120,A,"When it came to the budget, it was, well why don’t you model out three different scenarios, and then we’ll have an interim meeting between now and the next board meeting, to work out what each of those scenarios would mean and where we’d land.  It’s more of a process for resolution, that’s pretty specific to the subject matter usually.  Another one was, so I felt that as a board member, as a non-executive director, I hadn’t invested in the business, like I was just paid, I'm just paid.  I felt that the other three directors have invested, like significantly.  I thought that in order for me to really make sure that I'm highly better aligned to the business and the board, I should invest myself as well."
11D,11D_121,A,"So,I asked to invest, and that was a controversial decision, because they don’t like other people investing in the business, a tightly held company.  There was effectively conflict around that, it wasn't like ding dong conflict, but the founders weren't interested, the other investor was, I was.  So again, we went through a process of where they got together between the board meetings, discussed it, positives and negatives.  Then we tabled it at the next board meeting, we discussed it and then they made a decision at the following board meeting.  So, there’s common that we don’t all agree, but then between one board meeting and another, we’ll get to agreement.  Because the whole thing, business moves pretty quickly so there's not many things that we can really afford to now sort of chew over for too long."
11D,11D_122,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  Do you have - what about if there’s a values conflict?  You've described it like what I see as a problem-solving process.  What about if there’s a values conflict?"
11D,11D_123,A,"So, have we had an example of a values conflict yet?  I think we’re pretty aligned on values.  I think it’s not so much about the values of the board members, but the values of the company, which is set by the founders.  In some ways the values of the company need to be owned and ingested by the board members.  So, if the board members don’t adopt those values, then they either need to try and change them, or probably get off the board I'd suggest."
11D,11D_124,Q,"Okay, so they're a given, they're like a framework for the board?"
11D,11D_125,A,"Well they're a given for the board, and then if the board, yeah again, so if I've joined a company and they're all about, like I'm a vegetarian for example.  If they were all about eating meat, I'd be either say well I don’t want to be on that board, or I propose that we change.  It’s a constraint on the board."
11D,11D_126,Q,"Yeah, and you wouldn't be on the board of an abattoir then?"
11D,11D_127,A,"No, so that's right."
11D,11D_128,Q,"Okay, good."
11D,11D_129,A,"It’s interesting when you say they, because I think there’s personal values of directors, which could be very difficult between directors.  But I think that the values of the company should trump the values of the actual board members, when it comes to making decisions.  Because the board is there to represent the board and the shareholders, which are encapsulated in the values of that, the shareholders and the board.  Not the personal values of the director."
11D,11D_13,Q,That’s the only board you've sat on so far?
11D,11D_130,Q,"When you talked about the impacts on employees and things, where does that value, that concern for employees?  Where does that come from?  Is that part of the investors?  Or is that part of stakeholders?  Or is that the founders?"
11D,11D_131,A,"So, in this circumstance, I think that it comes equally from each of the directors.  The voice of employees at the board level, is one of the voices that we consider.  It’s like shareholders, employees, and I'm not sure what other stakeholders we’re really focused on, and investors.  Yeah, the shareholders, employees, investors.  Interestingly, the shareholders and the investors are represented at the table, but the employees aren’t specifically represented at the table.  I think that there’s just a shared acknowledgment, that without employees, without them on board and looking after them, we don’t really have a business.  There's never really - there hasn’t yet been an issue where the interests of employees has been subservient.  It’s interesting -"
11D,11D_132,Q,There hasn’t been a conflict over how to manage that?
11D,11D_133,A,"There hasn’t been, but it’s interesting, because if there was a conflict at the moment, I fear that because there’s no specific employee representation, that would be a problem.  I wonder whether there should be more employee representation on boards?  AN IT COMPANY, because I used to report to that board, as an executive, there wasn’t employee representation either, shareholders yeah."
11D,11D_134,Q,But you reported to the board?
11D,11D_135,A,"Yeah, Ireported to the board as a manager there.  But when I look at the board structure -"
11D,11D_136,Q,That's how they got the voice?
11D,11D_137,A,"- I'm like yeah, but yeah, they got a voice because management advocated for employees.  I think that you're probably just, I think in this day and age, it just goes without saying, if you're not looking after employees, you're kind of not going to have a business for very long.  It probably doesn’t need specific representation on the board level."
11D,11D_138,Q,"Unless you had some really narrow minded, narrow focused person who just look, all that matters is shareholder wealth at the moment, and be damned, you know?"
11D,11D_139,A,"Yeah, so there are circumstances like that right."
11D,11D_14,A,"I sat on the board of my own start-up, as a director of that as well, for a few years.  That's probably the only other one, we had actually board meetings and everything else."
11D,11D_140,Q,"Yeah, you can be bought out or something."
11D,11D_141,A,"That’s right, so some private equity company’s come in and buy the business and just carve it up, and whatever happens to the employees happens, we’ll try and make some money on the way through.  I think that’s a certain motive operating that exists, and in which case they wouldn’t want the voice of employees on the board, in any event."
11D,11D_142,Q,"Yeah, and would they want diversity?"
11D,11D_143,A,"No, they just need to get a job done."
11D,11D_144,Q,"So that’s probably one situation, with these acquisitions sort of thing?"
11D,11D_145,A,"Yeah, so like carve ups, yeah, that would be one scenario.  They don’t really need diversity, but they're not - I would suggest they're not really acting as a board, like in that sense, because they're really just, they're just carrying out a certain mission, on behalf.  Yeah, so a lack of diversity would actually be a benefit in that circumstance, where you just want to get something done quickly, and single-mindedly, and yeah."
11D,11D_146,Q,But that’s a very isolated situation?
11D,11D_147,A,It is an isolated situation.
11D,11D_148,Q,And short-term?
11D,11D_149,A,"Yeah, and probably not sustainable as well.  Like I'm thinking about other projects that are short-term and very focused, like let’s say you're doing the cross-city tunnel or something.  You go we just need to get a tunnel across the city.  But even then, you can’t just say, just dig and dig and dig, and just keep digging, and make sure you get your 50 metres of tunnel a day.  Because you've got environmental constraints and all sorts of crazy stuff, so you need to oversee for that too."
11D,11D_15,Q,You can draw from either one?
11D,11D_150,Q,"Because I was wondering also, another value that might not be shared, which hasn’t come up, is the environment, and some board members mightn’t really care, and others might, in your board.  Have you made decisions that might bring that to the fore?  Conflict over that?"
11D,11D_151,A,"Not related to the environment, no."
11D,11D_152,Q,"Yeah, so -"
11D,11D_153,A,"We've made a lot that relate to customers and the health and wellbeing of customers and the safety, because it’s a compliance business.  I think that there’s just a shared view that the business is - the success of the business is underwritten on making sure that at the end of the day, tenants are safe in their houses.  It’s kind of unwritten that that is something that we need to do."
11D,11D_154,Q,"Now I'd like to explore how diversity might contribute, oh we’ve done that, we’ve done that, I love the way you talk about conflict.  There’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity, so by this we mean different approaches to problem solving, different perspectives.  You opened on this.  Do you feel that it influenced your board’s functioning?  You made it central.  Oh right, how might cognitive diversity, because you opened with that, how it influences problem solving, to manage risk and complexity.  How might cognitive diversity be identified, for example if selecting new board members?"
11D,11D_155,A,"Oh yeah, that’s an interesting one.  I guess you just need to test how people would think through certain problems in a case study environment, would probably be the easiest."
11D,11D_156,Q,Hop ons?  What did you say?
11D,11D_157,A,Problems.
11D,11D_158,Q,"Oh problems, you can obviously see I have a technology background."
11D,11D_159,A,"No, so exploring, tell me about how you thought through a certain issue, that would expose someone's way of thinking.  Yeah, cognitive diversity is important, like I think it’s almost like the, I don’t know how you describe it?  The personality is an important one, when I think of the board that we have at the moment.  We have not much diversity in terms of personality.  If we did a Meyers Briggs, I reckon we’d all land pretty similar.  Something that we find valuable here, is that everybody has a very different personality profile, and it’s actually pretty challenging working with people with a different personality profile."
11D,11D_16,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_160,Q,Do you mean here?
11D,11D_161,A,"Yeah, in my workplace."
11D,11D_162,Q,In your business?  Yeah.
11D,11D_163,A,"Yeah, so at the board level, we can actually move faster, because we’re all pretty much the same types of personalities.  We sort of just dispassionately break down issues, work out what the right answer is, move on, be quite transactional.  Whereas, others that might need to settle in to the idea a bit more, think about it more, whatever might feel more discomfort in that environment.  Interestingly Margo, before you came, a couple of hours ago I was having a chat with one of our employees, where I came out of a meeting, and I was completely excited and jazzed, like a client meeting.  They were just nonplussed, and I was probably at a 10 out of 10, and they were one out of 10.  I knew based on their profile that they would probably be a two or a three out of 10, but I was surprised that they were one out of 10, in terms of emotional excitement."
11D,11D_164,A,"I had to sit down and say what’s going on?  I kind of expected you to be pretty low energy, but not this low.  It was a pretty brutal meeting actually, because they felt offended that I was even calling it out.  I was like this is so obvious that I have to call it out.  They were like but you’re making judgments about my emotional response to something and I can’t affect that.  I was just trying to say, but I need to understand what it is, so I can actually understand.  We don’t have any of that stuff on the current board that I'm in, because we have probably not much cognitive diversity because we all approach problems cognitively, we process them in the same way."
11D,11D_165,Q,"Okay, well you're the chair, would you want to expand the board to increase cognitive diversity?"
11D,11D_166,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_167,Q,Given the importance you place on it?
11D,11D_168,A,Yeah.  Yeah.
11D,11D_169,Q,Is that something you plan to do?
11D,11D_17,Q,"With the start-up of course, that was another?"
11D,11D_170,A,"I hadn’t thought of it until now.  It’s interesting, because at what point do you reach a tipping point of more, like the board is highly effective at the moment, and efficient.  Adding in another voice might - we will become less efficient, but we would cover off more - we’d be more thorough and possibly cover off more risks.  So, we’ll try probably balancing efficiency with risk, with our current composition.  There is a question about whether there are risks that we’re missing, because we’re probably over indexing on efficiency at the moment.  But the type of people we are, and the type of business it is, I think we prefer to over index on efficiency, particularly at the stage of business, because it’s small and fast moving and technology and we can - if we see a risk, even if we see it a bit later than we otherwise would.  We can actually react to it faster and solve it anyway.  So, we’re probably making the right balance."
11D,11D_171,Q,"Do you think, that’s interesting, first of all, do you think risk and efficiency are always intention?  Like two ends of a spectrum?"
11D,11D_172,A,"I'd like to think not, but I reckon -"
11D,11D_173,Q,"You've got risk and complexity, you sort of had combined, is that like intention with efficiency?"
11D,11D_174,A,"So probably not, I think that you could have a scenario where you're highly efficient and still able to get a lot of like diversity and manage complexity and manage a lot of risk.  It’s probably not - it’s probably a short, you're right, there’s a short-term trade off.  Because if we brought someone else in like next month, it would take four, five months before we’d get the level of efficiency that we have today.  That’s probably just intertemporarally you'd take the hit."
11D,11D_175,Q,It would be an investment?
11D,11D_176,A,It's an investment.
11D,11D_177,Q,Do you think sometimes risk and opportunity are seen as similar?
11D,11D_178,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_179,Q,"So, there could be some opportunity costs as well, if you don’t have - I mean you haven’t -"
11D,11D_18,A,Yes.
11D,11D_180,A,"Yeah totally, so you're right, you're totally right.  I think there’s a board, you’re probably more focused on risk than opportunity, like I am."
11D,11D_181,Q,And you're an entrepreneur?
11D,11D_182,A,Yeah.  Because I think because the business itself and the strategy -
11D,11D_183,Q,Is up there?
11D,11D_184,A,"Is up, there’s such a big opportunity and they're running at it anyway.  I've got to keep the risks in check."
11D,11D_185,Q,"Okay, gotcha, but this is not, the business that you're on the board of, it’s not entrepreneurial?"
11D,11D_186,A,Yeah it is.
11D,11D_187,Q,It is?
11D,11D_188,A,They're really entrepreneurial?
11D,11D_189,Q,"Oh, I thought when you talk compliance, I think it’s something?"
11D,11D_19,Q,"That’s good, you can compare the two positions, it might be relevant, might not.  First, how does the composition on boards that you're familiar with, how have they changed over time, in terms of diversity do you think?"
11D,11D_190,A,"Oh no, it’s really entrepreneurial.  These guys basically have these technology platform, they’ve got 60 - you've probably seen them on the road, well you will now Detector Inspector.  They go around doing smoke detector inspections for rental properties, for landlords, and so they’ve got a technology platform, that basically arranges for all of theseengineers to go around and check smoke detectors, and make sure they're compliant and they're working and blah blah blah.  They’ve got aspirations in terms of opportunity, to enter in to different states and do different services, not just smoke detectors, but gas and all sorts of other services."
11D,11D_191,Q,Yeah water?
11D,11D_192,A,"Water and all sorts of other checks, and even just landlord checks.  If you've got a rental property then your landlord can come in a couple of times a year and just check that everything’s okay, like property inspection checks.  That’s another thing they can branch out in to.  There’s a lot of opportunity for them, each month we’re talking about buying different businesses and investing in different stuff.   I sort of don’t need to worry about that, because the DNA of the business is high opportunity focus."
11D,11D_193,Q,"Okay, so that's a bias in our discussion, that because you are focused on highly innovative businesses?"
11D,11D_194,A,"Yeah, only fast-moving innovative businesses."
11D,11D_195,Q,"Yeah, so risk is predominant, however you’ve said that opportunity would be there if it was, you know -"
11D,11D_196,A,"Yeah, opportunity’s baked in to the business already, so I need to worry about risk."
11D,11D_197,Q,"Yeah, but if it was Epworth Hospital or something like that?"
11D,11D_198,A,"Yeah, if it was Epworth, where it wasn’t about opportunity, and risk was sorted out because everything about the hospitals all about risk, and I'd be like where are the opportunities?"
11D,11D_199,Q,"Yeah exactly, you’d be [unclear] 00:46:18?"
11D,11D_2,A,And commerce.
11D,11D_20,A,"The board that I joined eight months ago, so that was deliberately with a view to gain diversity, because the business had just gained investment, and the private equity, sorry the venture capital fund that invested in it, wanted more diverse views on the board, so that’s why they brought myself in."
11D,11D_200,A,"Yeah, I think what happened was, we actually dealt with a lot of the opportunity of the business by canonising a strategy that’s like a three-year strategy, early in my - so we did that in the first quarter of me joining the board.  I was like we don’t have a good strategy, let’s get that sorted.  The opportunities kind of taken care of by the strategy and then the budget, which I explained to you before.  Which is like pretty stretched."
11D,11D_201,Q,"Yeah, and you've only been there eight months?"
11D,11D_202,A,"Yeah, it’s been a pretty crazy transformation, yeah."
11D,11D_203,Q,"Anyway, that’s really interesting.  Okay, so selecting new board members, you’ve said right, you use like a case study.  We’re on the last page.  Now managing diversity.  When identifying potential new members, does your board consider ways to increase diversity, and how is it done?"
11D,11D_204,A,"No, it was done pretty ad hoc.  They were basically charged with just get another director, and get that done."
11D,11D_205,Q,"Yeah, and law’s good?"
11D,11D_206,A,"Yeah, I don’t even think they looked at it in that detail."
11D,11D_207,Q,Really?
11D,11D_208,A,"No, I don’t think the guys probably knew that I was a lawyer until a few months ago."
11D,11D_209,Q,That’s really funny.  Do people outside the board influence this selection process do you think?
11D,11D_21,Q,"Great.  What importance do you think diverse boards have, 10 extremely, one, none?"
11D,11D_210,A,"No, not for that."
11D,11D_211,Q,"Your financial fellow did?  Oh, but he’s on the board now?"
11D,11D_212,A,"Yeah, he’s on the board."
11D,11D_213,Q,The investor?
11D,11D_214,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_215,Q,Because his is often like superannuation funds and that are big investors in the companies?
11D,11D_216,A,Yes.
11D,11D_217,Q,But this is not like that?
11D,11D_218,A,"No, that’s right, so there’s nothing like that, it’s pretty small stakes."
11D,11D_219,Q,"Yeah, and he’s on the board?"
11D,11D_22,A,"Oh 10, yeah 10, it’s all about the diversity of the view, yeah."
11D,11D_220,A,"He’s already on the board that investor.  But yeah, I mean investors absolutely influence in, but just not in this case."
11D,11D_221,Q,"Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process, example, between on the one hand trying to attain collegiate fit, and on the other trying to avoid group think.  You actually articulated that one when we were first speaking?"
11D,11D_222,A,"Yeah absolutely, I reckon there’s absolutely attention there, and the board just needs to be mature to strike that balance, to say what’s the right level of, it’s not what’s the right level of diversity.  It’s like just getting the right person for the right time for the business, that’s where they're at."
11D,11D_223,Q,"I'm thinking also from what you've said, being able to be confident that you can manage it?  You’ve described how you build trust on the board, and you have a process of problem-solving that might go over a couple of meetings.  You must meet fairly regularly?"
11D,11D_224,A,"We meet in person every month, and then we have a call midmonth."
11D,11D_225,Q,"Okay, so that’s every fortnight you're in touch?"
11D,11D_226,A,"Every fortnight, yeah, we touch every fortnight."
11D,11D_227,Q,"So, your problem solving is really a continuous process then?"
11D,11D_228,A,"That’s right, yeah."
11D,11D_229,Q,"You're going to give me an example of your constitution, which might be part of the process, shape it.  Okay, so when you're selecting, so you're going to just be - I like this, it links with what you said about managing the tension between those two, depending on what situation the board’s in."
11D,11D_23,Q,"Diversity of views, okay, we will -"
11D,11D_230,A,"I think it takes courage for the board to appoint a new director, that has a significant amount of diversity.  Because they're effectively encouraging new perspectives, that may be uncomfortable in to the room."
11D,11D_231,Q,"But you seem to be comfortable with that discomfort, you actually want it?"
11D,11D_232,A,"Yeah, it is important.  What we’ve done in the business here, the same philosophy around teams, is we try and get as maximum diversity in a team.  When we don’t, we start - we just find that we don’t have high performance."
11D,11D_233,Q,"You will be cultivating the board, to be equally uncomfortable with lack of diversity?"
11D,11D_234,A,Yes.
11D,11D_235,Q,"That’ll be your strategy is it, as a chair?"
11D,11D_236,A,"It is, but I haven’t done it -"
11D,11D_237,Q,That will be one way -
11D,11D_238,A,"- but I have not done that with this board.  I mean I've only been there for eight months, but I also don’t think I've got the control to do that.  Because the people that are on it, the two founders and they're not going anywhere, and then the investor, and myself.  The big question is whether I'd invite someone else on to the board, and it just doesn’t seem to be a business need to do that."
11D,11D_239,Q,"It’s interesting, because you're so committed to it."
11D,11D_24,A,"Sorry not a view, not just a view, but diversity, like just generally different perspectives coming together."
11D,11D_240,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_241,Q,"The barriers, can you explain your barrier?"
11D,11D_242,A,What?  Barrier to what?
11D,11D_243,Q,To inviting another - some other person on?
11D,11D_244,A,Another person on the board?
11D,11D_245,Q,"Spell out these barriers, because it’ll be useful."
11D,11D_246,A,"The first would be that socialisation of the person, so I'd have to get - I'd have to build a case to my other board members, that we need to get another person on the board, for some reason or another.  Either we’re missing something already, in terms of the decisions or the way we operate, or the skillset, and I can't really make that case.  I'd also have pushback from the directors, the founders in particular, because they'd say that’s an unnecessary expense, to have another board member that we need to pay.  They’d just say I don’t see it being broken.  I think that for them, they are not as - they would prefer - they're not as in tune with what diversity brings, so I'd have to take them on the journey of this is what you get from a more diverse board, and getting someone else on.  They'd be like oh it’s probably just going to be a bit of a pain in the arse, so we’re good as we are."
11D,11D_247,Q,Where did you learn your appreciation of diversity?
11D,11D_248,A,"I think from the teams that I’ve been involved in, not the board, but the actual working teams to deliver product.  We build these teams here, and we really socially engineer them pretty thoughtfully, and have found that’s what’s helping us."
11D,11D_249,Q,"Right, now so that’s an IT background?"
11D,11D_25,Q,"Different perspectives, okay.  Do you think it's always - so how long were your start-up?"
11D,11D_250,A,"Yeah, they're basically small technology teams, each one has got about six or seven people."
11D,11D_251,Q,Small technology teams.
11D,11D_252,A,They build a product as an independent team.
11D,11D_253,Q,Is this?
11D,11D_254,A,Propel.
11D,11D_255,Q,"Oh, is Propel the work, it’s not Agile?"
11D,11D_256,A,"Oh, it’s Agile, yeah okay, that’s right."
11D,11D_257,Q,"Okay, got you."
11D,11D_258,A,"It's a small Agile team, an Agile team is sort of a certain way of working as a team."
11D,11D_259,Q,"Yes, I understand okay.  So that experience has really shown you, right."
11D,11D_26,A,So that was about 18 months.
11D,11D_260,A,Yeah that’s influenced me a lot.
11D,11D_261,Q,"Now these people, what age are they?"
11D,11D_262,A,They're all between about 25 and 35.
11D,11D_263,Q,On the board?
11D,11D_264,A,Oh no sorry.
11D,11D_265,Q,"On the board, sorry your board, back to your board?"
11D,11D_266,A,"On the board, the two founders are about 35, they're both about 35 and the investor is about 45, and I'm 43."
11D,11D_267,Q,Have they worked?
11D,11D_268,A,"They’ve never worked anywhere else, they started this business when they were about 22."
11D,11D_269,Q,"So, they haven't had the experience of small teams, let alone Agile?"
11D,11D_27,Q,18 months and now eight?
11D,11D_270,A,"No, they haven’t had any of that, they just run this one business for the last 13 years."
11D,11D_271,Q,"Wow, well we can’t rely on every board member having Agile experience to value diversity?"
11D,11D_272,A,No.
11D,11D_273,Q,"So, your perception of the barriers, can I have a quick understanding of that before we move to the last?"
11D,11D_274,A,The barriers to diversity?
11D,11D_275,Q,"From these guys?  The ones that don’t have the experience of Agile, I get yours, I understand you."
11D,11D_276,A,"Right, so why would they be against it?  They wouldn’t have seen the benefit of it, they would just see it as slowing us down."
11D,11D_277,Q,"Yeah, the inefficiencies and stuff?"
11D,11D_278,A,"The inefficiency, the cost and yeah, they wouldn’t see the benefit.  It’s interesting because they actually told me one day, who - when they were choosing between me and someone else, for the board role.  They told me who the other person was, and I know her quite well, very well.  She would have been fantastic and more diverse than me, and interestingly I'm probably a better board member for the first year, to put all this stuff in place.  She wouldn’t have been as good at that, but then going forward, she actually would be better for them than me, after that stuffs in place.  Because they need - and they probably chose me because I was less diverse, I was more like them."
11D,11D_279,Q,Their selection criteria?
11D,11D_28,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_280,A,Selection bias to me.
11D,11D_281,Q,"Yeah, you're amazing that you can just stand out and see yourself this way."
11D,11D_282,A,[Unclear] 00:55:59 that's a nice thing to say.
11D,11D_283,Q,"From a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted?  I don’t know if you were, like gender targets?"
11D,11D_284,A,"Yeah, I reckon it’s just pretty narrow and not - it’s not informing the world about what we’re really trying to achieve.  It’s made it in to - it’s made a more complex nuanced topic in to a sound bite, of we need more women in the board.  Then when there are women on the board, then people are throwing stones at it saying, yeah but they're all the same sort of women.  They're white 50-year-old women, and then they're actually - there’s a cadre of them or something.  The whole discussion is becoming - what’s the word?  It's like at a low level and it’s ignoring the high-level objective that we’re trying - that could be achieved."
11D,11D_285,Q,"Tokens, stereotypical?"
11D,11D_286,A,"Yeah, it’s becoming too token, that’s right."
11D,11D_287,Q,"Yeah, it's not really meaningful?"
11D,11D_288,A,"Like focusing it on gender has missed the point, so if - and I don’t know how we got to that point to be honest.  Because when you look, yeah, it’s a shame, because I think that anyway, but there’s a lot of really - I think being on boards, is such a fantastic way, particularly for really talented women, to contribute at a high level, without - and also be able to do whatever they want too else in their career.  It’s a really flexible thing to be able to do.  Yet it seems like not that open to females, yet at the same time we’re saying oh we need more females, but actually it's not so much about females and males, it's just about diversity more generally.  There should be more Aborigines and more like less well-off people and more Chinese people and whatever, it’s just different, different, different."
11D,11D_289,Q,"Do you think though, that the barriers to gender, to females, might, if they're managed it might open the way to other types of diversity?"
11D,11D_29,Q,"Do you feel that it’s always been important, diversity, like this important?"
11D,11D_290,A,"Yeah, I think so."
11D,11D_291,Q,"We can measure female, male fairly easily, reported."
11D,11D_292,A,"That’s a good point, it’s definitely a step towards diversity.  Yes, so probably the bluntest."
11D,11D_293,Q,"Absolutely, but you can count it."
11D,11D_294,A,"But it’s fine, you can count it."
11D,11D_295,Q,Do graphs and report it?
11D,11D_296,A,"Yeah, but that doesn’t help you, because you could get a female on the board that’s got the same sort of everything as me, cognitively, religiously, philosophically."
11D,11D_297,Q,And be a lawyer?
11D,11D_298,A,"And be a lawyer, and you get the same as me, so it doesn’t really help.  How do you - how would you then measure the level of diversity or divergence?  You might have to cover - it’s kind of interesting, people wouldn’t like it.  But if not personality profile, but something deeper than that, where you actually came up with all these different axis and said, in terms of libertarianism and like ethnicity and socioeconomic and religion.  You kind of just list out 15 different vectors of diversity and then map the board, and say here’s where we are.  You kind of say like a good board is a spread across these as possible.  That would be a - it would be pretty controversial, because particularly if a public company, you get these directors that then have to say, well I'm like a liberal voter or a labour voter, or I'm a vegetarian, or I'm pro this.  It would be kind of invasive.  But that’s probably the ultimate way of doing it."
11D,11D_299,Q,"Yeah, you're going real deep, like you're looking fundamentally at meta differences, values differences?"
11D,11D_3,Q,"Commerce, I thought it was commerce yeah, okay great.  That sort of can influence, you know we look at how that might influence."
11D,11D_30,A,It’s difficult for me to comment.
11D,11D_300,A,"Yeah, it’s got to be bigger than just gender."
11D,11D_301,Q,"I mean we could easily count religion though, we could have Muslim and Christian."
11D,11D_302,A,"Yeah, you could totally do that.  It would be interesting though, if you did that and you put the board of a publicly listed company up, and you chartered it.  It would be really controversial, because what you might find, is that on one axis, let’s say it’s like political persuasion, everyone's the same, and you're like ah.  Okay do we need to engineer this whole thing, so we actually have someone?  You’d be like okay, so I need to find a conservative female that’s also a lateral thinker, it would be interesting.  It would be - you'd end up, I don’t know if your hiring would be easier or harder?  It would be easier in some ways, because you just go, I just need someone who ticks all these boxes.  If you can prove to me that you're that profile, you've got a role on this board."
11D,11D_303,Q,Who does this?  Is it head hunters?  How do you find this out?
11D,11D_304,A,"I think it’s done at different levels, depending on the board.  So, for the start up type board that I'm on, it was the founders and the investor that did all of that.  I think it was the HR person in the company.  But for a publicly listed company, they’ve got the resources to just get a head hunter, and they'd say we need X, Y, Z."
11D,11D_305,Q,"Now 10 years in to the future, I had this line, creating tomorrows business, you've got up here, tomorrow’s boards, what are they going to look like do you think, in 10 years’ time?"
11D,11D_306,A,"If I think of the board of a publicly listed business, like AN IT COMPANY, I think that there’ll be more - I think the word is like accessible and egalitarian.  At the moment, when you look at, and AN IT COMPANYs not like this, they're actually more accessible and egalitarian than others.  But if you look at boards of other ASX listed companies, they're with sort of insiders.  I think that ideally the boards would be with higher performing people, that aren’t necessarily insiders.  The challenge with this, I had this when I was reporting to the AN IT COMPANY board, that the directors that were insiders, that understood the industry, were a lot easier to deal with then the directors that weren’t.  You kind of knew what you were getting, and there was more predictability, quicker ability to make decisions, understanding.  It was kind of easier with a board of what you would expect.  It’s pretty difficult to mount a case, or to get it over the line to say we need to have this board with much more different people.  Not industry insiders, much different perspectives, et cetera.  I wonder where it’ll settle?  The way that I've seen it work pretty well, is this coexistence where there’s a part of the board that represents diversity really well, and a part of the board that’s not that diverse, and able to run fast.  It’s kind of pragmatic."
11D,11D_307,Q,The sprinter?
11D,11D_308,A,"Yeah, when your board is a certain person, you can kind of do that, you can have three or four that are pretty similar, and then three or four that bring in the outside views.  I'm not sure in the future, whether the best boards will be ones that are all diverse or just have a diversity component.  But I do think that having outsiders, sends a strong signal, because it tells people that you don’t necessarily have to be someone that’s white with a law degree and in a certain socioeconomic bracket to be a board member.  Which I fear is the message right now.  We have to be a woman who’s 50 with a pearl necklace and earrings and coiffed hair.  There’s this image of the female board director."
11D,11D_309,Q,Stereotype.
11D,11D_31,Q,Because it’s pretty short?
11D,11D_310,A,"Stereotype, and it’s not right, that for me, it seems wrong.  Particularly for some of these businesses, the super funds and stuff like that.  I haven’t seen many of those boards, but the ones that I have seen, I just think why are you on that board?  What value are you bringing?"
11D,11D_311,Q,Who do you know?
11D,11D_312,A,"Yeah, it’s who do you know."
11D,11D_313,Q,"Possibly, I don’t know."
11D,11D_314,A,There’s that concern.
11D,11D_315,Q,"This is so interesting, thank you so much.  I've gone over the hour, sorry."
11D,11D_316,A,[Unclear] 01:06:10.
11D,11D_317,Q,"You're wonderful, it was really good Ben, really good."
11D,11D_318,A,"You're welcome, I'm glad it was useful."
11D,11D_319,A,[END PART A] [START PART B]
11D,11D_32,A,"It’s pretty short, but just generally speaking, I think that it hasn’t been as important, and now it’s becoming much more important.  There’s a recognition now."
11D,11D_320,Q,I don’t want to lose any of your thoughts.
11D,11D_321,A,"It gave me a lot to think about, and one of the things that I think I'll struggle with, coming out of this discussion, is that balance between speed and like efficiency and diversity."
11D,11D_322,Q,"Well I'll share this with you, yeah."
11D,11D_323,A,"I reckon that in the short-term there’s absolutely a trade off, and that’s difficult to work out, when to make that trade off."
11D,11D_324,Q,And long term its investment?
11D,11D_325,A,"Long term it’s an investment and you're going to get better outcomes.  You never know what you're missing out on.  You're like we’re okay aren’t we?  But there’s no parallel board that comes up with something.  I guess there is a parallel board and that’s your competitors.  If your competitors are making better decisions than you, that would evidence that your board’s not as high functioning as you think it is."
11D,11D_326,Q,Or the start up is a bit difficult isn't it?  Do you need help because you're?
11D,11D_327,A,"Well the nice thing, with our start up, we’re way ahead of the competitors in terms of how organised we are.  The others are just not that organised, so there’s nothing to compete against.  But if you're ASX listed, you’ve always got a couple of competitors, and it would be interesting to know.  It’s difficult then to work out though, is it - like if you're comparing one logistics company with another, is it the management that’s letting it down and the operational execution?  Or is it the board strategy?  Each one will just point fingers at each other, I guess."
11D,11D_328,Q,"Yeah.  What I came away with in terms of modelling, from what you've said, what’s coming to my head, is that let’s say complexity and opportunity or strategy, let’s say complexity and strategy, you’ve got up here.  Then you've got your board parts you spoke of, and you've got this sprinter part, which has got your insiders with insider knowledge.  But I remember, I just looked at something out there, and it’s about you always validate don’t you, was the term?"
11D,11D_329,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_33,Q,"Yeah, why do you think the investors felt that it was so important to get more diversity on the board?"
11D,11D_330,Q,"There’s validation, ongoing validation in that.  Then you’ve got your diversity path, which is outsiders and that’s a real problem, that’s problem solving, big picture stuff, isn't it?  This is problem solving, more focus perhaps with validation?  I don’t know, I don’t know."
11D,11D_331,A,"This is more execution focused, and then that’s more managing with it, and like risk."
11D,11D_332,Q,"I constructed that and that’s wrong.  Because you were thinking something else.  Your sprinter thinkers, are thinking quick, certain and go this far, then you check, go that far, then you check.  It’s short-term thinking, but cyclical?"
11D,11D_333,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_334,Q,"Whereas this is outside the square, seeing opportunities and risk, contributing to problem solving, and the trouble is they're two very different ways of problem solving.  How do they come together?"
11D,11D_335,A,"Yeah, so you put them in a board scenario and you're like you might have paralysis."
11D,11D_336,Q,You might.
11D,11D_337,A,"Because these people are going to slow them down, and I found that at AN IT COMPANY, that basically there was the board, and there’d be three board directors that totally get what you say, and you’d be like I've already made a decision.  Then the discussion would go for another 40 minutes while you're catching the others up.  They were very good about it, because they'd just be like okay, this is just the way it is.  But it was a two-speed board, you could see it."
11D,11D_338,Q,"Okay, well maybe there’s two different types of problems."
11D,11D_339,A,"I think that as a board member you've got to suck it up and sometimes it’s going to be a bit boring at that level, because it’s a two speed board, and some things you’ll be like, I sort of know this is the right decision, and this executive knows what they're doing.  Let’s just get it done.  I've got to wait for everyone else to just get on to the same page."
11D,11D_34,A,"I think it was particularly, in my situation, was because there’s two founders of the business, they invested in, so they had board seats, plus then the VC got a board seat, and then they agreed that they needed to just balance it out.  Just in terms of raw numbers and voting, was I think the primary - their primary concern actually.  It was more just mathematically making things less slanted towards the owners, like balancing things up.  It wasn't so much about diversity of opinion, and perspective, but then what’s happened subsequently, is that the founders have realised how valuable having a different perspective is.  There’s been a much greater value given to voicing differences - voicing different perspectives."
11D,11D_340,Q,"Yes, not every board member will be across every problem?"
11D,11D_341,A,That’s right.
11D,11D_342,Q,"But they will trust the sprint part of the board, recognising this is a sprinter question, and trust that they -"
11D,11D_343,A,"No, it wasn't like that, no, because the board members at that level, they're signing off on every."
11D,11D_344,Q,"Okay, so they won't do that, they won't trust parts of the board?"
11D,11D_345,A,"No, there’s no sprinter thing, it’s more like everyone needs to get - you need to invest the amount of time, to make sure that all board members are all aligned, and it just takes time.  Essentially you actually are sacrificing the efficiency of the board, for the quality of the board."
11D,11D_346,Q,The outcome?
11D,11D_347,A,"Yeah, and so that’s why I think sometimes at different phases of a business’s life cycle.  When AN IT COMPANY was private, its board was able to be insular type, not diverse of it.  Now it’s public and it’s taking public money, so they need to be more diverse and they get independence in, and it’s much slower, and that’s the price they pay."
11D,11D_348,Q,"Yeah, I haven’t got a model, I don’t know yet."
11D,11D_349,A,"Different strokes for different times, different folks is the answer."
11D,11D_35,Q,Can you give me an example?
11D,11D_350,Q,Yeah.
11D,11D_351,A,"That’s great, I'll be fascinated to see the outcome of the research that you're doing Margo."
11D,11D_36,A,"Yeah, so operationally the guys running the business, frequently have questions about how to run things, so recently one of them was even a small thing about car insurance.  At the moment, they're a relatively small business, and they said listen, we’re just thinking about continuing our car insurance with the current vendor.  But it’s actually what’s happening, is that all of the car insurances in one of the founder’s names, and not in the company name.  They said we just get a cheaper rate, rather than putting it in the company.  They knew that by coming up to the board, they'll get my view from legally, I was like legally that’s probably fine."
11D,11D_37,A,"But philosophically where the business is going, so you can’t do that, because like you're obeying the letter of the law but not the spirit.  They were able to see what a legalistic answer was and what a financial answer was, and what a pragmatic answer was.  They really valued coming at it from different perspectives.  So, Chris, one of the other independent director, he said listen, from a business perspective that's fine, you're saving money.  Then I was able to come at it from a legal perspective."
11D,11D_38,Q,"Okay, good, so it helps problem solving?"
11D,11D_39,A,"It helps problem solving, yeah."
11D,11D_4,A,"Yeah, that actually is influence I'd say."
11D,11D_40,Q,"What about strategy, do you think?"
11D,11D_41,A,"Yeah, so I wear a couple of different hats, because I've previously worked at Boston Consulting Group, where I learned a lot about strategy.  Percentually this business is very operationally intense, so they need help with operations, finance, strategy and culture, they're probably the main pieces.  We have questions around those areas, at most board meetings.  The founders don’t have much experience with any of the others, except for operational.  So, they lean on the board for like my view around strategy, Chris’s view around finance, my view around culture.  We all come at it with a different angle."
11D,11D_42,Q,"Great, okay, that’s good.  Do you think that there’s any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating?  For example, high uncertainty or risk?  I was noticing this is your area of working, you love this climate?  As an entrepreneur, so you're the perfect person.  Does diversity help or hinder, and can you give me an example?"
11D,11D_43,A,"I can't see a circumstance by which you would want less diversity on a board, or even in a workplace.  I think you're just exposing yourself to more risk, when you've got less diversity.  If that’s the case, if you've got a particularly low risk environment, you could afford to have a lower, a less diverse board, that probably makes sense?  If the stakes are low, then you probably don’t really need it so much."
11D,11D_44,Q,"Okay, so it really comes in to its own, when there’s risk and uncertainty?"
11D,11D_45,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_46,Q,Can you give me an example?  Of how diversity helps there?
11D,11D_47,A,"Yeah, so in a high stake’s environment, where there’s lots of money or lots of employees at risk, or yeah, then you just need to be able to, as a director, understand as many of the different angles as possible, so you can make the best decision.  With less diversity, you're going to hear less angles, to think about."
11D,11D_48,Q,"Okay, so really the diverse board, can better manage the complexity or the many facets, that contribute to this -"
11D,11D_49,A,To the risk.
11D,11D_5,Q,"Yeah, great.  Okay, so how many years have you been a Board Director?"
11D,11D_50,Q,to this risk?
11D,11D_51,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_52,Q,And to its management?
11D,11D_53,A,Yeah.
11D,11D_54,Q,"Okay, beautiful, so now we’ve got risk and complexity is better with this diversity.  That hasn’t come up before, it’s neat.  Gender diversity has been debated for a while, how do you feel about the recent inclusion of other sorts of ethnicity, such as sexual orientation?"
11D,11D_55,A,"Yeah, I think gender diversity is only one angle of diversity, and actually sometimes by focusing on gender diversity, you might achieve gender diversity, but actually not actually achieve diversity across a whole lot of other vectors.  We actually just had this, like a couple of hours ago, where we’re choosing an employee to hire.  We have like a female of Russian descent, a female of Indian descent, and a male of - like a New Zealander.  We were like okay, so how is having a female actually different, like if we choose between the females, what sort of different diversity are we going to get between them?"
11D,11D_56,A,"We’re able to identify well, one of them who’s Indian is actually not diverse compared to the rest of the team.  Because most of the rest of the team are Indian actually, but the Russian lady actually, you get both cultural and gender with her.  We were discussing how many different vectors of difference diversity can you get outside of just culture and discipline and gender.  Gender really just counts for one of many characteristics.  You might get off gender, so you have a female, but if the female’s actually an Indian and everyone else is Indian, or they have the same sort of political persuasion as everyone else, you're kind of not getting much benefit for the diversity."
11D,11D_57,Q,"This is great, okay, so do you think there’s a particular kind of diversity that matters more than others?  Or does it depend?"
11D,11D_58,A,"I think I'm not mature enough to see different angles of diversity count for more than others.  I think that what happens is in certain circumstances, a type of diversity becomes more important.  I've been in situations where just having one female in the room, really has a big impact.  In other circumstances, it might be not gender diversity that we need, it’s probably socioeconomic diversity that’s more impactful.  I think that it depends, is the answer for that one."
11D,11D_59,Q,"You have so many different understandings of diversity, it’s so good, you have mentioned, I don't know they'll be counted up when we do your transcript.  It’s great.  Really good.  I won't challenge you to list them, don’t worry."
11D,11D_6,A,"So, I've been a Non-Exec Director of this, a company that’s not my own, for only eight months."
11D,11D_60,A,Yeah sure.
11D,11D_61,Q,"We want to understand how diversity influences board functioning.  Are there particular board functions that diversity can really help with, and can you give me an example?  Now you've given me one around problem solving, is there another one you can give me, perhaps from your business that you were in for about 18 months?  That you were the director of for about 18 months?"
11D,11D_62,A,"Yeah, so how does diversity influence decisions, is it influence with -"
11D,11D_63,Q,"Yeah, board functioning and you can talk about the other one too, because it’s not just problem solving."
11D,11D_64,A,"So, there's a couple of things.  I think it can - when there’s more views expressed, it forces people to address those views, so that there’s less comfort.  What happens is that in a healthy environment, you're trying to actually surface up the conflicts, because the conflict is already there.  But unless it’s stirred, you're not going to see it.  I think that diversity helps you to actually surface things that would otherwise go unspoken or unsaid, and then unaddressed and then missed, and then you get risk.  I think that’s the main thing that the board functioning that you see it.  It’s just, it probably feels less comfortable, which is the answer actually."
11D,11D_65,Q,You have to feel uncomfortable?
11D,11D_66,A,"Yeah, when you're feeling uncomfortable, because someone’s said something that you think oh,I haven’t thought of that, or I don’t agree with that, then you're probably on to something."
11D,11D_67,Q,"Can you give me an example, do you reckon?  It just really helps?"
11D,11D_68,A,"Yeah, so I'm not - this isn't in a board context, but in another group that I'm involved with.  I'm frequently finding that there’s a female in that group, and when she expresses her view, I'm constantly like I hadn’t even - that wasn’t even a thing that I was thinking about in that scenario.  She’s able to like - so she’s raising things that I would have otherwise missed, I think that’s the first bit.  Then sometimes she’ll also say things that I completely disagree with, but a day later I'm like, you know it’s grown on me, and now I think you might be right.  What’s an example of when Anna’s done that?  Oh I can't remember a specific example at the moment, it’s been a couple of months since she’s been in those meetings.  Yeah, I'll have to come back to that."
11D,11D_69,Q,Has she left those meetings because of this conflict?
11D,11D_7,Q,"Right, so eight months, so you're an independent?"
11D,11D_70,A,"No, no, and we actively like I'm now wondering whether it’s because she’s a female and the rest of us are male, or whether it's just a personality thing that could be replaced with another person.  I also personally think that when you get too many guys in a room, it just becomes a bit macho, and it’s like kind of unavoidable.  A female actually holds them to account, so that’s like only one type of diversity naturally.  But it probably happens, again talking about different vectors, socioeconomically, there’s just a whole lot of people of the same socioeconomic, they all start talking about you know, their Ferraris or something.  It’s just so it holds you to account, where there’s someone that’s different.  You’ll be more careful, probably more thoughtful about what you would say."
11D,11D_71,A,"Which actually, now that I say it, could have a detrimental impact on a board environment.  Because if you're scared about offending other board members, then you may clam up a bit.  That probably suggests that diversity on its own, it’s a precondition for success.  It’s necessary but it’s not sufficient, because if you haven’t got the environment by which all views are then respected and able to be voiced, then you can be as diverse as you want, but you're not going to achieve the positive outcome you're looking for."
11D,11D_72,Q,"Not voicing is a barrier, and voicing is a lever.  This is probably, what makes the difference?"
11D,11D_73,A,"Yeah you need the diversity, but if they don’t have the ability to voice their true self in that environment, you might as well not have the diversity in the first place."
11D,11D_74,Q,How do you get that ability?  How do you build that ability for everyone to voice?
11D,11D_75,A,"Well so the way we’ve done it in our board meetings, for Detector Inspector, is we shared our - we tried to create a deep sense of trust between us as board members.  One of the ways, like there's a whole lot of ways of doing that.  One of the ways we’ve done it, is to share one thing we call our journey line, which is sort of our past history since a kid.  This is who I am and this is where I've come from, and this is why I've made decisions like I do.  We did this and I lived there and I'm a middle child and blah blah blah.  We do that there as well actually.  But I think in arenas where you’re not fostering a deep level of trust, people aren’t going to actually be open and bring their perspective."
11D,11D_76,Q,"Wow, no one has talked about that.  Has this come from your culture?  You mentioned that you were brought on to the board because of your strength in culture as well, in culture management?"
11D,11D_77,A,"So, I think that they got lucky.  In terms of choosing me for that board.  I think they looked at me and thought, like the decision makers weren’t necessarily looking for diversity.  They were looking for diversity in terms of numbers and votes, as I was saying.  So there’ll be another person, and they looked at me and I thought, I think that the two founders of that business looked at me and thought I can kind of relate to this person.  Again, they're probably not looking for diversity, here's another guy -"
11D,11D_78,Q,You're not female?
11D,11D_79,A,"Yeah, it’s like another guy, I sort of understand him, he kind of looks kind of normal, there’s people like that in my neighbourhood, you know.  If I had purple hair and different socioeconomic and like different gender and different political, they probably would be like nah.  So, they would have been nah.  In fact, I think I was actually chosen based on my lack of diversity, when I come to think of it."
11D,11D_8,A,"Yeah, I'm an independent director on that board."
11D,11D_80,Q,"Isn't that funny, that’ll come up in board selection, but you can think about othersituations, so that’s funny.  They got lucky from your point of view, but they were probably challenged when your comfort with conflict, and this trust building exercise -"
11D,11D_81,A,"Oh, we’re on a journey with those folks, the first argument we had, it was challenging for them, they weren’t used to having anyone else in their business actually.  So, they were really threatened."
11D,11D_82,Q,"So, it’s you and someone else?"
11D,11D_83,A,Me and a big investor and then the two founders.
11D,11D_84,Q,"Okay, so you and the investor sort of got together, well when I say you sort of worked together to challenge there?"
11D,11D_85,A,"Yes, that’s exactly the dynamic."
11D,11D_86,Q,That’s a bit of a social rift in the board?
11D,11D_87,A,"There absolutely is, because there’s like the founders, the founder owners and then the outsiders, and so there’s definitely a rift, not a rift, we’re pretty high functioning.  But there’s definitely a line drawn down the table."
11D,11D_88,Q,"Yes, but you've got the power of the investor that investor is -"
11D,11D_89,A,"Not necessarily, I'm independent, so I don’t have, but I'm chair as well, so if there is a two two split, then my vote carries."
11D,11D_9,Q,"Okay good.  You’ve got this one, is it for profit?"
11D,11D_90,Q,"Okay, I was thinking, so it’s great you're a chair, thanks for letting me know that, because a lot of people talk about, oh the chair is central and it’s hard to get chairs.  So how you manage it.  But I was just thinking, I suppose the clout of the investor means they have to hang in there and stick with this idea of a board?"
11D,11D_91,A,"Well they can't get rid of the board, once I'm appointed now, I can't remember how it is that they can - I think that all three of them actually need to vote to get me off."
11D,11D_92,Q,"Right, there’s a constitution?"
11D,11D_93,A,"Yeah, there’s a constitution and as part of that, it's quite difficult to remove me as a director."
11D,11D_94,Q,"Yeah, I don’t mean you personally."
11D,11D_95,A,"Yeah well anyone, whoever was in that non-executive director role, once it’s been filled, I think you need 75 per cent of the votes or something to remove it."
11D,11D_96,Q,"Okay, brilliant."
11D,11D_97,A,"That’s correct actually, so the two founders, if they really didn’t want me on the board, they can’t themselves vote me off."
11D,11D_98,Q,"Yeah, so there's -"
11D,11D_99,A,There’s protection.
12D correcte,12D correcte_1,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_10,Q,Are you the only young one? Are they all sort of my age or your parents’ age?
12D correcte,12D correcte_100,Q,"This is a really wonderful story. And I mean you probably think of it just as a personal story, but I can see some strategies that could help other people to follow in your amazing trajectory. So you know it's really good. Now I'm conscious of the time, and I want us to get some of these questions that I ask other people."
12D correcte,12D correcte_101,A,"Yeah of course. Sorry, I'm rambling a bit."
12D correcte,12D correcte_102,Q,"No, no, no, that was brilliant by the way. That was brilliant. This sort of information you gave there will work beautifully with some theory that will help us a lot, so don't think you rambled."
12D correcte,12D correcte_103,A,[unclear] 00:36:22
12D correcte,12D correcte_104,Q,"Yeah exactly. So how important do you think it is to have a diverse board? Let's say I give you a scale one to 10, 10 is extremely important and one is not at all important, what would you say?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_105,A,Well surely it's got to be a nine or 10. Should I qualify that?
12D correcte,12D correcte_106,Q,"You tell me which one. And then yes, then I will ask you to qualify it."
12D correcte,12D correcte_107,A,"I'm going to say nine. The reason being that, and this is perhaps the somewhat controversial opinion, diversity is important in that it needs at the very least it should reflect the community which you're serving regardless of whether it's corporate or not for profits. If you don't have the points of view purely from a business perspective, if you don't have the points of the view of people that you're serving then it's surely not going to deliver the best outcomes. Further to that, where people make the argument that the board – you know potentially if an argument is that the demographic for our product or service is not particularly diverse, we don't really need a diverse board for that reason, then my argument would always be well this is what your business does now and this is who your business serves now, but you always need to be evolving as an organisation and perhaps having a different point of view around the table will help you see where that next opportunity is or the risk to your business that you can't comprehend. So it is incredibly important, but I don't know that in my own personal life, I don't know that I would want to be – no one wants to be the token. So, if I felt like I'd been appointed or there was a chance of being appointed purely for being a token, then it does a lot of discredit both to that individual and to the organisation I think."
12D correcte,12D correcte_108,Q,Can you explain that a little more?
12D correcte,12D correcte_109,A,"And this is not in the context of my board experience but in the context of work, I felt like at times maybe I was put in certain positions because I was young, of migrant backgrounds and female. And I had to work that much harder to prove myself, which absolutely – and people talk about this all the time, that much harder to prove myself but which I could do to the immediate team with which I worked. But beyond that there's very little opportunity to demonstrate your value. And people – at the end of the day when you move on to another role, it's not going to be the six people you directly work with and it might be their connections that help you in. But if the wider team of 50 all has a perspective and view that it's very difficult to shift without having an opportunity to interact with them, then it just makes future opportunities that much more difficult as well."
12D correcte,12D correcte_11,A,"I think many of them either have children, have daughters at the school or recent leavers. So most of them are still working, we've got a few who are now partially retired, who are  doing a lot of governance work involved. So I'd certainly say that I'm younger than – well I am younger than all of the other board members. My experience coming into the role was that –and I'm not sure if this unnecessary background but hopefully it helps. I had decided that I wanted to be involved with boards quite early on in my own personal professional life. So when I was at university the idea of a board level or a directorship career was sort of brought to my attention for the first time, and I didn't think too much of it but I had met particularly some board members involved with THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL  at that time who were very inspirational women mostly. Who I then, in a roundabout way, I then went to work in banking and in working with some of my clients which were all sort of institutional and clients. Some of these names were quite familiar because they had been board members at THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL  and now were on various Australian corporate boards. So it was inspirational to see these women who very loosely had a personal connection through, to see them really at the top of their industries, sitting in various corporate board roles."
12D correcte,12D correcte_110,Q,"Beautiful. Okay. So you lose a strategic opportunity for yourself, opportunity for yourself if you're token and it doesn't feel very nice either. And you work really hard for very little gain."
12D correcte,12D correcte_111,A,"Yeah. Like if there's an option between going to go into a board that said, “We'd love to have you involved because of x y z reasons” and they can clearly articulate them, and I feel like I can deliver into that, versus a board that can't do that and, for whatever reason, makes me feel like they might be just checking a box, then of course I'll choose the one that can articulate their values."
12D correcte,12D correcte_112,Q,"What percentage of women are on your board, the THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_113,A,I should know off the top of my head but I don't. But it's certainly the majority.
12D correcte,12D correcte_114,Q,"That’s good. It is a females [unclear] 00:40:37 – just to test your theory earlier. That’s great, okay, good. Do you think that there's any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating of to diversity. High uncertainty, high risk situations, something like that maybe?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_115,A,"That's an interesting question. No, because I think the high risk question is really interesting because well anecdotally and from what I've read, men tend to be more risk taking, so I'm sure there's hypothesis there about a board with a higher risk appetite doing things differently. But if it's diverse then there should be a balance between those who are willing to take risks and those who are a little less likely to. So hopefully not, no."
12D correcte,12D correcte_116,Q,"Yeah okay, that's good. And what now does diversity – you mentioned earlier, but what does it mean to you, what does board diversity mean to you?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_117,A,"It means having people around the table that bring different perspectives. And there is no way you can cover all of them, but you can certainly try."
12D correcte,12D correcte_118,Q,"Some people talk about gender, so demographic diversity, gender, age, ethnicity those things you can measure and see. Functional, like your experience, your experience in the bank, your experience at THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL , your experience as a young woman who has gone through THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL  and is engaging in the workforce. So you talked about those experiences and how that was really important. So –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_119,A,"Well I think it just the way the boards are structured now, at the bare minimum, the board needs to be diverse enough to cover off and discharge its duties as a board. So you need to have the technical and requisite skill sets around that board table. That's the baseline. And then further to that, the ability to bring different perspectives. And this is the thing, it doesn't necessarily need to be – lived experience is one way to get it but it doesn't need to be someone who is – like a perfect example is, I speak often about elements of Chinese culture. I'm not Chinese, I've never grown up there, and yet I can speak to – in that setting, I have the most relevant experience to be able to speak to it. And so it's not necessarily about being fully representative of that community, which I acknowledge and own that I'm not. But just to have a different perspective to the other board members is a place to start."
12D correcte,12D correcte_12,A,"So that was a back of my mind inspiration, but on a practical sense I had always been really interested in volunteering but had found over the years that I really wanted to be doing more skilled volunteering. So, I'd sort of graduated from doorknocking, which is hugely important, to helping with providing analysis or strategic advice or different pieces of, as they say, skilled volunteering. A few years into my corporate career an opportunity came up through just some informal networks, a girl that I had mentored in a way during my university years had been a very active volunteer with A YOUTH ORGANISATION Victoria and she'd found out that they were looking for young advisers to their board and put my name forward and I had a few conversations with them, went through an interview process and eventually joined their board in an advisory capacity. So not as a director."
12D correcte,12D correcte_120,A,"Because you know you've got a board with 10 seats around the table, there's no way you can capture every perspective of whether it's a young woman or young man or someone who's gone through school and had to deal with the challenges of figuring out their sexuality or whatever it is, you know well-being in schools is a huge issue now. So pastoral care experience, with I think the THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD board is fantastic in that we've got adolescent psychologists on the board, we've got educators, we've got accountants and lawyers. So it’s, from a skills perspective, very diverse. From a representation a representation of our community it's also very diverse in that we've got parents, ex-students and we’ve had benefactors in the past so most of the community is represented on the board as well."
12D correcte,12D correcte_121,A,"But as to whether it's ticking off a certain demographic or not, whether it's, “Okay we need one person between the age of 18 and 26, and one person between the age of 26 and 35” that seems a bit arbitrary to me. But perhaps it's the only way to achieve it because how else would you – I think that setting benchmarks has to be quantifiable, so perhaps that's a way to do it."
12D correcte,12D correcte_122,Q,"We'll get on to regulation towards the end, so that’s good. Do you feel that there's a particular kind of diversity that matters more than others or does it depend always, like you’ve mentioned?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_123,A,Do I think that different types of diversity matter –
12D correcte,12D correcte_124,Q,More than others.
12D correcte,12D correcte_125,A,-@more than others?
12D correcte,12D correcte_126,Q,And then would you vary your ranking depending on the situation or context?
12D correcte,12D correcte_127,A,"I think sometimes it's very helpful. And I don't know if the board room as appropriate for it but maybe that's the only place for this conversation to happen. But I think that it's really useful to have someone in the room that can almost play the devil's advocate. Because that's the ultimate demonstration of not having groupthink. As to whether it's diversity, I don't know. But having someone in the room who says, “But what about this” or considering something on the flip side, at the very least encourages quite a robust debate. But it's not the same thing as diversity, where I think diversity is almost instead of flipping something on its head, diversity is adding to the conversation by pulling in different points of view. I think maybe I haven't had enough practical experience, but maybe on boards there have been people who've played that role who are quite contrarian, and so they can have these robust discussions. But they might not be bringing in different points of view. I'm not sure if that makes sense."
12D correcte,12D correcte_128,Q,The devil's advocate role is not necessarily –
12D correcte,12D correcte_129,A,It’s not the same –
12D correcte,12D correcte_13,Q,"Which board was that, YM –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_130,Q,"- the same as diversity. Well this is a good time to ask about, to think about – there's been a lot of talk about cognitive diversity, and what I'm thinking about here is different approaches to problem solving and different perspectives or different information processing styles. So this is sort of as close as I can think of to your devil's advocate role. So do you feel that cognitive diversity influences your board's functioning, and is this a positive or negative influence, or does it depend?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_131,A,So I should say that my line of work is in developing experiences that test the teams and individuals based on different cognitive styles. So this is my –
12D correcte,12D correcte_132,Q,Oh fantastic.
12D correcte,12D correcte_133,A,"Yes, this is my bread and butter."
12D correcte,12D correcte_134,Q,"So do you use that term, cognitive diversity?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_135,A,"I don’t, but I will from now on. No, we speak to a very – I guess we use very layman terms and we deal actually with corporates in a quite relaxed setting. So it's just about talking about different thinking styles. I have not thought about it strictly within – like when I'm sitting in the boardroom, I don't know that I think about it very consciously. I know that there are other – so there's quite a difference in experience in the THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD boardroom in terms of governance. So there are some, and I mean you spoke to a director who's incredibly experienced and an amazing individual. He will make references in the boardroom to specific theories around cognitive style. So he might say, “Okay, to put on the black hat for a moment” and pose a question. So I would think that there are members in that room who are certainly more conscious of it than others in the role that they're playing in the boardroom. I think that we've sort of spoken about it that there’s certainly particularly the black hats, I guess. I can't remember all of them, but blue ocean thinking as well, having that person who throws out the more faraway concepts. Yeah, I certainly think that there’s incredible value to having different cognitive styles in the room, and that goes for any team, not just the boardroom. As to how well every board manages to assess that, harder to tell."
12D correcte,12D correcte_136,Q,"Yes. To assess it as “this individual will contribute x, this one y” or “how do we assess its functioning on our board” –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_137,A,",Yes it's probably two parts. I don't think it's particularly well assessed. I think technical skill sets are very well assessed, as is experience. I don't think that different cognitive styles are considered as much but it might just be because the board, this is my experience, the board functions in quite a structured way and there's not actually a lot of – there isn't necessarily, I can't think of a way, there isn't necessarily a lot of flexibility to accommodate for maximising the benefits of different cognitive styles. So everybody brings what they can to the table but you've got two hours of a board meeting, six to eight times a year. There isn't a huge amount of time to say, “Okay well, this is your style and this is the way it will work best with the other board members and management. And this is the way we're going to structure our meetings so that we can make the most of each of these things”, especially when each meeting deals with such different content. It might be difficult to capitalise on that, but it's certainly important to have just in terms of having a discussion, that there are different thinking styles around the table so that someone can play devil's advocate or someone can throughout be, “Have we considered this?”"
12D correcte,12D correcte_138,Q,"Okay so it contributes to functioning and so it's really important, but it seems to be hard to assess and measure, so to control or manage?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_139,A,"Yeah difficult to assess measure, and also capitalise on to its maximum benefit. Which makes measuring it less important. Which is if we can't –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_14,A,A YOUTH ORGANISATION Victoria.
12D correcte,12D correcte_140,Q,Capitalise on it –
12D correcte,12D correcte_141,A,"- do a lot with it, it's like, “Okay we know this about our members but we don't have a lot of flexibility to be able to make much of it.”"
12D correcte,12D correcte_142,Q,So the inflexibility comes from people not being able to – or you haven't got the time?
12D correcte,12D correcte_143,A,"I think it's a question of time. Because you don't want to limit people in the context of a discussion to say, “Well this is your thinking style and this is how you're going to contribute to the boardroom.” I mean we could go through the exercise and be conscious of how each person thinks, but you also wouldn't want people to fall into specific roles, “Okay it's my responsibility to say only these things.” So I don't know if making every board member – there’d have to be a fine management of making board members aware and then also making use of it in some productive way, which I feel like there isn't a lot of time to do well and that there may be more inherent risks. So well, that person's always going to play this role or –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_144,Q,Pigeon holding people.
12D correcte,12D correcte_145,A,Yeah.
12D correcte,12D correcte_146,Q,"That’s interesting, I'll look into that through some more interviews. It's an interesting idea. So, now I'd like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards, and if so, how such a conflict can be managed. Can you remember a decision, can you recall a decision that the board needed to make which involved conflict, and you think diversity of some kind had a role in this?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_147,A,"I'm sure there is some. Well I think it's natural that conflicts will arise when two people have different points of view. As to whether that needs to be a bad thing or not, or if I can even recall a time where it's had any – I feel like it just results in a robust discussion, and typically it gets voted on if there is a lack of consensus, obviously it will get voted on. If it's very split still, typically it goes to further investigation and that will come back to the next board meeting. So I think –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_148,Q,"Can you remember one where it went to, “Okay more research is needed and then we will come back”, do you remember one of those?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_149,A,"Hard to say whether this research was going to happen already or not, but we discussed basically demographics in Melbourne and where young people, so graduates from the school who are about my age, their late 20s early 30s, where would they typically moving to? And there was a hypothesis, and then I just sort of looked at my peers and said, “Okay well this is where they all live.” Yeah absolutely, they may have grown up in these suburbs but they now all moved here and there was some disagreement about whether that was true. That was absolutely fair enough because it was very anecdotal evidence so further research was undertaken to decide what accurately reflected the demographics we were looking at. So, I think when it's anecdotal evidence, then I feel like it's perfectly justified to disagree with it."
12D correcte,12D correcte_15,Q,What does it stand for?
12D correcte,12D correcte_150,Q,"So that's a question of fact. What about values, have there ever been any conflict over perhaps something with a value base? I mean I'm also conscious that you've been on the board for 16 months, you know, I've been asking this question of people who've been on for 10 years and could be the reasons [unclear] 00:56:42. So it doesn't matter if you can't think of one."
12D correcte,12D correcte_151,A,"Yeah, so values. I don't think I've ever, and this is where I've been involved in a conflict, I don't think I've ever raised anything that didn't have practical implications. So I don't think I've ever raised some kind of value judgment or perspective that didn't have practical implications on what the board was discussing. So, then it becomes very much discussion about the practicalities of action or inaction, as opposed to necessarily a question –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_152,Q,Whether you should do it or not –
12D correcte,12D correcte_153,A,Yeah.
12D correcte,12D correcte_154,Q,morally.
12D correcte,12D correcte_155,A,Yeah morally as a question.
12D correcte,12D correcte_156,Q,"Is that because of the culture, the strong cultural norm of the board do you think?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_157,A,"As my only experience, it’s hard to compare to anything."
12D correcte,12D correcte_158,Q,But you seem to all agree fundamentally about this –
12D correcte,12D correcte_159,A,"Yeah, well I don't think that it's particularly – tolerant is not the right word, but I don't think it's the norm for any board member to put forward a comment which doesn't have some basis or support which we can then unpack. So, you can't just voice an opinion and have nothing to –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_16,A,"Young Men's Christian Association, but I don't think they particularly affiliate with anything like that anymore. But they run a huge portfolio of community and social services. So that was a really interesting organisation to be involved with for a while, just to see the breadth of their operations and to get an understanding of – I mean that was the first exposure I had to a board. So I sat in on some of the subcommittee meetings. I wasn't a board member so I wasn't in board meetings but the relevant subcommittee meetings I would attend. And just the process of how boards are run and the distinction between management and the board et cetera, et cetera, was a really interesting experience further to being able to feel like I was contributing to their organisation."
12D correcte,12D correcte_160,Q,Substantiate it.
12D correcte,12D correcte_161,A,"- substantiate it or qualify it, which can then be discussed and unpacked. So maybe it's just a matter of – and I also think when there's only two hours you don't have time to entertain those types of opinions and thoughts, so I don't think people raise concerns that they aren't able to substantiate."
12D correcte,12D correcte_162,Q,"Yeah, I guess it might be something about whether THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL  should target some high achieving people from a low socio economic background and give them scholarships or something, and so that's a really a values question, it’s not a question of fact."
12D correcte,12D correcte_163,A,"Yeah, that maybe it’s a question of – maybe the answer is just that the board is quite agreed on values."
12D correcte,12D correcte_164,Q,"Exactly, that’s what I'm thinking. And you’ve not been there for that long, like in the future there might be some strategic decision where this kind of – not that particular situation but something else. But that's good. And a final question, now you've talked about that and I really like the way you talked about that, this is about identifying new members. They did consider ways to increase diversity. They had as a matrix, but it came up as the measurable ones, demographics, we have no one who matches our student clientele or the –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_165,A,"I think in the past, and I was not privy to those conversations having taken place before I joined. But in the past a lot of those concerns had been there was a demographer on the board. So I think some of those concerns had been alleviated by having someone who was able to comment from a technical point of view on that demographic. And then I think there was some discussion – so he left, and I think there was some discussion about how they then fill that knowledge gap, and the obvious thing was to simply go for someone who had been a student at the school, best case scenario, who had been to the school and was a young person who had some kind of skills to bring the board. And so I think it was just right place right time for me, and something that they were looking for."
12D correcte,12D correcte_166,Q,"Okay. So it was because so a particular person on the board had a particular skill, it wasn't because of a generic tool they used that they realised, “oh gee we need someone, representative” –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_167,A,"Yeah, well, I think they’d gone through their [unclear] 01:01:07 exercise, and I don't know if it was – it's hard to quantify that. But I know through informal discussions that that had been a concern. And they'd relied on his input for certain conversations and not having him around, they definitely – probably from a cultural point of view they just felt like they needed someone who could contribute in that way."
12D correcte,12D correcte_168,Q,"Have they put on anyone – are you seeking someone else for your board, so you're seeing this process unfold or?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_169,A,So he left before I joined. I kind of stepped into –
12D correcte,12D correcte_17,Q,And who chaired that subcommittee?
12D correcte,12D correcte_170,Q,His shoes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_171,A,"his shoes, I guess, in some ways. Couldn't make up for it in many other ways. The process hasn't changed in that we – a new director has just been appointed and he again fills a very specific skills gap that the board believed would be necessary in the medium term."
12D correcte,12D correcte_172,Q,"Did someone, like a recruitment organisation or someone help them analyse and identify the gap or do they do it themselves?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_173,A,"I believe it's internally complete, so there's a self-valuation of the board and I'm sure it gets benchmarked."
12D correcte,12D correcte_174,Q,Like a subcommittee.
12D correcte,12D correcte_175,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_176,Q,"So do you think your board has any barriers to managing or building its diversity? And if so, what would that be?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_177,A,"The obvious thing is if they want more young board members, it's simply not that many young people that put their names forward."
12D correcte,12D correcte_178,Q,And why is that?
12D correcte,12D correcte_179,A,"I don't think it’s specific to THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD, that's the first thing. I think it's quite representative of all boards. I think that is probably because a board has been seen as a place where you go when you've reached the pinnacle of your career and you can then contribute substantially in a much more condensed period of time to an organisation. Perhaps it comes to an understanding of what the board's role is in an organisation. And so, many boards that will probably still be the case, that we need people who are not just at the peak of their own careers but leading the industries to be involved with our organisations at the board level. Insofar as that continues to be the case, it's very unlikely that young people will be able to take a seat at the table because there’s no substitution for 40 years of experience if that's what the board wants. For other boards where they see a value in the board room for strategic conversation – and I think boards have dealt with this in different ways in that they get management to complete or get consultants to complete piece of research, would then get circulated to the board for decision. But yeah, as to whether the lived experience is helpful in the context of the board discussion, who knows. I think the jury's kind of out, like it could be you know often you have guests, they come in and speak on certain items, so do they need to be directors?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_18,A,An experienced director
12D correcte,12D correcte_180,Q,"Yeah, like you were on an advisory for a board for example. But I guess I'm interested the barriers for you. You talked about the image of the board. What it’s seen to be, it's for people at the end of their career as when they can bring it all together and whatever. If that's the image of what it is to be a board member that young people have, what happens when they see you and they hear someone like you? Do you think that will challenge that understanding?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_181,A,"Completely different reference, have you ever heard of Malcolm Gladwell’s, what does he call that, Pioneers and Pariahs or something, great read, you should read it."
12D correcte,12D correcte_182,Q,I’ll write it down.
12D correcte,12D correcte_183,A,"It’s really relevant to this discussion because he talks about different examples where sometimes one person can open the door and lots of people follow them because they’ve now seen the example. There's often times where one person gets appointed into a role and then no one again for a really long time. And so, it's not necessarily about the first person, it's really about reading reaching some kind of tipping point around representation. So, absolutely for a few people maybe it will resonate, my story will resonate with them and they'll think that this is a possible option for me. But for a lot of people it won't still think that that experience is purely my own and that there's no way to replicate it. It's not a situation that they perceive as accessible to themselves until a point in time when there's lots of us. I don't think that that will change. And that's my reflection built upon conversations that I've had. So I don't think people here, “Oh you're a board member with this school” I think a lot of people are aware of it, more people than I would expect to be aware of it, but I don't think that they think that that means something for them. And you know it is probably still an element of tall poppy where they look at me and say, “Oh well she thinks that she can do these things” and whether they – and lots of people supportive but not everybody is. So I hope that it inspires people to try but it doesn't seem like that's what the impact is most of the time."
12D correcte,12D correcte_184,Q,"So would you be invited to talk at THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL  to students so they can see, “Oh look there's a young board member”?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_185,A,"Yeah, on occasion. I think that's really important. So it's really important for our community, as to how much that resonates across a wider, across the education system or the not for profit sector or even in general."
12D correcte,12D correcte_186,Q,Fashion for example.
12D correcte,12D correcte_187,A,"Yeah, exactly. And I think as well the fact that it makes so much sense from our board's perspective that I am a past student of this school. Makes it seem a lot less relevant to every other organisation, because like well okay she's on that board because she had the lived experience of going to that school and now she participates in the board. Where it would be different I think if it was a position with a comparable institution that I had no affiliation with."
12D correcte,12D correcte_188,Q,"So would you, with this experience under your belt, put your hand up for another board in another industry?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_189,A,"I would love to one day and it’s certainly in the plans. I think that for now my focus is on getting really good grounding, so I go through my [SED] 01:08:44 and probably finish this term at THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD first before I consider anything. I would love to. I think for me it's a matter of finding an organisation with similar values to what THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL  is espousing in that they see the value of having – whether it's me or someone like me, in the boardroom. Which having done a little bit of research don't think that that's most organisations. So, it's probably a matter of finding the right fit both from their values perspective and ultimately I want to do something meaningful. So finding an organisation that both wants someone like me in the room and with whom I want to work, which is a very small pool I think."
12D correcte,12D correcte_19,Q,And what was her role on the board?
12D correcte,12D correcte_190,Q,"You're in the network now though, you can keep your ear to the ground with your fellow board members. How do you feel about the use of the government, like ASX does, gender targets, but let's imagine age targets because we're looking to have some people under 40 on boards, let's say, increase that segment? What do you think that might look like? Do you think it might be effective, doable, of any use?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_191,A,"People ask me about targets a lot, and I never really have a good answer. I'm very much on the fence about them."
12D correcte,12D correcte_192,Q,Why?
12D correcte,12D correcte_193,A,"In that I can certainly see why they're beneficial, that's an easy argument to me. I think it's about the unintended consequences, like when you appoint people who – so you give an organisation – so this is worst-case scenario. You give an organisation a target, they don't espouse the values that their target is trying to identify and address. They appoint a person who may or may not have the requisite skillset. Maybe they just needed that opportunity but they aren't given the proper encouragement and welcome within the boardroom anyway, so they have a terrible experience or they don't contribute in a meaningful way. That board also gets to kind of wash their hands of the issue because they've dealt with it but not in any meaningful way. So that person is allowed to sit at the table but as to whether their opinion is welcomed or listened to, that's a cultural and values decision. So yes, you could do it but it won't necessarily have the impacts required. And at the same time, it could be really harmful for that individual for their own personal career, and frankly, their wellbeing."
12D correcte,12D correcte_194,Q,"I can see, and that goes back to your earlier conversation about the imposter syndrome and –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_195,A,Even if they feel like they are worthy of being in that room but they're surrounded by 10 people who say to their face or behind their backs you're only here because of X.
12D correcte,12D correcte_196,Q,"Particular box, yeah, and they’ll be quiet. Yeah exactly, fabulous. Now this is the last question. Looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards? And what do you think needs to happen for that to occur?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_197,A,I mean best case scenario would be that we're not talking about it anymore because everything is wonderful.
12D correcte,12D correcte_198,Q,Love it.
12D correcte,12D correcte_199,A,"That seems unlikely. Look I think, now being realistic, I hope that there's more and more people making a lot of noise about it and whether it's – because I think ultimately it needs to be a cultural and social change. So you can put in targets in the short term and because you've got a few powerful people who have made this decision, but until society changes and business culture changes, then diversity won't be properly embraced. So the more people who subscribe to this thinking and who are quite vocal about it, that's probably the best that I can hope for. And whether that's the boardroom or it's just diversity in general. And being accepting of other points of view in your own team more. And I think a lot of that I'm hopeful will happen because people of my generation typically tend to be quite – there are lots of – they certainly have lots of flaws, but they tend to think about things in quite flat structures and organisations have started reflecting that, so age and experience is not as relevant sometimes in certain business cultures, because there are so many new industries and so many new roles that everybody comes in knowing nothing anyway. So I'm hopeful that as this kind of generation moves up, not only will they now be in those positions in boardrooms, but because they have had this different experience and different point of view around what hierarchies look like, and boards are definitely seen as a top hierarchy, that they'll open the door and welcome people who have less experience or different experience, because that's how they experience their working life."
12D correcte,12D correcte_2,Q,You sent it to me didn’t you?
12D correcte,12D correcte_20,A,Initially she was just a director and then during my tenure she became the chair.
12D correcte,12D correcte_200,A,"Whereas, I feel like board members today in their working life experience quite hierarchical structures. You do your time, you get promoted, you do your time, you get promoted. So if the natural progression is probably that people my generation will get to the top of their careers, sit on the boards but then hopefully open the door."
12D correcte,12D correcte_201,Q,Open the door for others without going up the hierarchy?
12D correcte,12D correcte_202,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_203,Q,"So the hierarchy is not the essential feeder to board positions in the future, that will be your hope? That in 10 years’ time, that management, that ladder with all its broken runs and people pushing you down, that ladder up is not the only way to the board and for governing organisations?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_204,A,"Yeah, I think that will sort of be disrupted. I think it will certainly still be the way for my generation that it is still seen as the top, but hopefully once we get there because we had a different experience, that they will think about things differently."
12D correcte,12D correcte_205,Q,"Great.  And do you think there's something that needs to happen to like, you know, legislation, you're familiar now with boards, any legislative changes or is it more just cultural? Industry bodies, director programs perhaps?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_206,A,Now look I’d selfishly say it would be fantastic if there was more support for young people.
12D correcte,12D correcte_207,Q,"Yeah, no that’s good."
12D correcte,12D correcte_208,A,"I think I've been really lucky in having the support of some quite experienced directors who have been able to kind of guide me through the process. And even conversations that I had with AICD quite early on of other people who wanted to undertake the program. The question of, so you get the accreditation and then find a role or do you find a role and then get the accreditation? How important is it? Which parts are important? What type of experience is important? Having mentors to guide you through that processes. And I think I've spoken to THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD a few times, I think they're quite open and transparent about what they believe the best process is as well. So those conversations are very helpful."
12D correcte,12D correcte_209,Q,"Okay, so that's a useful organisation to help people for your future board as well, the way it looks. Well thank you so much. Have you any last comments you'd like to make? The aim of the research is to enable board diversity and we're looking beyond gender."
12D correcte,12D correcte_21,Q,"Right. Was she a mentor for you do you think, did she encourage you?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_210,A,I think it's a fantastic piece of work. And I certainly hope that it results to see diversity on our boards.
12D correcte,12D correcte_211,Q,Oh. I think we'll have to be humble – let’s hope it is a push in the right direction.
12D correcte,12D correcte_212,A,I'm sure it will be.
12D correcte,12D correcte_213,Q,"Yeah, with people like you maybe we'll get there. Okay. Thank you so much."
12D correcte,12D correcte_22,A,"She did. There was certainly huge support from all of the board members at that time. There was some that I was close to and they had a quite a formal introduction in that you were paired up with a buddy director etc., to introduce you to the program. It was, again much like my experience with THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD, I think I've been very fortunate in that they were also operate at a very high level. And so that was fantastic grounding and I still keep in contact with a number of the board members. I'm just so personally – it's a small – Melbourne certainly it's a small community so you see people in all different types of forums again. And from that experience – and I can't be absolutely sure, but at the time when I joined as an advisor they brought on two other young people at the same time."
12D correcte,12D correcte_23,Q,As advisors?
12D correcte,12D correcte_24,A,"As advisors.  And the three of us sat in different subcommittees. So I think for them it was an opportunity, and I don't know completely, but I think for them it was an opportunity to get insight from people that they believed were important part of their community into the various elements of governance. And whilst two of us didn't stay on in the long term, one of them is – I believe she was still with the board last time I checked. So she became a director."
12D correcte,12D correcte_25,Q,"She’s now on the board? Great. And how old would she be? Like your age, bit older, maybe younger?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_26,A,Maybe a few years older but I wouldn't say too much.
12D correcte,12D correcte_27,Q,"Yeah, but young. Okay, so you were on like training wheels there?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_28,A,Yeah a little bit.
12D correcte,12D correcte_29,Q,They provided a buddy to help you learn about the board without taking on all the responsibilities?
12D correcte,12D correcte_3,A,"Yes, I've sent you one but there’s a hard copy."
12D correcte,12D correcte_30,A,Yeah.
12D correcte,12D correcte_31,Q,Did they put you through a course like with the Australian Institute?
12D correcte,12D correcte_32,A,"It was floated and discussed with them and the secretary at the time. I felt like it might be more useful when I had more practical experience. I felt like maybe – and whilst I thought that was a fantastic experience, it was also in some ways quite difficult because I was privy only to a portion of what the board was doing. So being involved with one subcommittee did make it – I felt incredibly useful and like I was contributing, but I didn't feel like I had good oversight over everything the organisation was doing. So I personally didn't feel like it was the right time for the company director’s course with the AICD. Now that I'm with THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD and have had – so I've been on the board now for 16 months or so, I'll probably look to undertake that this year, because I feel like I've sat in the role for the while, I understood how it works, have a level of oversight that I feel comfortable with, and can now feel like I would take a lot more out of that course. Where I felt like I'd looked at some materials that I received through online and various other resources, and I just felt like maybe it wouldn't resonate as highly until I'd had some experience."
12D correcte,12D correcte_33,Q,"That makes sense, yeah. Now Will THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD pay for you to do this cause or you pay for yourself?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_34,A,"I haven't asked the question yet. Regardless of whether – I haven't asked a question yet, it's a voluntary position with THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD. And I feel regardless of whether they would be willing to support that or not, I think for my own benefits and also for my own peace of mind, I would be prepared to make that investment either way. And I think maybe this unique experience, I don't know if it, I shouldn't say that, I don't know if it's a unique experience, but certainly as a young person it's a big expense to consider a two week course."
12D correcte,12D correcte_35,Q,How much is it now?
12D correcte,12D correcte_36,A,"The last time I checked it was something like 11,000."
12D correcte,12D correcte_37,Q,Yeah this is a big chunk out of your –
12D correcte,12D correcte_38,A,"Because you went to uni, you may well even have a HECS debt, or someone your age often does. Because I'm just thinking these are barriers to come up with ten thousand plus for a course for an unpaid role, it's a lot to ask if someone's you know put a HECS debt and you know often other expenses like mortgages might be coming on the horizon."
12D correcte,12D correcte_39,A,"I mean I appreciate that and why I hesitated once I said maybe this is a young person's issue. Everybody has different expenses and we can never really know, so I think it could be prohibitively high for many people regardless of their age."
12D correcte,12D correcte_4,Q,"Oh perfect, thank you, thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Now you’re particularly interesting to me because you are so young compared to the other people I've interviewed, you're 28. In fact you told me you're a female and your parents are from Malaysia, although you were born here in Australia. But you went to a private school you said. And so you think that helped you get on the board?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_40,Q,"Exactly, good point. But for someone young it's probably across the board. I don't know even if your parents are particularly well-off, they might balk at forking out that sort of money. I don't know, you know, for something that's not going to return any investment or whatever, however they might calculate. But anyway, these are barriers, potential barriers. You mentioned your skilled volunteering, now your bank, the one you worked with, do they have a volunteer program?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_41,A,"They do. It's primarily used – broad generalisations, in the areas that I worked it’s broadly used as a team bonding activity that the teams would go out and perform some kind of volunteering, whether it was skilled or otherwise. And it was definitely encouraged. Most of my volunteering I did outside of work. So in some cases I actually felt that I needed to inform my workplace so that they wouldn't be concerned with conflicts or – conflicts of interest or also just conflicts in time and commitment. I had those conversations when I first stepped into the advisory role with A YOUTH ORGANISATION. And they were supportive but there was certainly an expectation that your role is what comes first and we expect you to perform that well."
12D correcte,12D correcte_42,Q,"Right. So were these meetings that you attended, were they during office hours or after office hours?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_43,A,"Typically before work. And my experience has been that's typically before work and maybe a few – maybe till 9 o'clock, so depending on what time you normally start work it may interfere or not. But that's been the same experience with THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD and I think that's reflective of the fact that many board members have day jobs that they are meant to get to as well. So I guess that's a consideration for everybody."
12D correcte,12D correcte_44,Q,"So that's good. So your role at the bank, like your background from uni, what did you do?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_45,A,"So I studied bachelor of commerce at Melbourne Uni. I majored in finance and management. Wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do, went into one of the banking grad programs. I was really fortunate to have some fantastic experiences there across strategy, another team that was very technical, I wasn’t there for very long but where developed some really valuable technical skills. And then I moved into a permanent role in the institutional banking division working with industrial clients. So I was there for about three years, perhaps a little more. And concurrently I was volunteering and a few years into my role I also started a business. So I was busy at that time."
12D correcte,12D correcte_46,Q,"Yeah you were. So with the potential for conflicts of interest with the bank, so you're an employee in the management stream, and let's say clients, for their or something, they might appear in the context of your board making decisions. How do you manage that potential for conflict?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_47,A,"I was fortunate that it never did arise for me. But I think in my own reflections, it wasn't very likely that any of the clients with which I had a relationship would appear in a board room setting for decisions. So it would have probably been procurements and would probably have been left with management in most cases. And if it had arisen to the board then I would have to notify the chair and –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_48,Q,"So you’d manage it – yeah. So your bank, when you talked to the bank, your manager there, were they concerned about – did they raise any concerns about this and instruct you about how you might manage it or they just left it to you?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_49,A,"No concerns from the bank's point of view. I also didn't think that they – you know they are quite conscious of conflicts of interest, and I don't think that they perceived that there was a high risk –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_5,A,"Yeah, absolutely. So I think I'm aware that my position on the board is quite unique given my particular background and experience."
12D correcte,12D correcte_50,Q,Because of the nature of the board.
12D correcte,12D correcte_51,A,"Because of the nature of the board. Particularly when I was with the bank then, it was an advisory role, it wasn't strictly a board directorship. So there are a few other nuances to the relationship. So, they were probably more conscious of conflicts in commitment."
12D correcte,12D correcte_52,Q,Yes exactly. Your resources and commitment. So you're still with the bank?
12D correcte,12D correcte_53,A,"No I'm not, I should have mentioned that earlier."
12D correcte,12D correcte_54,Q,You're not with the bank now –
12D correcte,12D correcte_55,A,No.
12D correcte,12D correcte_56,Q,So are you in your own business now?
12D correcte,12D correcte_57,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_58,Q,Full time?
12D correcte,12D correcte_59,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_6,Q,Which is –
12D correcte,12D correcte_60,Q,So you can manage your own conflicts of interests?
12D correcte,12D correcte_61,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_62,Q,It's much easier for you.
12D correcte,12D correcte_63,A,Yes.
12D correcte,12D correcte_64,Q,"Perfect. And you just have to manage it through the chair as you describe, okay. Do you feel – let's say can you imagine, if you had the board position at THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD and you spoke to your manager at the bank, might they be concerned because you're now a director and do you think they might have raised some concerns about conflict of interest?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_65,A,"I wouldn't think so. I think that there are certain roles outside of work that institutions like that, so the bank that I was working for was one of the major banks, and I think they would have on a day to day basis been fairly agnostic about my involvements. And I think in other certain settings they'd see it as great opportunity."
12D correcte,12D correcte_66,Q,"So it wouldn't have been a barrier, it would have been easy to negotiate that?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_67,A,"Yeah. And I don't think that they – I can't imagine any circumstance where they would have said that they had an issue with it, particularly given it's a not-for-profit cause, it was working in a sector that I don't have any direct involvement with. So it would be hard to see where they would have had an issue. Had I been working – I did work briefly in the school sector within the bank. I think then they may have been some issues but that would have been a very clear conflict of interest."
12D correcte,12D correcte_68,Q,Yeah.
12D correcte,12D correcte_69,A,"I don't know what I would have done if I'd still be working in the school sector, that would be a different – lots of moving pieces there to imagine."
12D correcte,12D correcte_7,A,"At least within the Australian context. As you've already mentioned, I'm quite young compared to many average board members, I think. And in my own limited understanding, perhaps it's slightly more common in a not for profit board setting that you'll have a slightly younger demographic. But certainly working with the a private school board, which is a very highly qualified and well-trained board, it's a great privilege to be able to be involved, and I think that my involvement speaks to the commitment of the board itself in wanting to have diversity. And that's diversity across a number of metrics, which includes obviously it's girls school, there’s commitment to having women on the board and also having representatives who are a bit younger because they want to understand how things have changed in schooling and also in work after school. So I think that's where I sit, in addition to sort of the technical skill set that they look for in terms of the board."
12D correcte,12D correcte_70,Q,"Exactly. So because at the management level, so if you're the CE, then you can sort of sit on boards in your own industry and just declare a conflict of interest whatever, but you have the authority within your own organisation to do that. I'm just thinking if you're lower down in the management pipeline, then there's probably less flexibility about that. But that, as you point out, you work out what industry is this board in and you target that industry, or you avoid an industry that you might have conflict of interests with."
12D correcte,12D correcte_71,A,"Yeah. I think, just now reflecting on it, the bigger issue as a young person, so I would have been 22 when I had that first conversation with the bank around this advisory role. And I didn't think of it as an issue as at the time because it was something that I want to do, so I was very prepared to have whatever conversations I needed to. But subsequent to that time, I spoke to a lot of my peers, and we were all entry level roles, so you're at the very bottom and you're there with usually the point of view that you're trying to build towards the next role, the next promotion. And I know that it was a big concern for people to raise, whether it had been volunteering with the board or volunteering with any organisation, there's a lot of concern about raising any kind of conflict in commitment and time with work. So I imagine that to be very barrier for people whether or not they actually perceive that they have the time to make it to the commitment of a board, I'm not sure. But certainly being able to have that conversation with a workplace."
12D correcte,12D correcte_72,A,"Because I think the feeling is generally, yes they'll support you unless there's an obvious conflict of interest, but in a softer way you don't know what impact that might have on your future prospects. So a lot of people might be – lot of my peers who were sometimes very interested in governance didn't really consider it as an option because their main role in work, which is what pays for their lifestyles, needed to come first."
12D correcte,12D correcte_73,Q,"Yeah. Do you think there is a tall poppy thing that might get in the way, being so young? Just out of uni, advisor on a board, your manager has probably never been an advisor on a board or that close to a board? Do you think there could be a tall poppy barrier within management/ Did you feel that or you may not have?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_74,A,"Yeah I'm thinking about it now. Maybe behind closed doors. I don't think anybody ever said something to my face. There were probably definitely a few people that were a bit sceptical. And you have to have a certain resolution about what you believe you can contribute. And everybody, not everybody, many people suffer from imposter syndrome from time to time. And I certainly, when I began conversations with the field, the directors in considering an application for the THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD,– the THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD had been in the press significantly in the past, and it was a high profile board with high profile members so I had a lot of reservations about getting involved. And there's only so many seats on the table and you want everybody to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. So I had that conversation with at least two directors ahead of even applying for –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_75,Q,Of the board?
12D correcte,12D correcte_76,A,"Of the board, yeah. I'm not sure how much – tall poppy definitely plays into that because if you feel like people around you also are a bit sceptical about your involvement, compounded with the effects of an imposter syndrome, then it could be quite prohibitive, it would stop you ever applying for anything in the first place."
12D correcte,12D correcte_77,Q,Can you explain to me your imposter syndrome? I’d like to understand that a little more.
12D correcte,12D correcte_78,A,"Just feeling like you are in a room and not qualified to be there, or that other people believe of you something that you don't believe in yourself. I think that – I'm not sure what the definition of imposter syndrome is, but that's how I understand it. So the feeling that – and it was a great privilege to be appointed to the THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD, and to walk in and be very – I to do quite a bit of reflection to say, Okay, well this is what I know and I acknowledge that there are many things that I don't know about, technically when it comes to the operations of the school and even various aspects of governance. So I don't have any practical experience and considering the rem committee or just different aspects and I've been appointed to the board and the farm subcommittee.” And I had some experience in finance given my professional work, but certainly not at the depth of what some of the other candidates had even had. So some of the other candidates were, and other directors, were partners in leading accountancy firms."
12D correcte,12D correcte_79,A,"So, sitting at the table to go, “Okay, well I've got four years of banking experience.” But being supported by the rest of the board members to say, “Okay well this is how you add value” and they've been so supportive and been very clear that I'm contributing to the board and the organisation more broadly, so that's comforting."
12D correcte,12D correcte_8,Q,"Brilliant. So tell me, what age spread would you – like are there any others perhaps in their thirties on the board?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_80,Q,"That's really good. So the imposter syndrome is a self-perception, is it? So it affects your confidence and then you feel like you’re an outsider. So then it's the others have to build that bridge to you."
12D correcte,12D correcte_81,A,"Yeah definitely. I think it's less of an issue now that I'm on the board, but it was certainly an issue in considering applying."
12D correcte,12D correcte_82,Q,It was a barrier?
12D correcte,12D correcte_83,A,Yeah.
12D correcte,12D correcte_84,Q,"Okay. So you needed to be wooed by these couple of board members, actually helping you to see you would be adding value?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_85,A,"Yeah. And I think that comes from as well – again this is not to my credit at all, but the board had gone through a very rigorous process to evaluate where their skills and expertise lay and they had identified that this is something that they wanted. So they've made a commitment to – and they certainly weren't going to appoint anybody. So they needed someone with the requisite skill set, but they were conscious of the fact that they wanted someone who could speak a little bit more to the experience of a few things which I can speak to."
12D correcte,12D correcte_86,Q,"Yeah, like students’ experience?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_87,A,Yeah or even –
12D correcte,12D correcte_88,Q,Career trajectories?
12D correcte,12D correcte_89,A,"Career trajectory. So I have a very, and I think the schooling system is very different now to when I was at school 10 years ago. But it's probably more relevant than the other board members, and I also since then have had a very – I've had a career that does not resemble what the other board members have had, irrespective of the board role itself. I've worked for a big firm and then started my own businesses, which I now run alongside various volunteering roles. And it's that idea of a lot more fluidity in my professional life that is quite valuable. Further to that, I think having the perspective of someone with – and there are a lot of different perspectives in that room, but a migrant background, particularly with some Asian heritage, Chinese influences, given the way that demographics are changing in Melbourne particularly, is just a different point of view that colours some of the conversations that we have in the boardroom."
12D correcte,12D correcte_9,A,"Oh, now you’re [pressing] 00:02:28 me. No I don’t think –"
12D correcte,12D correcte_90,Q,"And do you feel that your conversations are heard, that your voice is heard, your particular voice?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_91,A,Absolutely.
12D correcte,12D correcte_92,Q,Give me an example of how that's managed?
12D correcte,12D correcte_93,A,"So I see my role in that boardroom specifically as asking questions that other people might not think to ask. So typically how it would go is, I would reflect on my own experiences or the experiences of my peers and pose a question in whatever context that discussion is happening, and it'll either be built upon by other directors or management will take it away to investigate. So, I think it's just a matter of being able to ask a question that can then get addressed. And it doesn't always mean that it immediately gets actioned in any way but at least then we can have a discussion about where that point of view comes from and whether we can confidently say that we know enough about that or do we need to do more investigative work. I feel sometimes that there's a lot of responsibility in expressing some of these views, because I'm conscious that at the end of the day I am speaking only from my experience and some anecdotal evidence of people around me. So a lot of it has to be supported by further research from management or whoever else they get involved. But it's just a starting point for a question to be asked."
12D correcte,12D correcte_94,Q,"Yeah, the research then starts. Whereas, before it would be just left, there's no hypotheses, no question, so the research doesn't happen. That's really good. Okay, so everyone on the board plays a role in that, it's not like the chair is integral in this process. All of the members on the board interact with you?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_95,A,"The THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD board is fantastic in that I think it's very open, I think everybody feels quite comfortable to express their opinions. I was certainly more reserved when I first joined the board, but I think that was natural in wanting to get an understanding of the culture and how things ran as opposed to feeling uncomfortable. It was just more about familiarity. Now I almost need to be careful not to take up too much time."
12D correcte,12D correcte_96,Q,"That's lovely. Tell me because you went to the school itself, do you feel that – is the board a mirror of that culture? Do you feel it's a familiar culture for you?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_97,A,"This is pushing me to think back to that school. Look I think certainly the board espouses the values of the school, so as to whether it’s a direct reflection of the culture? Harder to say, but I think it's definitely built upon the same values. Which makes complete sense. I think if the board was being guided by values other than what the organisation stood for, the incongruity would be very obvious somewhere. So yeah, I think it’s been – it was obvious from even before I joined the board in that the directors that I did speak to were so willing. And these weren't directors that I had any relationship with. I think I'd met one of them at an event, at a school related event in passing. And I saw her name so I thought I'd reach out, and it was complete cold. I reached out on LinkedIn, “So I'm thinking about this, I think we've met before but I'm not sure.” And she took time out of her weekend to have a coffee with me and talk about what it was like to be on the board and her experience and why she was involved. And then after that conversation when I decided that I would think about it more seriously I reached out to the chair, who again I hadn't met before and we didn't have a chance to meet up in person but we spoke over the phone and through those conversations I felt like I should put my name in the ring."
12D correcte,12D correcte_98,Q,"So you reached out to have those conversations, they didn't come to you?"
12D correcte,12D correcte_99,A,"Yes. Although I have to say I reached out on LinkedIn and that first conversation – so Annie, who's one of the other directors, we went out for coffee locally and I think one of her comments to me was like – well actually it probably wasn't at this first meeting, it was probably once I'd already joined the board. She’s like, “Let's be honest, you've been around.” So I think they didn't reach out to me but by the time they'd received my application they were all familiar at least with my name because of other work that I'd done with the school since I'd left. So I'm quite actively involved in some other aspects of the school. And I think that as well was reflected well in their consideration to appoint me to the board. It’s, I have demonstrated my commitment and I'm familiar with these aspects of the school community."
13IN,13IN_1,A,Sure.
13IN,13IN_10,A,"And so we talk about the role we play in directly attracting, having conversations with potential female board members, or those from different age demographics, so millennials, for example, as well.  We actively play a role in sourcing and having conversations and bringing those people into the mix."
13IN,13IN_100,Q,"And gender diversity, what is that?  Is that just something you can measure that is a rough indicator of that?  Or it’s something different to cognitive diversity?  I’m just trying to think how these concepts work together."
13IN,13IN_101,A,I’m not sure I understand.
13IN,13IN_102,Q,"If I’m getting an understanding of what you mean, cognitive diversity is like the root.  It’s through being able to manage complex decision-making in a dynamic and uncertain environment.  That’s important, that’s performance."
13IN,13IN_103,Q,"So that capacity that cognitive diversity gives you - now, we’re talking about people.  We’re trying to find the right people to give cognitive diversity.  Gender’s one that we can measure, and it’s important.  But gender, you did say that you feel there tends to be a difference in thinking with different genders, but it wasn’t the only thing.  Cognitive diversity, if I’m getting you right, is something much more fundamental, and there’s other factors.  Gender diversity won’t get it for you;  it’s insufficient."
13IN,13IN_104,Q,"So what else - I’m trying to get a schema in my head, if I’m getting this right.  Let’s think of an inverted triangle, performance is down the bottom.  That’s what the ultimate goal.  Cognitive diversity is the means to that end, but cognitive diversity, how do we find that?  Well, we can measure by gender and graph it. There’s other kinds of diversity you said, diversity of background.  Are these just different kinds of diversity that you hope will deliver cognitive diversity?  Is it that, is that the logic?"
13IN,13IN_105,A,Yeah.
13IN,13IN_106,Q,Is it?
13IN,13IN_107,A,"I think so.  From where you’re coming from, I think I understand what you’re saying.If where I’m hearing you, to get to the nirvana?"
13IN,13IN_108,Q,Yes.
13IN,13IN_109,A,"If that’s the sort of goal, I believe it’s a little bit like - there’s a number of layers, I think, is where -"
13IN,13IN_11,Q,How do you do that?
13IN,13IN_110,Q,I’m trying to understand -
13IN,13IN_111,A,"Because there’s gender - I mean, there’s obviously skills, and age."
13IN,13IN_112,Q,"Yeah, skills matrix."
13IN,13IN_113,A,"There’s a whole range of other components that create the formula, potentially, for those - that level of decision-making.  But, again, overarching all of those things is good leadership, and the bringing of it together, common goals alignment, constant review.  There’s a lot in it.  Diversity’s all one thing, but it’s about how it’s brought together and how it’s managed effectively to get the best outcomes."
13IN,13IN_114,Q,So now that comes to good functioning.  So how might this diversity be facilitated or whatever so as it leads to optimal board functioning?
13IN,13IN_115,A,"Let’s go back to the top:  ‘What’s our vision, and what’s the one and three-year goal, and what do the headwinds look like;  as an organisation what are our values, and do we have the right leader in place to guide us and share that vision’.  That’s the role of the chair, and to an extent, the CEO."
13IN,13IN_116,A,"So if we’ve got that really clear, and we’ve and understood the matrix, and that’s aligned to that strategy, and we are aware that diversity has economic impacts - and then we’ve got the right level of behaviours and board performance review, KPIs, and coaching and mentorship and feedback - if all of that comes together, then the formula is there for you to be in a much better place than if it’s not."
13IN,13IN_117,Q,And do your services help with these different - what different parts of this process do you -
13IN,13IN_118,A,The core part of the services we provide is around the sourcing and introduction of executives and non-executives.  And that’s our core service.  The how that we do that - which we talked about at the start - is through networking and head-hunting and all those components.  But the service really is around the understanding.
13IN,13IN_119,Q,Of what they need.
13IN,13IN_12,A,"As an executive search firm, we do that through networking, through head-hunting, through more traditional methods which might be advertising, but it’s less so.  It’s more about proactively identifying."
13IN,13IN_120,A,"Of what they need.  And then it’s around the coaching, and it’s around the influencing to get the right people into those organisations or onto those boards.  There is an element post-that that we provide as well, which is assessment, and so the assessment is around looking at the performance of the executive team or looking at the performance of the board.  That can be done through understanding what the KPIs are, individually assessing an individual through interviewing, and through - whether it’s some sort of 360 feedback.  The board might review each other and we can align that together and we can feed back that to a chair.  And then we can look to get process improvement."
13IN,13IN_121,Q,"But by understanding the full picture, you might ask questions about, ‘How does the chair manage, perhaps, conflict and difference on the board’?"
13IN,13IN_122,A,Correct.
13IN,13IN_123,Q,"‘And maybe we need some strategies around that’, and then someone else does that?"
13IN,13IN_124,A,"Good question.  Our core business is around executive sourcing and selection.  In terms of the coaching and ongoing mentoring of a chair, and the facilitation of improvement of board performance, that’s not our core business."
13IN,13IN_125,Q,Who does that sort of stuff?
13IN,13IN_126,A,"There are people within the - [Maryanne] 00:36:44, for example."
13IN,13IN_127,Q,"Yes, that’s what I’m thinking, so the leadership coaching."
13IN,13IN_128,A,"The leadership coaching would be really - experienced at all sites and have got board experience.  The area we would be effective in would be around - because our core business is around assessment, so assessment of an individual’s capability for a potential role, and then it’s around assessment of an individual in their existing role.  That would be based on a framework and a number of competencies that align to their role, and there’s a number of qualitative and quantitative tools that we’d use to formulate that assessment, some sort of testing, or interviewing, or interviewing others."
13IN,13IN_129,A,"But, again, if it’s aligned to a framework, we can come up with an assessment, a review, some recommendations.  And then there are others who would work with the board to get them to the next level on an ongoing basis.  We’d probablyhandle itat that stage."
13IN,13IN_13,A,"Part of the how is around working through industries, working through organisations, working through people and talent within those businesses or on different boards, and approaching them and having direct conversations about where they are at on their professional journey, whether that’s in that executive pathway or that non-executive pathway.  That’s the how.  It’s around a direct approach in working, head-hunting conversations."
13IN,13IN_130,Q,It’s a complex field.  It must cost quite a bit.  I didn’t think about the costs of actually developing and maintaining a well-functioning board.
13IN,13IN_131,A,Yes.
13IN,13IN_132,Q,"I didn’t even think of it as a cost, to be hones so there you go.  Now, we’ve talked about cognitive diversity.  How might you identify that when selecting board members?"
13IN,13IN_133,A,"So like in any process, there’s a methodology of behavioural-based interviewing, which we use as a  way of understanding someone’s ability around strategy, leadership, corporate governance.  And so we can look at the past behaviours to predict the future.  That’s one way."
13IN,13IN_134,A,"We would reference with other individuals their experiences, so a reference-checking process as well.  We can test for commercial, financial acumen, leadership capability, work preferences.  There’s a number of tools we can use again.  Similar that we would use to assess the existing performance, we’d use to assess their potential."
13IN,13IN_135,Q,"If I was applying for a board, and you were involved in that selection process, I would be filling out questionnaires?"
13IN,13IN_136,A,"Probably not.  It would probably be more done on an interview basis.  But there could be some testing as well that’s done on top of that.  Psychometric or analytical, numerical, or deductive."
13IN,13IN_137,Q,"I mean, we’ve all done Myers-Briggs, anyone who’s worked in an organisation.  They’re from around the world, you source them, and you apply them, so they’re those sorts of tools we’re talking about?"
13IN,13IN_138,A,Yes.  That’s correct.
13IN,13IN_139,Q,Are you a psychologist?
13IN,13IN_14,Q,"Now, do you do anything or facilitate mentorship of people who might not be quite ready but they want to move into board positions in the future?"
13IN,13IN_140,A,"No, but we work with psychologists.  And those sorts of Myers-Briggs or personality testing are not necessarily the tools to make the decisions.They’re more so around - and if you were the chair, that could be really useful in terms of, ‘Well, what’s this individual’s work preferences?  How do I understand this individual?’, more so to get the best out of them and to use techniques to draw the best out of them."
13IN,13IN_141,Q,"It’s to cultivate board candidates, and I was thinking there are people from social-economic disadvantaged backgrounds, for example.  They might struggle to pay to do a course, management and whatever, a director’s course, and they might have gone to the wrong university or they went to the wrong school.  So you’ve got someone from that background."
13IN,13IN_142,Q,"But they’ve come onto your radar through your networking or something.  They might have done law at Victoria Uni, but someone told me that they know a legal firm that deliberately sources graduates from Victoria University law because they are determined to succeed.  But that person may come with very little of the social-economic resources.  Is there anything you might do to help someone like that?  They can’t afford to pay for the course, they probably haven’t had some of the opportunities that others might have had.  Can you do anything?  Is it in your brief capacity?"
13IN,13IN_143,A,"There’s lots of examples where we identify special people, special talent, and invest time and energyand adviceand coaching and counselling around how best they manage their own career.  That might be not necessarily paying for the AICD, but it might be around getting them access to people and leaders and individuals who might be able to get them onto a board, whether it’s a not-for-profit - or to facilitate that effectively for them."
13IN,13IN_144,A,"And there’s a recent example of a board we recently worked with who are in this space, so a not-for-profit, a non-paying board and more of a working board.  And through referrals and speaking to a well-known director, we were given access to an individual who’s an exec.  And this would be their first board role.  An individual who - the brief we talked about, a refugee here in Australia, came out here, put himself through accounting, and he’s now working for a bank.  And this was their first board role.  And they’re probably a 34-year old individual."
13IN,13IN_145,A,"It’s the joining of the dots through the networking and the identification of good people, and then the introduction.  And if you get a skills matrix of that particular board, it’s a really nice fit."
13IN,13IN_146,Q,"And that board paid for the person to do the board course?  The - whatever you called it, management -"
13IN,13IN_147,A,"Maybe.  I don’t know if that particular organisation will, but there’d be no reason why, if the funds were there, for every board to want every one of their members to have done the GAICD."
13IN,13IN_148,Q,It’s a capacity building strategy.  What do you see as the main barriers to building diversity boards in Australia?
13IN,13IN_149,A,Old-school views.  Old-school boards.  Boys’ clubs.
13IN,13IN_15,A,"Yes, to an extent.  Part of our role in the executive search space is to guide, coach not in a structured way - i.e. structured mentorship program - but really just through advice and consultation.  We will do that naturally as part of the conversation we have with individuals."
13IN,13IN_150,Q,I’m going to ask you to explain what these mean.  Give me examples.
13IN,13IN_151,A,"Well, old-school views are - and, again, it comes back to this whole notion of unconscious bias.  And so that’s the biggest [inaudible] 00:45:09.  Looking for people like me, wanting to feel comfortable around individuals, and a misconception that finding people like you is a good thing."
13IN,13IN_152,Q,"Do you think there’s a bit of a demographic around this?  I’m thinking baby boomer, are they more prone to liking people to be more like them than, say, the millennials?  Or are the younger ones more open and comfortable with diversity, do you think, than, perhaps, the 60-plus?"
13IN,13IN_153,A,I don’t know.  I don’t have the answer.  I’d love to see if there’s any research on that.
13IN,13IN_154,Q,I haven’t seen any.
13IN,13IN_155,A,"It’s a really interesting point.  Because I don’t know if necessarily all millennials are as diverse as we think in their thinking.  Yeah, I don’t know the answer to that question.  There’s a lot of data to suggest what millennials - I mean, we know the kind of history around millennials being - and having a draw towards being more purpose-driven and cause-related.  So you could argue that there potentially could be that link to being a bit more open to more diversity, but I don’t know.  I’d be interested if there’s any data on this."
13IN,13IN_156,Q,"It’d have to be in Australia, too, rather than -"
13IN,13IN_157,A,"Yeah, I don’t know the answer to that question.  My gut would say they probably are.  But I don’t know."
13IN,13IN_158,Q,"Because I’m just thinking, the high school kids, 40 years ago high school kids looked much more homogenous than now because we’re a much more diverse -"
13IN,13IN_159,A,"Yes, so my gut would say they probably are.  But I haven’t seen the data on that."
13IN,13IN_16,A,"And that might be around the how, how they might build up their skills to become more attractive to a board.  That might be through finding ways to introduce them to the right people - be it shares or selection committees - to be on the radar, if you like, to have more access to those sorts of opportunities."
13IN,13IN_160,Q,"I’ll see if there’s some research on that at some stage, I think.  So barriers, what do these barriers - situation five years ago, you’ve said that.  You said five years ago it was less diverse, perhaps?  Five years, anyway.  How do you feel about the lack of change?  Or do you feel it’s changed much in five years?  Diversity, the appetite for it?"
13IN,13IN_161,A,"Yeah, I’m going to have a punt at this one.  And the gender conversation’s probably the one that’s got the most noise."
13IN,13IN_162,Q,How do you feel about that?
13IN,13IN_163,A,"I think it’s great.  I think what I said before was - I’ll use an example of PwC.  PwC have doubled their workforce in the last five years;  as in, their numbers of staff.  They actually made the decision as a leadership group that the notion of diversity was a really hard one to address, every bucket, so the one they chose was gender.  And they actually have quotas - with a very old-school partner group, very male-dominated - around the numbers of female partners that are promoted."
13IN,13IN_164,A,"And what that’s actually forced in their organisation has actually meant that they’ve become more diverse in education.Because it actually - they can’t rely on accountants and lawyers just - a lot of males, so they’ve gone out to other - engineers and a number of other faculties.  They’ve gone into a broader ethnicity base to get more female talent into the organisation.  And as a result of having a focus on the quota of females and, ‘We need to promote more female partners’, it’s actually broadened the diversity of other groups as a result because of the lack of talent that they’ve had.  They’ve had to be wider in their recruitment."
13IN,13IN_165,A,"I think gender’s probably the one that’s driven the most noise, but I think that that’s had an impact on other diversity buckets, if you like."
13IN,13IN_166,Q,"That’s really interesting.  That relates back to an earlier question.  That’s a really interesting idea.  And so, in a way, it’s served us well that in the university sector, which I obviously look at as a feeder.  There’s some gender bias.  There’s not as many female engineers, for example.  I’m going to be interviewing this woman who is an advocate for female engineers in a couple of days.  But that lack of females in that area - then in the mining, if they’re asking for a quota of females, it might pull in people from philosophy, other backgrounds, because there’s a lack of female engineers.  I like that."
13IN,13IN_167,A,"Correct.  So the correlation between - whilst I don’t agree with quotas, they went down the quota pathway.  But it got them to a stage where they as an organisation - so the economics were that they’ve doubled their business somewhat in the last five years, revenue-wise.  They’ve doubled their staff.  But they’ve been a much more diverse group of individuals as a result of that.  And they’ve had to because the talent pools are quite tight in certain areas."
13IN,13IN_168,Q,Are there areas that are perhaps female-dominated?
13IN,13IN_169,A,"Marketing, functionally.  Digital.  Again, we’re looking at nursing, and the health sector, and education tend to be - I mean, we all know this stuff."
13IN,13IN_17,Q,Would you suggest they do some courses?  Board director courses or things like that as well?
13IN,13IN_170,Q,"Let’s imagine, let’s take one of those, marketing.  If it is female-dominated, if the quota was 50% females, 50% males, do you think that might have a benefit because it brings in more men?"
13IN,13IN_171,A,I’m not really in agreeance with quotas.
13IN,13IN_172,Q,Because you did say that initially.
13IN,13IN_173,A,"And, again, it comes back to the strategy of, ‘What are we trying to achieve’.  And I come at this from a recruiter’s perspective, which is around solving the problem around, ‘Where are we going as an organisation’.  And taking out anything to do with any group necessarily and bring it back to, ‘What’s going to give us the best result’.  I think overlaying that with having less bias, so if they’d been more self-aware.  A combination of the two is what gives us the best result."
13IN,13IN_174,Q,"How do you feel about these agenda targets, you’ve said that.  Is there any other kind of diversity that you think matters?  Yes, you’ve said that.  What was the situation five years ago, you’ve said that.  So I’m - finally now, looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?  And why do you think it would be good?"
13IN,13IN_175,A,I think that the diversity of Australian boards needs to be at the absolute forefront of the conversation to begin with.  There needs to be much deeper and better training and education around the commercial and economic impact that a more diverse board adds.
13IN,13IN_176,A,"And then as a result of that, in terms of what the makeup of boards looks like in 10 years compared to today, I would like to see more female participation, I would like to see greater ethnicity, more millennials.  So the traditional makeup of the board as it stands today, to look different in 10 years.  And I think that that really comes with - less about quotas, and less about, ‘We feel this is what the market’s telling us’, but much deeper appreciation for the commercial benefit and impact it has.  And therefore, as a result, we just have naturally a much more diverse group of individuals running organisations."
13IN,13IN_177,Q,So are you doing something to provide that evidence base?  Are you involved in research?
13IN,13IN_178,A,"Yeah, we are.  One of our pillars as an organisation, last year was around leadership;  this year it’s around diversity and inclusion.  We did a big piece of research last year on leadership, which actually had a really interesting link around what our leaders are looking foris a much more inclusive, vulnerable, open leadership style.  And the days of hard versus soft leadership are very different.  We are looking for soft leadership.  That’s what people want.  That’swhat they’re not getting."
13IN,13IN_179,A,"And so we think there’s a really strong correlation, if we talk about the gender conversation, that - not stereotyping female leaders, but there’s a suggestion to say that females can dial up that ability to be more vulnerable or empathetic, use the softer side of leadership.  Because there’s arguments to say that they’ve got more of that in-built in them than males.  And so - and that’s what we think the future of leadership looks like.  And males and females need to demonstrate that.  But we think there’s an opportunity for females to really dial that up."
13IN,13IN_18,A,"Yes, I think becoming a graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors is an important part of the process in terms of understanding all of the elements of what it is to be a board member, from the governance, et cetera, perspective.There’s a theory-based component that just gives people - and funnily enough, though, a lot of board directors I meet, they haven’t done the GAICD.  And so I don’t think that necessarily means that they’re not as capable or experienced or knowledgeable, but I think it is an important start for someone who’s looking to go on that journey.  Because it just gives a very good foundation about the role of a board member."
13IN,13IN_180,A,"And then going forward - so that was last year.  We will be focusing this year on more research around diversity and inclusion, the kind of impacts that that might have on businesses for the future.  I can share with you when we get to that."
13IN,13IN_181,Q,"I’ll shoot you a review article, if you’d like - it’s international - on diversity and performance.  It’s a review from last year."
13IN,13IN_182,A,"Yes.  Well, that might be an opportunity for us to get involved together, is some of the research."
13IN,13IN_183,Q,"That’s what I was thinking.  I mean, this research is being led by the professor of governance at La Trobe.  She’s amazing.  She’s overseas at the moment."
13IN,13IN_184,A,There could be a real link.
13IN,13IN_185,Q,"Yeah, we’ll stay connected."
13IN,13IN_186,A,I’ll send you the report that we did for the research we did last year on leadership.
13IN,13IN_187,Q,Be brilliant.
13IN,13IN_188,A,But this is our topic for this year.
13IN,13IN_189,Q,It’s great because it’s ours.
13IN,13IN_19,Q,And you mentioned selection committees.  How do you link your potential board candidate to a selection committee?  How would you do that?
13IN,13IN_190,A,"Yeah, so there’s opportunity for us to get involved in that together."
13IN,13IN_191,Q,"Yeah, absolutely.  It’s brilliant.  Back to the final question.  What do you think needs to happento make it look like what you want it to look like in 10 years’ time?  What needs to happen at a government level, governing institutions, industry bodies, director programs?  Individuals such as leadership coaches and head-hunters?  What needs to happen?  “No, let’s start again”.  No."
13IN,13IN_192,A,"Look, I think that this needs to continue to be a topic that we talk about.  And with that, education and evidence-based impact that more diverse boards and organisations have.  I think that that’s where it starts.  And as leaders, we need to have advocates at the chair level and at the CEO level, who are filtering that conversation down through organisations."
13IN,13IN_193,A,"That’s got to be where it starts.  It’s got to be the leaders that are open and prepared to talk about it, and to back a more diverse board or a more diverse organisation.  That’s that filtering down, and then within that there’s storytelling around the organisations that have had economic impact or have made significant change or transformation through having more diversity.  I think that’s where it looks."
13IN,13IN_194,A,"In terms of funding and the like, potentially there could be more programs out there to get more flexibility.  From a gender point of view, there’s that whole argument that we get more females through."
13IN,13IN_195,Q,"I’m thinking universities, in every subject we teach, we probably should include leadership, and then whoever’s doing the subject, whether they’re male or female or whatever, leadership is part of it.  Because I’m thinking, even if your career is research into black holes, it has an influence.  We’ve just hadthe first photograph of a black hole.  This is amazing, so leadership helps you understand how you might work as a team, how you might collaborate effectively across countries and stuff like that."
13IN,13IN_196,Q,"Maybe that would help us achieve more diversity on boards.  Because we’re thinking in terms of, ‘We can contribute through leadership, whatever our background is’.  Say if I’m a philosopher, if I’m a mathematician, I can get on a board and contribute as a leader.  Or get on a professional board.  You know what I mean?  So everyone’s thinking in terms of how they can contribute through the boards.  And so that’s, I’m thinking, a push from below.  A consumer demand sort of thing."
13IN,13IN_197,A,"Yes, yeah.  And, again, that comes back to the notion of storytelling as well.  We’re able to tell their stories around the philosopher that joined the BHP board and has had huge impact on sustainability and just ways of thinking."
13IN,13IN_198,Q,The ways of thinking.
13IN,13IN_199,A,"And that’s a great outcome for everyone.  Society, economics, and shareholder."
13IN,13IN_2,Q,"Another participant put me in contact with you because in our conversation, the issue of people who influence boards by providing services to them, helping them search, is a key factor in board diversity, and you happen to be in that space.  This is what I want to focus on with you so that’s great.  First of all, how do you build your network of potential directors that you put forward to boards?"
13IN,13IN_20,A,"A lot of what we would do would really come back to the brief, and the brief has a lot of layers to it.  The best practice elements around that might be around, really, from a matrix point of view, what’s the current makeup of the board in terms of skills and gender and experience, be it functional."
13IN,13IN_200,Q,That’s great.  Are there any final comments you’d like to make before we close?
13IN,13IN_201,A,I think that covers it.  It’s been really good insight for me too.
13IN,13IN_202,Q,I think so.
13IN,13IN_203,A,"I’d love to see a transcript.  And I think there would be a great opportunity at some point for us to talk again about what you’re doing around diversity, and how we might be able to work together to use research and our network or something to help unpack this issue.  Because we’re really passionate about it."
13IN,13IN_204,Q,"Well, I’ll put you in touch."
13IN,13IN_21,A,"Underlying that is where the organisation is at in terms of its strategy and what do they see coming up in terms of the next 12 months to three years, and so that could be digital disruption, for example, and what’s the capability of the organisation from a board perspective in areas of that type of functional or technical type of skill."
13IN,13IN_22,A,"But I think having an understanding of the current board matrix, having an understanding of the strategy, and the potential headwinds or challenges that the organisation’s facing can then help to identify what type of board members we might need to enable that organisation to move forward in the future."
13IN,13IN_23,Q,Is that one of the services - on your website you have board services.  Is analysing the board - that’s one of the things you do?
13IN,13IN_24,A,"Yes, yeah, absolutely.  And good practice around sourcing and selecting is around understanding and having a really clear understanding of what that board matrix looks like.  I mean, that’s quite a simple process to do.  Not that complex."
13IN,13IN_25,A,"But once it’s identified and you look at the board matrix structure, and you start to see the makeup of males and we’re 60 years-plus, and we’re CFOs - and we’re looking at a business that’s going through some significant transformation and change, and has been disrupted through technology or an ageing target market that might look very different - we probably need to start thinking, ‘Do we have the right board structure in place to enable the business to prosper in the future’."
13IN,13IN_26,Q,Do you work with the Chair primarily in these discussions?
13IN,13IN_27,A,"Yeah, sothat would be a natural - or the relevant selection committee member.  So a combination of the two would be where it comes from.  But I also think good practice is to have as many conversations with as many of the board as possible to be aligned and understand, ‘Are we aligned on what the organisation’s goals are, challenges, and what their future would look like in terms of new board members’."
13IN,13IN_28,Q,"There’s questions that are coming to my mind that are not on this sheet, and so I wantto pursue that because you’ve got a unique angle that we need, so I’m flying by the seat of my pants."
13IN,13IN_29,Q,"What about, if, when you’re talking to the different board members, you can see there’s a lack of diversity, and this is a potential issue, given the goals and their situation, their strategy and their situation?  How might you work that potential inertia within the board and homogeneity in the board?  And perhaps resistance to diversity?"
13IN,13IN_3,A,"Yes, indeed.  The network has been built up over many years of performing executive search assignments."
13IN,13IN_30,A,"Yeah, it’s agreat question, and there’s no easy answer.  Particularly when there are - what we have is unconscious bias in many situations, and breaking down unconscious bias is one of our biggest challenges as an executive search firm.  And it’s actually one of the challenges we face as an organisation in selecting people as well.We have to, as search professionals, be trained in how to overcome unconscious bias.  I think that it starts with the individuals.  That’s number 1."
13IN,13IN_31,Q,And can you unpack unconscious bias?
13IN,13IN_32,A,"So unconscious bias, in essence, is around the unconscious ways we naturally make decisions on people.  And we have unconscious bias towards age, towards religion, towards gender.  And so having an awareness - and there are tools and techniques to be tested on that, to understand what your potential blockers are, and then have self-awareness around that.  And then there are potential ways, techniques that we can use, to remove some of those:  removing names off resume, removing age off resumes, particularly universities that someone went to;  interests and memberships.  All those sorts of things that we naturally may have informed views on, so there’s some techniques we can use for our own individual ways to minimise that."
13IN,13IN_33,A,"But then, coming back to your point around how we might educate or share with a decision-maker, it’s not easy.  There’s case studies, there’s prior history in terms of board makeup, and examples of organisations that have been able to lead the way and transform and change.  And by providing those sorts of examples and case studies to help an individual understand why a more diverse board can have economic impact."
13IN,13IN_34,Q,"Because my reading of the literature - international literature - is that it’s inconclusive, the actual impacts.  And a lot of that is quantitative research.  The link between diversity and performance is inconclusive.  But then there’s critiques of that, which says, “That’s because the methodologies are different”.  You’ve got bodies of case studies that you use, this is interesting."
13IN,13IN_35,A,"Yes, and there are two sides to the coin.  I’m of the view that a more diverse board - and I’m not always talking about gender.  I’m talking about just how we create different levels of thinking.  And depending on what an organisation’s strategy and needs are and what the headwinds look like, it can play an important role.  It is a case-by-case example.  Quotas I don’t agree with."
13IN,13IN_36,Q,"Great, there was a question on that."
13IN,13IN_37,A,"But I think that having an appreciation for what the business’ challenges and needs and what the strategy is and aligning that to the right mix of individuals - their skills, experience, backgrounds - is the best approach."
13IN,13IN_38,Q,"It’s getting the right fit for the right time, first time."
13IN,13IN_39,A,Correct.
13IN,13IN_4,Q,How many years are we talking?
13IN,13IN_40,Q,"That aligns with a director I interviewed last week who was very entrepreneurial, and that was his idea.  Similar age, actually, probably, to you.  It’s interesting, I’m seeing the patterns."
13IN,13IN_41,Q,"I’m going to move to this so as we can start linking your data with other people.  How do you think - because you’ve been right in this space for 15 years, you can look at it for 15 years quite easily.  How has the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?"
13IN,13IN_42,A,I think we’ve seen a big shift towards more females.
13IN,13IN_43,Q,And why do you think that?
13IN,13IN_44,A,"No question there’s a view that a more diverse female - from the gender perspective - has just a different level of outcome and output and ways of thinking that create economic value to an organisation.  There’s just cases and cases where that is very clear, and so that’s probably the biggest shift that I’ve seen."
13IN,13IN_45,A,"More recently we’re starting to see more - and I’m not talking ASX necessarily, top 100, but probably more mid-sized organisations, an appreciation for age.  Millennials and Gen Y being - there is a different way of thinking, I think, that the demographics have.  And there is more of an appetite to have more millennials on boards.  It’s hard because there’s a gap in skill."
13IN,13IN_46,Q,What skill is missing?
13IN,13IN_47,A,"Well, experience.  I’ll put experience.  And there’s a perception that someone may not have - there’s a link, a perception - whether you call it an unconscious bias, again - about experience and capability, which is where I think there’s been a gap, and why there’s probably not as many millennials going onto boards."
13IN,13IN_48,Q,"I’ve interviewed a couple of people who would be entrepreneurs and start-ups, and there seems to be a view that maybe that capability might be a bounded way of thinking and being, and limiting.  That’s really challenged my preconceived ideas of diversity.  Even as a researcher, you think, ‘Right, these are the ideas garnered from the literature’ and whatever, and it was like I was being completely refreshed and reframed in these interviews.  How might you respond?  I don’t know, do you ever work with start-ups?"
13IN,13IN_49,A,Yep.
13IN,13IN_5,A,"Your Organisation has been in existence for 15 years, and so the network has been built up through many years of performing executive search assignments.  That gives the access to a pool of talent who are actively pursuing opportunities, board appointments or executive roles, because there are executives that perform executive roles as well as non-executive roles.  The pool of talent is made up of both non-exec and execs that can perform both roles."
13IN,13IN_50,Q,"How do they feel about this capability idea and experience?  I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but do they have a different view, perhaps, to your bigger organisation, more established organisation?"
13IN,13IN_51,A,"Yeah, start-ups are probably a unique example in some way because their needs might be more around investors and equity and funding, and so having big-name, experienced board members is actually more appealing."
13IN,13IN_52,Q,You would be [inaudible] 00:19:05 that's experience?
13IN,13IN_53,A,"Yeah, so probably getting back to the notion of the organisational goals.  And also having more experience - grey hair, if you like - on the board in terms of guiding businesses going through this sort of growth.  High growth is where it’s about bringing governance and structure and process, and having more experience can sometimes be a good thing.  And I think there’s an appetite that more start-up businesses might have to have more of that type of experience."
13IN,13IN_54,A,"On the reverse, though, businesses that are larger and corporates that are going through really changing dynamics from a new market or they’ve been disrupted because of technology, it probably goes in reverse, and having less - the experienced, old ways of thinking is probably an inhibitor, and hence the reason why having a more diverse millennial-style individual in a business like that could be a good thing."
13IN,13IN_55,Q,How would you explain that?  Say I’m the chair of a board who’s in that situation.  How would you explain to me that this 30-year-old person would be really good for us to have on the board?
13IN,13IN_56,A,"Well, again, coming back to the skills matrix, and coming back to the strategy, and coming back to the headwinds and what it looks like in 12 months or three years, if there’s argument to say that - if there’s a gap in that level of experience or thinking, then presenting that as an option, to review candidates that have that type of profile.  Assuming that they’ve got the commercial acumen and the financial acumen and they understand governance, et cetera."
13IN,13IN_57,A,"But I think presenting - I mean, our role is not to make the decision for organisations, but our role is to guide and coach and suggest.  And through analysis, we’re able to then provide options, and counsel an organisation as to, ‘Have you considered this type of individual’.  And then, ‘This might be an example of an organisation that’s done that and has had great benefit’."
13IN,13IN_58,Q,"Are these the case studies?  They’re from your business experience, is this the case studies that you were talking about?"
13IN,13IN_59,A,"That’s right, yeah."
13IN,13IN_6,Q,Some board members have exec experience and some don’t?
13IN,13IN_60,Q,So they’re Australian?  Because you’re an Australian business.
13IN,13IN_61,A,Correct.
13IN,13IN_62,Q,"They’re Australian, they’re situated in this culture, in this institutional environment, so they’re appropriate?"
13IN,13IN_63,A,Yes.
13IN,13IN_64,Q,"Let’s say the board saw the logic of what you’re saying, the chair and the board, but they were concerned about lack of experience.  Would you facilitate or enable them by perhaps linking them with a coaching service?  Would you do something like that?  Is that the sort of - a way you would facilitate diversity of boards?  Do you know what I mean?"
13IN,13IN_65,A,"I do, yeah."
13IN,13IN_66,Q,"So the 30-year-old might get the job, but they’re on trainer wheels, they’ve got a mentor."
13IN,13IN_67,A,"I think there’s a role, yes, and there’s a role the chair plays."
13IN,13IN_68,Q,The chair would do that?
13IN,13IN_69,A,"Yeah, I think so."
13IN,13IN_7,A,"Correct.  That’s right.  And some go through an evolution of taking on non-executive roles - whilst in an executive role - as a pathway to becoming a professional non-exec director, once they get to that stage of their career where they no longer will be an exec.  I think the pool is joined."
13IN,13IN_70,Q,It’s not your organisation?
13IN,13IN_71,A,"It wouldn’t be our organisation.  You might suggest pairing them up with someone from the AICD, or having an external coach, or the role the chair or the rest of the board plays.  And I’m not suggesting that there’s a lack of millennials on boards here.  That’s not my point here.  I mean, it would be just one of the areas that perhaps there’s a lack of understanding."
13IN,13IN_72,Q,"The kind of boards that are perhaps most diverse, we’ve got not-for-profits, for-profits.  By industry, you’ve said that the ASX 100 tend to be less diverse, is that right?"
13IN,13IN_73,A,"I mean, there’s probably anecdotal evidence to suggest that.  We do know just under 30% of the top 100 ASX are female."
13IN,13IN_74,Q,"From a gender point of view, definitely."
13IN,13IN_75,A,"Yeah, and from an age and so forth."
13IN,13IN_76,Q,"But probably the other things too.  Do you think gender diversity is a bit like - one person did say that they saw gender diversity as a signal of other kinds of diversity.  It’s measurable, so you can measure gender diversity and you can put it into graphs and disclose it, report on it.  But if a board lacks gender diversity, they’re probably likely to lack the other kinds of diversity.  Do you agree with that?"
13IN,13IN_77,A,"It’s a good question, and I don’t have the data to make that total assumption on that.  But I would suggest that’s a pretty reasonable assumption."
13IN,13IN_78,Q,A rule of thumb?
13IN,13IN_79,A,"Yeah, I think so.  And the notion of gender diversity is one that is - diversity’s an interesting whole conversation.  And organisations, whether at the exec level or the board level - because I do think it feeds down into an organisation if a board has the view that we’d be - we’ll become more diverse.  And it’s hard to tackle everything in one go, and organisations, at all levels, have probably found tackling gender is just the starting point.  And then it feeds down into some of the other areas."
13IN,13IN_8,Q,And how do you develop diversity in this pool?  Or the diversity of this pool?  Or do you?
13IN,13IN_80,A,"Because it’s just hard overnight to address every group from a diversity perspective and make change across the board.  And I think organisations that I’ve seen perhaps tackle gender as the first one, and then will start to let that flow down."
13IN,13IN_81,Q,"Why is it easier, the gender one, do you think?"
13IN,13IN_82,A,"I don’t know if it’s easier, actually.  Because if I actually think about it, there’s this issueof - in certain industries - a lack of great female executives.  Just they’ve chosen for being a mother, or career as not being their priority for a period of time.  It’s harder and there’s just less of them.  I don’t think there’s an easy on that one either."
13IN,13IN_83,Q,"But it’s clearer, you can measure it, is that the point?"
13IN,13IN_84,A,"Yeah, I think so."
13IN,13IN_85,Q,"And manage it, therefore.  Now, how important - I’ve got - 10 is extremely important.  Board diversity’s extremely important, 10, or not important at all, 1.  Where would you rate it?"
13IN,13IN_86,A,Ten.
13IN,13IN_87,Q,"And do you think it’s always been important?  Has it always been important to Australian boards?  And perhaps if I move to the next point which is, if you feel it hasn’t, what has led to the change?  The change of view that diversity is really important, extremely important to boards?  What’s led to that change?"
13IN,13IN_88,A,I think that organisations have become - they’re waking up to the fact that a more diverse board has economic impact.
13IN,13IN_89,Q,Can you give me an example of how they - what’s woken people up?
13IN,13IN_9,A,"That’s a really interesting question.  And in terms of developing diversity, if we just go back a step and we define it by other things than just gender - when we talk about age and demographics, and we talk about ethnicity, religious beliefs and a whole range of other factors - I think naturally there is just this - a great pool of individuals that have been built up that sit within a number of those different buckets.  Though, through our beliefs that a more diverse board has a greater economic impact, we actively play a role in sourcing and attracting individuals that may come from more diverse backgrounds."
13IN,13IN_90,A,"I just think that organisations have realised that with changing economies, and with changing technology, and with changing societal views, with the internationalisation, globalisation, organisations are waking up that if you don’t have a diverse board, you don’t have diverse thinking,  you don’t have diverse perspectives, you don’t have diverse views, and you become very single-minded."
13IN,13IN_91,A,"And things change very quickly, so having that level of thinking and diversity in different views from different individuals - be it ethnicity, or whether it be gender, or whether it be age - allows for much better decision-making, for much better agility, for much greater way of - for just different thinking."
13IN,13IN_92,Q,"And that’s cognitive diversity, that’s what people mean?"
13IN,13IN_93,A,Correct.
13IN,13IN_94,Q,What you’re looking for is really that improved problem-solving?
13IN,13IN_95,A,Correct.
13IN,13IN_96,Q,And so cognitive diversity is really about enabling that.
13IN,13IN_97,A,"Yes, correct."
13IN,13IN_98,Q,So this is the basis that you’re moving on?
13IN,13IN_99,A,"The outcome is the economics, but the basis is the diversity of thinkingand the notion of cognitive decision-making."
14IN,14IN_1,Q,"Good, so yes, you’re an engineer and you’re being influential or seeking to encourage women into engineering, is that correct; this is what I’ve heard, in order to get them through, or why are you doing this?"
14IN,14IN_10,Q,"Oh, that might have been it because I couldn’t find you as an author so I’m sorry I tried to-"
14IN,14IN_100,A,"Yeah, look I think you’re not going to get the change you want without some targets there."
14IN,14IN_101,Q,Because of this private at the second -
14IN,14IN_102,A,"Yeah, you won’t. And I was having a conversation with someone last night and this is about trying to get more pilots to be women and there was a positive description towards women. And he said, “Well think about that, someone with the lowest score got in.” And I said, “Well 50 years ago, it was the opposite that women who could have done it, didn’t get in even though they had better scores and now it’s the opposite.” It’s going to bounce out and when we get there, there’s going to have to be a correction. So,unfortunately, they go, “Yeah right, just okay. “You think about the long-term, it’s a long-term, we’re not talking about today and tomorrow, we’re talking about trying to make a correction and once people are in there, more people will want to be in; but you’ve got to get them in there in the first place and we’re going to need that positive thing to get -"
14IN,14IN_103,Q,"So, how do you think the culture, this dare I say, the token, the risk of tokenism, how might that then affect the culture of oh well this could be the cockpit fit and we’re really looking at boards. If that is the perception, you’re here because you’ve ticked a box."
14IN,14IN_104,A,Just have to get over it.
14IN,14IN_105,Q,"[inaudible] 00:37:55 have to get over it, the board or both."
14IN,14IN_106,A,"Both I think. We’re just going to say, there’s going to be some backflak from it. We’re looking at the longer-term benefit. People always have that for you. They could be right or could be wrong and there’ll be some good highs and some bad highs but that’s what we have now, isn’t it really. I think that’s an excuse not to take some action. I hear that argument, that’s fine you can have that argument, but I don’t think that’s a reason not to go ahead. Maybe, some of the targets to me seemed a little bit too big. I think just moderate, maybe go 50% but maybe you’ve got 10, 20 or 30 is not a bad target."
14IN,14IN_107,Q,"Yeah. But with targets, do you think there’s some things that can’t be measured that matter? Because targets imply you can measure them, you can say 30% or 40%."
14IN,14IN_108,A,"Oh, well that’s always the case, isn’t it?"
14IN,14IN_109,Q,"Yeah, but there are things that you’ve been talking about that are really hard to measure."
14IN,14IN_11,A,"It’s all right, it’s fine."
14IN,14IN_110,A,"Oh yeah, a lot. Well I mean there’s a lot of – look the biggest issue with 50% on boards is that there are not 50% of executives who are women, so it’s just a very difficult pull to select from. If you’ve only got 10% of executives are women, and you want 50% on the boards -"
14IN,14IN_111,Q,"Yeah, do the maths. I’m really going back to this what you’ve said about your experience which is just because we’ve had the technological revolution, we don’t have secretaries except for maybe the CE. We all run from our mobiles, from our laptops, and whatever and so you miss the support."
14IN,14IN_112,A,There’s no support in business now.
14IN,14IN_113,Q,"Yeah, so this could be an invisible glass ceiling."
14IN,14IN_114,A,"I think it is. I think you’ll hang around but you won’t be able to go to the next level because the way you succeed more in the mantra is you go out for dinner; you’re catching up in the corridor; you’re making those other connections; you might be at some business dinner and you can’t, it’s just very hard to do that when you’ve got kids. And also, if I think on it being one of the reasons I finally resigned from Exxon is I coined the term I was diarising toilet breaks and it was so busy; and even then, and I’m busier now I’d say but I thought I was busy then. And I remember, it was one weekend anyway, I was so busy, someone left the front door open, one of the children wandered down the street; I justwasn’t there, and I go, Joan try to do all this and it’s my safety with the kids and they keep talking about that you’re not talking to your kids. We can have some social mess up. It’s really interesting to know and that’s why I just think, gosh I don’t know how to advise women going through it right now, if they have kids and stuff. I go, I did it and I think I did it pretty well but -"
14IN,14IN_115,Q,"Yeah, there was a bit of luck maybe."
14IN,14IN_116,A,"I think so. My kids are pretty good. I was lucky they’re pretty healthy and the kids were okay, but I hear some terrible stories of really difficult children who just need a more present parent all the time and that’s not that it worked every time."
14IN,14IN_117,Q,"That’s right. And the extended family thing, because of our -"
14IN,14IN_118,A,"It’s so limited, yeah, that’s right."
14IN,14IN_119,Q,"- where it’s a global community, you spend a lot of your time overseas. So, you’re not where your parent – you know, there’s not the parents to call on or siblings that might have come in 50 years agoif and when we’re trying to do it. Yeah, so,that’s reallygood to bring that into my head but I think the technological part of it and no secretaries, that is across the board, across all industries and that is the factornow, who does that impact more?"
14IN,14IN_12,Q,"Yeah, well that’s what she was meaning. And so, she said that you would be really useful to our project because you could shed some light on how you’ve been trying to increase the number of women in engineering getting through to senior management experience in order that they can have a go of boards in this industry."
14IN,14IN_120,A,"I think its women, I think it is because often, and especially single women, even worse so because -"
14IN,14IN_121,Q,It’s impossible.
14IN,14IN_122,A,"Yeah, so maybe and I’m single now, I’ve been ten years but guys, maybe they know so much because they’ve got someone sometimes at home keeping an eye on them and checking on this, you’ve just got nothing. You’re just going, no one is thinking about you in any capacity. Sometimes I go, really."
14IN,14IN_123,Q,"Yeah, it’s really hard. I see it’s a hard call, like you can’t advise, but anyway, you’ve been a role model and you can share your experience."
14IN,14IN_124,A,"Yeah. Look I think the workplace is much better for women and people behave better, they talk to each other with more respect. Because I’ve heard over a meeting with all guys in there and they’re shouting at each other. And then I open the door, going, “Is there a problem here?”“Oh, no this is how we talk.” I said, “Well do you mind not. This is not very good to me. Only just quieten down and just have a bit,” so, I think people do behave better and that’s a good thing."
14IN,14IN_125,Q,"That’s funny. So, what do you see the main barriers to building diverse boards?"
14IN,14IN_126,A,"Well it is a pipeline and I think it’s the experience. If you’ve never worked with another woman on the board or had – half these guys probably haven’t worked for a male boss or a female boss or something like that, it’s just a change and it’s how prepared they are. Women are very busy to take that on. I remember onetimeI was trying to employ a new scheduler or something and there were two applied and it was within the company and it was a guy and a girl. I remember thinking at the time, both of them were quite capable; the girl probably would actually be more capable but she needed a bit more training and I had no time to train; and I go, “I’ve got no time, I’m going to have to select him because he’s done half the job anyway,” and you can hit the ground running, even though I knew it would be great but I’ve got no spare capacity. And I do think again the way the workplace is, there’s this thing, well we’ll train them up, it doesn’t happen. So, if people aren’t already got experience, even though we talk about you can cross into it, because people can adjust, but the pace just I think it takes time"
14IN,14IN_127,Q,"That’s come out in other interviews, the pace has but not the implications for the pipeline. So, that’s really interesting. It sounds awful."
14IN,14IN_128,A,"I know and yes it does, it’s just seems it’s going to be hard work."
14IN,14IN_129,Q,"Yeah, I don’t want to get you into a stress. So, has this pace increased say over the last five years; is there a turn?"
14IN,14IN_13,A,"Yeah. And look, it’s complex at every level but one example I did, for a while there I actually worked in Melbourne University and so what I decided to do was trying to get more post graduate women back into university sector and lecture positions. Andwhat I do is try and create a scholarship because you know most graduates are always desperate for money and then they want to keep doing study or do a scholarship. But I said, “Well I’m not going to do a single scholarship.” I’m not having some poor woman there just by herself. I’m only going to put the scholarship up if I can get three women; that they can actually, once you’re there, you can actually then learn from each other and have a voice. And so, I think that’s very important in women. If you just put a token of women in there, theydon’t have a voice and you only then attracting women who want to act and behave like everyone else, so what’s the point. And I think one of the books that really informed me was of that Amanda Sinclair’s one: Doing Leadership Differently. And I thought about that quite heavily when I was at Melbourne University. And she said there’s four stages of getting women into leadership. And the first stage is where people are; it depends where people are at as to how you take them to the next stage."
14IN,14IN_130,A,"Yeah, I’d say, definitely from the last ten years and up to now, it’s still just getting faster. And look I think I’ve changed from I’ve always been on the client- and I’m on the services-side now; it’s the first time, which is almost never heard of. You normally don’t go from one, you’re always on the client-side of the services. But the wayengineering has changed is all the work I’m doing now, would have be done on the client-side when I first started work. So, you’d have all your engineers in with Exxon or even with BP. What they’ve decided is well, they want to cut costs, so they move it out to a lower-cost provider, and we provide internal services into these companies. So, it’s a change of the model but it means there is no downtime really; whereas I suppose in a client-side you produce something over a year, and you might stop, and you celebrate and you make money for the goods. We’re a labour hire company so you only make money when the people are working. So, you don’t stop for an hour for lunch. You make 10% on the whole time. So, if you stop working, your business goes down. It’s a very different model. I think the site’s pretty busy."
14IN,14IN_131,Q,When did that happen?
14IN,14IN_132,A,"Look I think it’s been over the last say 15, 20 years. It started mainly in engineering when they couldn’t handle the unions, the companies and so they said, “Oh, we’re outsource another company, we’d have a new set of union agreements and that’s the only way we’re going to get those rates down by stopping and hiring them and getting this other company,” so that’s where it started from. Anyway so, I’m digressing again."
14IN,14IN_133,Q,"No, but this is giving me a sense of the pace, and over ten years. So, the model has to be sensitive to context and not everyone’s been around in one industry from this long and actually like to the level that you understand it. So, it’s wonderful even though,this is that part of industry, but there will be similar things happening in others; like the like financial industry to keep the global financial crisis. I mean, we’ve got these moments that are challenged and watershed moments that have changed things. Do you feel that you put on there – yes you did but you talked about that so we can move on; do you feel that diversity not really seem to be important? That’s all right. From a regular true perspective, we’ve talked about gender targets, and quotas and we’ve talked about what was the situation five years ago, you’ve told me about that. So, finally, because I’m aware we’ve got - looking ten years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards? And then I’m going to ask why you think it will be good and what do you think needs to happen for that to occur?"
14IN,14IN_134,A,"Look I’d like to see that unit - every board is at least 30%. I don’t know if it needs to be 50, but I think -"
14IN,14IN_135,Q,Of female?
14IN,14IN_136,A,"Yeah. But it’s also, there’s more diversity than just gender. I think racial diversity and cultural diversity is important."
14IN,14IN_137,Q,"So, are you measuring those as well."
14IN,14IN_138,A,"Look essentially, I thought on here I’d have a - I seeif we talk about gender diversity, I go, I’ve never had such a racially or culturally diverse group and I want to just find out which countries are represented. I think it’s fascinating. And I don’t know whether to measure it as a target, but I think it’s interesting. I love what it means. I love having conversations with people about how you’d go about doing it in different cultures and so it just brings ideas into it. Is there another way of handling it and I think people are not very good at doing that; so, for example, we talk in a big company typically when someone leaves, you might do an exit interview and I said, “Why the hell don’t people do entry interviews?” I’m fascinated. You start at a new company and you start. They don’t go, “Can we just download everything that you’ve done and understood so we can learn from that?” They don’t. And I go, “Why wouldn’t you?” So, I remember I was doing some work with Exxon and we had to do a transfer with Shell, and I said, “Has someone in this business worked in Shell before?” And they go and found this guy and I said, “Hey, come here. I need to do this can you tell me what goes on down there, so I know what to?”“Yeah we did,” and he said, “Oh you shouldn’t do that.” And I said, “What do you mean,” you know, got all the information but it just meant I’ve got this resource that you should use."
14IN,14IN_139,A,"And one other example, and actually I was trying to get more diversity at Melbourne University Engineering Faculty. And I also was trying to engage students to enjoy the cultural diversity in their teams because they’re always doing teamwork. Now typically you think back your hand because if they were from Asia, you couldn’t understand, their English wasn’t very good, and I don’t want to have them in the group. And I said to the lecturers, I said to one, “Look you need to design your projects thatencourages diversity in the teams because they can’t get the answers unless they’ve got some from Malaysia. Don’t just do it about building the equipment, ask about the labour relations and how we going to source the team of people. So, if you’ve got to build a windfarm in Malaysia, and say well how we going to then run your labour rules and stuff and then the guys in the team who are from Australia, are going to want the Malaysian guy in because they can’t answer the question.” And the answer I got from the lecturers, “I can’t do that, because I don’t know the answer.”"
14IN,14IN_14,A,"And so, I used that for what I did at university sector, I said, “Okay, if you’re at the first phase, there’s no point of me engaging with you with my ideas of someone who’s maybe at the fourth stage, because (one) you lose them; and (two), it’s a bit disrespectful;” because not everyone is informed about a particular topic of someone else. So, if I’m talking to a medical guy, he’s not going to talk to me about high order stuff and it’s not that I’m not capable of understanding it’s just I’m not informed. So, I think there’s a respect about the diversity agenda. So, the first phase they say is about that there isn’t a problem. So, some people go, well it’s not a problem. Why are we even working through that? So, with that, I would present data and start to show data. So, if they’re at that phase then let’s just move them onto the next stage and present the data. The next phase is well, oh okay, all right, I believe the data, could you just get some women who act and think like men and just put them in there? And then I tick my boxes and that’s great and then we’ll get that number in. So, they go, okay, I have a problem but gee, can I just get some like-minded men that look and aren’t like women and get them and that’s fun."
14IN,14IN_140,Q,"I’m sorry that’s a scream they’re teaching. So, let’s try and what would the analogous situation on a board, does that transfer to a board?"
14IN,14IN_141,A,"I think the analogous thing is if you just had the quota and you’ve put them in there and you don’t, you’re not interested in that perspective that they bring, you’re wasting your time. It is disrespectful. Like I had a meeting, I was here, and I was the only woman in there and they started talking about how to get more women in? And they all talked; not one of them paused to say, “[Participant] what’s your view?”"
14IN,14IN_142,Q,And here you are.
14IN,14IN_143,A,"And after a while I’d like to say something, I go, they all had a view, “Why would you have a view before you’ve asked me,” like really,I was fascinated. And then one of them, the other one said, “Oh I had two who are pregnant and I couldn’t keep them because they haven’tgot car parks at work and so they couldn’t, you know, if they wanted to leave quickly and it was too hard to get to work.”I said, “Bloody get a car par. Why can’t you provide those services? If I had someone who was pregnant here, we’ve got three parks, can’t we just release a car park for her so that whilst she’s coming in here, she’s or when she comes back?” Because they don’t, they won’t differentiate because then it’s not fair anyway."
14IN,14IN_144,Q,"Oh yeah, I’ve had that thinking."
14IN,14IN_145,A,"Sorry, so coming back to boards, I think it comes back to leadership and it’s just different ways of thinking, isn’t it?"
14IN,14IN_146,Q,"Okay, can I justask you something; I haven’t thought it through, it’s not coming from the literature, but it’s coming from bits and pieces that I’ve picked up from people. The pipeline implies a mechanical line.Now what if, getting onto boards is not so hierarchical in ten years’ time; what if its more organic? Is it possible; is that something advantageous? Potentially, can you get there?"
14IN,14IN_147,A,"Look when I did the AICD course I thought, why does the course not then put you as a ghost person on every board? To me it seemed obvious. So, you need experience. Why don’t all the big boards have two people, you don’t get paid, you sit there."
14IN,14IN_148,Q,"Yeah, you’re observers, and you learn, and you can ask questions."
14IN,14IN_149,A,"Yeah and maybe later on they can source that person and they’re a while so, how many positions would that be? So, I don’t know why they just don’t; those positions aren’t available, and it should be part of doing the AICD course; it should be to get people then have you shadow a board for six months or something."
14IN,14IN_15,A,"So, you start to get more women I suppose at that point and then as the next group, they go okay, and then the women start getting together and they’re going, yeah, but you’re not actually supporting us. Then they might go to their CEO and say, “Well that’s fine but we’ve actually other needs.” And they go, okay, I acknowledge that. Can you goform a woman’s group over there and can you go and just decide what you want, and we’ll give you some money and just do whatever makes you happy there. So, (one) we now know it’s there, we know women need a bit extra but please don’t bother me with it, just sort it out amongst yourselves. And then the fourth maybe, hopefully it’s more, is the culture is such that women just want to be in there. You don’t actually have to have scholarships to get them in there; you don’t have to have a diversity agenda to get them in there, it just happens. It’s just natural. It just feels like they’re naturally meant to be there and that’s obviously where you want to get to. I guess in my study and thinking about it, I go, it just doesn’t happen by itself."
14IN,14IN_150,Q,"Yeah, that is really good and manage conflict of interest."
14IN,14IN_151,A,"Yeah, the legality or whatever the job."
14IN,14IN_152,Q,"Yeah, exactly and if you’re on a board that’s a competitor with you, obviously just don’t shadow on their board."
14IN,14IN_153,A,"That’s right exactly or greater, you know, they have, what do they call alter directors and have all these rules and stuff and just call it a substitute director; or you could have a role for six months or something because you’re meant to audit the board every so often and all these things; they can get you to do a project or something."
14IN,14IN_154,Q,"Yeah, and it will be useful. So, I guess, because if the pipeline is so much part of your thinking, the way you frame it, is it necessary for people to have all this experience before they go; is it just because of the tall poppy syndrome; or do you think it’s something deeper, it is really necessary that people have quite a lot more experience to be on a board?"
14IN,14IN_155,A,"Look, I think experience, but I could be, because I’ve now got experienceand I just know that I can see issues quite differently. Maybe when you’re younger and got less experience, you see issues differently again, which is still valid. And I think it’sagain about leadership and saying, “I want to have young and more experienced.” Because young people aren’t hampered by things they’ve tried before, and it didn’t work. And so that is a valid way of energizing groups. And so, I think it’s about again, good leadership to explain the benefits and all of those things. So, I think that is the combination of it. But it’s again, what is the role of the board?"
14IN,14IN_156,Q,"Yeah, well that’s it, that sort of comes back then and it’s functioning, how much mentoring can go on; how much support? Like you’re legally liable for, responsible for things that you’re accountable."
14IN,14IN_157,A,"Yeah, I mean, if you have to be responsible or signing off on all the balance sheets and things, well it’s not very respectful to give it to someone who’s not seen that; but they can’t, they haven’t seen lots of numbers through, they haven’t seen the meaning of numbers so it’s hard. I think, its interesting when I the AICD course, there was a lot of, there’s a bias towards accountants and lawyersand so that’s fine. I think therefore a lot of women who get into boards who’ve got those two qualifications. I’ve got strategy and stuff, but we’ve sat in, we had to do this role play and there was an accountant there and lawyer and we had to say what were the first three issues that were important, or this particular one had a safety issue which I’m across. And so, I said, “Look I think weshould look at safety issues.” They said, “Oh no, but we’re insolvent and the accountants can only think this.” And I said, “Okay, but you need to include that in there.” And we had to nominate someone who would be the fill-in chair and someone or someone else."
14IN,14IN_158,A,"Anyway, this woman they nominated, I don’t know her from Adam anyway, “The law taught in it that it’s all about your fiduciary duty and the fact that you’re meant to include everyone’s ideas.” So, I’m trying to say a couple of things, but anyway this woman spoke 00:57:55 but anyway and everyone deferred. And I said, “Here we are, we’ve just done four weekdays training and we’re sitting in here and you’re not listening to everyone.” I thought it was interesting but anyway I came back and was talking to a girlfriend, and I said, “It’s fascinating, just in the course, trying to give a view in, they defer it to us; you know it’s almost as if she was famous.Okay, maybe she is.” I look her up and she’s a sport star on TV. And I go, isn’t that funny. Oh my God, this human nature, we’re just at the training, so anyway."
14IN,14IN_159,Q,That’s funny. I mean it could be a famous footballer and I wouldn't recognise
14IN,14IN_16,A,"People might argue about, oh that’s unnatural forcing numbers. Yeah, okay, but you never going to – I don’t believe you get to that final stage unless you make those things happen. So, I guess your question was, how have I informed that in some other places and in the university thing I informed that. I said I’m going to get three people in if I’m going to do a scholarship. I want to give them the strength in numbers. Where I worked typically, there have been very few men and I haven’t actually been bothered by that, I enjoy -"
14IN,14IN_160,A,"No, well I didn’t know anyway, I didn’t know so she’s some, on TV and stuff like I didn’t recognise her. But I just go, it’s just that people behave like all the guys are like this you know, and I go, really, so anyway, there you go. But I think we can do a lot more about getting people on boards just to shadow them around and give people confidence and others; and it should be so hard but there’s so many different types of boards. The other thing I’ve seen for women is the way you get onto boards is you dovolunteer fornot-for-profit or something; and I go, “Then none of my skills are there though; All my skills are in the paid job.” I don’t know about marketing and all that sort of thing so why would I want to do that? And I am annoyed at that, and I’m going, “Guys don’t have to do that path, why do I have to go for a not-for-profit when not with other skills, all my skills are there.”"
14IN,14IN_161,Q,"So, your skills are, but I thought you said strategy but only with industry."
14IN,14IN_162,A,"Yeah, okay just strategy in that or strategy anyway. But most of them when they’re looking for that, they’re looking for people for fundraising in not-for-profit, they just need to bring money in. I mean, that’s what they want to bring in money and look I don’t mind doing that, but I’m actually much better in my experience."
14IN,14IN_163,Q,Yeah and in a field
14IN,14IN_164,A,"In a paid board yes. But they just want their guiding women that how you get in, they don’t guide men that way, but anyway."
14IN,14IN_165,Q,How do they guide men?
14IN,14IN_166,A,Well you just go through mates and just get onto a board; it’s through the network.
14IN,14IN_167,Q,And there’s not enough women in these boards.
14IN,14IN_168,A,"No. When you look at it, it really doesn’t matter I suppose, it’s just a different pathway."
14IN,14IN_169,Q,"Oh it does matter, because there’s someone like you with - what I really like because I thought this young women really articulated it so beautifully, she wants to be fulfilled and she wants to do, it has to work for her as well. And I thought, she’s right and basically, you’re sort of, you want experience -"
14IN,14IN_17,Q,Very few men?
14IN,14IN_170,A,"Yeah and I’m glad we’ve had this conversation because I just started this job six months ago and okay, I thought I’ll give myself a year and then I’m going to start looking for board positions again when I feel I’ve got this one in control again."
14IN,14IN_18,A,"Oh, few women, sorry. No, very sorry, thank you."
14IN,14IN_19,Q,"Yeah, that’s all right."
14IN,14IN_2,A,"Well I think it’s a fabulous career to start with, but equally, having a diverse workforce, especially in gender, to say it’s essential, a better dimension and just a nicer place to work; it works better. And a lot of women can do it. It gives people a permission to be themselves a lot more. I think when they see there’s different types of people. A lot of guys have a lot of characteristics that they could exhibit if they knew others were understanding of it. So, I think once you get more women sometimes, they go, oh, yeah, well I can act like that too or argue or have different views. And so, I think it’s very healthy around here."
14IN,14IN_20,A,"So, very few women and so I’m used to working with men, I can’t see the difference; because I’m looking out to the world and no one looks that different to me, it’s only if I was sitting in their shoes, so that’s fine. It was only when I was working at Sugar later on, there was bit of a more marketing and the more women there. Sometimes a group of us will go out for dinner and I’ll have so much fun and I go, oh my goodness, there’s another conversation that I was never having when I was just with guys. And not that I didn’t enjoy that conversation, but there’s another one to be had. And that’s really good too. So, I think sometimes you just don’t realise and you go, oh, I can talk about different things and I can see the world a bit differently; and I can see some subtleties that I can’t have if I don’t have that conversation as well. So, I think part of women supporting other women is then to understand a bit about themselves and how they relate to the workplace, I think is important."
14IN,14IN_21,Q,"Oh, it’s so interesting so the bounded experience can mean you’re blind until you -"
14IN,14IN_22,A,Oh yeah. You think I got through and what’s the issue but there was no problem.
14IN,14IN_23,Q,"Yeah, or you just not aware as you said. You happen to be in an industry that’s mainly men and so that part of you that wasn’t been exercised, you just weren’t aware of until you worked somewhere else. So, the men then, would be equally unaware, it’s not malicious or intended. It’s just as it is, so it’s that institutionalisation of this, it’s entrenched. So, if I understand these shifts, so you’ve got like the band-aid support for that and then it’s like a cultural transformation that’s the final one. But there’s mutual awareness and respect, engagement with different points of view; so that’s sort of your -"
14IN,14IN_24,A,"Yeah it is, and it takes a very experienced leader to pull out those different thoughts."
14IN,14IN_25,Q,"Yeah, and possibly a trajectory of change. So, now we’re going to focus on boards, but this is to understand. You’ve explained how you see diversity in the different stages so that underpins, which is really great. So, your role, what you do here in your job now, and when you were talking in that book, when you were being recorded in that book or whether you wrote a chapter or whatever, how are you trying to influence, apart from the university sector, now back in industry, how were you trying to influence or how do you try and influence women here so as they in the organisation?"
14IN,14IN_26,A,"Look it’s always probably been about being the role model, so, to be much more comfortable in being a woman. Because I understood that I would subjugate really your femininity when you’re younger, and not that there was a problem with it, but I just felt that’s what you did. And I’m appointed because I’m the best at the job, not because I’m a female; and we all had that rhetoric. And it only changed one time when it was sort of a social gathering and there was a glass ceiling and everything and I remember this guy, he comes in and he’s a marking person and we’re talking about this and he goes, “[Participant], I am so pissed.” And I go, “What are you on about?” He said, “Marketing is about apoint differentiation. You spend millions of dollars to get a quantitative differentiation and you have it and you’re not capitalising on it. You, how lucky are you because there’s so few women just,” I go, well of course. It’s about changing that lens going, people spend millions to be differentiated. Here you are trying not to be. It’s the most stupid thing I’ve ever heard."
14IN,14IN_27,A,"And so, it’s about sort of celebrating it I suppose and thinking how lucky I am. And so, I think it’s that sort of lens. So, then to create it in a culture around you, that is more lively and fun to be in because women will always vote with their feet typically, quicker than guys. So, whenever you’re in a workforce, it’s always the women who are leaving more often because if they’re not happy, there’s personal circumstances, there might be two workers, and they go, I don’t have to put up with this. And they will leave. And they’re also much more sensitive to poor leadership, I think. A lot of colleagues of mine doing brilliant in a company, change of boss and are very sensitive to poor leadership. They do not, won’t accept being treated badly and they’ll leave. So, what is my mantra? It’s about I guess being authentic yourself and then giving permission for others to be like that. But I probably do; I focus particularly on women or men; I try to treat them all the same I guess, in a sense that I think guys could perform better by being a bit more authentic and open and try to get information from them."
14IN,14IN_28,A,"I think I’m sort of quite good at letting everyone have a voice and so, therefore I find my victims come, so I usually have a good source of information. So, if I have good information, I can make good decisions and I’ve got to have a group of how many who trust me enough to let me know what’s going on. So, now, I’ve mentored women in mining and others; I talk to them about more issues and just about finance issues and then try to ask other questions about how they’re going to do with the families and kids and part-time work and all these things. So, I’m very happy to have conversations with them, more than just their work situation too."
14IN,14IN_29,Q,"Yeah. Have any of these women that you’ve mentored, have they positions on boards at the moment?"
14IN,14IN_3,Q,"So, good problem-solving skills then too."
14IN,14IN_30,A,"Look, you come and go, you don’t know what happens. But there’s a lady I was mentoring and she’s now GM in mining or EMG. There’s another girl we catch up with and she’s on a board, I think. So, different people are at different times, yeah. Look and I thinkI’m still not clear about the pathway and the right time that someone should get on a board. So, times when I’ve been not working, I’ve looked, oh maybe it’s a good time to get on a board but I think that timing is quite difficult to know when it is. Because sometimes when you’re full on, it’s like a 12-hour day job, it’s very hard to know when you can get enough time to work on a board so I’m still struggling with those sorts of issues."
14IN,14IN_31,Q,"Yeah. Well I just interviewed a 28 year old girl who’s on a board and she said that her proprietary step was to be an advisor in an advisory capacity to a board and not-for-profit and her employer, like her manager, she had to negotiate a conflict of resources, time and whatever.  Although the meetings were held before work, they could go a bit late and all that sort of stuff. So, that was a problem for her. So, I hear what you’re saying. Do you think women or a particular demographic, younger people, women, any of these demographics, different industries, do you think it’s harder in terms of this perceived conflict between commitment and resources? If you go and work on a board, attend six meetings a year or eight meetings a year, and that might be seen as in conflict with your work commitment?"
14IN,14IN_32,A,"Look it could be. I mean, I think good employers now should support that because I think at the end of the day, the more connected you are in with the new business and the networks and more externally I think you add more value. I think some people have - some CEOs and GMs might have their mind made up in that space and you probably can’t change it. I think some younger ones who are a bit more forward-thinking, fit, encourage that. I know a CEO and he wanted me on the boards, but his next CEO level just had that view that he couldn’t be whereas he would have supported me because he felt it was the right thing to do. So, I think it depends on different people at the end of the day, than just principles. And I had another CEO work for mining and he always made sure in any contracts he wrote for people, that they were never excluded from working on a board because he felt - and he was specifically trying to support women in that way and said that they should try and get on boards here. He’s very good."
14IN,14IN_33,Q,And he was on boards?
14IN,14IN_34,A,"Yeah, he’s a CEO of a company."
14IN,14IN_35,Q,"And so, did he mentor people onto boards?"
14IN,14IN_36,A,"Yes, a lot. He’s brought his company secretary; he’s brought a woman on there. No, he’s been very influential and proactively getting people, which is great."
14IN,14IN_37,Q,"So, that was through writing contracts."
14IN,14IN_38,A,"Yeah. So, he made sure on the contracts that they weren’t ever prescriptive, that they couldn’t – so make sure that you have the groundwork. So, makes me that whenever I sign the contract for a job, I look at it and make sure that it is open; and I’ll always have a conversation with them saying,“Look I am looking at boards and how is that thought through? And I think if someone said no, I would be maybe inclined not to take a job."
14IN,14IN_39,Q,"Why, what does that say to you?"
14IN,14IN_4,A,"A whole lot of things. It’s just, I think good decision-making needs lots of different ways to look at a problem but also, having good empathy helps you come to better decisions. And often that empathy is limited to your experience. So, if you have more people with lots more experience, you naturally create to that group empathy and it’s much greater."
14IN,14IN_40,A,"Well it says to me that they’re just not very visionary really. And where I’m in my career, I’m looking at that service not supporting where I want to go."
14IN,14IN_41,Q,"Yeah, so it’s a good test. What about someone who’s young, what do you think about them being on boards?And you know, their contracts and whether we can apply the same kind of organisational procedures to someone at the lower levels of management, you know, entry level to your speaking about senior levels and executive."
14IN,14IN_42,A,"Yeah, look I think it’s all possible. I think what might stop you is having a boss who’d be jealous. Because at the moment they may perceive that there’s more opportunity for women to get onboards because of this. But I want to get on boards and I’m not getting selected and you are; it will be a problem."
14IN,14IN_43,Q,"Oh, so you think this might be a barrier for women."
14IN,14IN_44,A,"Oh yeah, younger; if someone’s 28 going, well she was on a board at 28, why do you think - I think it would be - most people who are supportive of othershave often done that themselves, unfortunately, it just comes with nature."
14IN,14IN_45,Q,"Yeah. And that’s whether it’s a male, or a female that, will I call it a tall poppy?"
14IN,14IN_46,A,"Yeah, I think so."
14IN,14IN_47,Q,You haven’t done the work.
14IN,14IN_48,A,And I think you exactly need more and therefore what are you trying to do here.
14IN,14IN_49,Q,"Yeah, but it’s a bit of indignation perhaps, who are you; who do you think you are?"
14IN,14IN_5,Q,Can you give me an example of where that happened well and perhaps not well?
14IN,14IN_50,A,"Yeah, that’s right."
14IN,14IN_51,Q,"Okay, well that’s interesting."
14IN,14IN_52,A,"And this maybe also in the workplace; why you need to inform them but most contracts you do have to inform them; but you could be doing it on your weekends or out of hours. But I think the workplace contracts are such that you’re required to inform an employer. So, if you didn’t have to inform them, and they’ll see the conflict of interest, but if it didn’t and he independent advice, why would you need to inform them. And look maybe you don’t but most people do, I think. And often there is, some of them do want to one day have strategies sessions or something like that."
14IN,14IN_53,Q,"Yeah, true, they want to do the course. The board might pay for them to do the course so it’s a really good opportunity."
14IN,14IN_54,A,"The other observation I had is -boards are a very strategic tool for the CEO and the Chair, and they’ve got certain things that they need the board to support. And I guess, I spent a bit of time, I wrote a paper on looking at the effectiveness of boards and stuff when I was doing my NBA. And I always struggle with the role of the board actually; what are they going to do;what’s their effectiveness? And now if I’m the CEO and I’m a small business, I’d want a board that diversifies some of the skills I need. So, I might need someone who’s - maybe I haven’t got enough legal, so I’ll be like a legal advisor and a few things like that. So, it’s sort of a way to branch out and extend some of your capability or I might be thinking about mergers and so, who’s connected. So, I think there’s a lot of strategic intent behind the type of experience people have more so than just the diversity piece. I think that comes first typically people are strategic-driven. I think until you get real diversity in the management ranks, the boards are different; it’s just sort of an add-on really. It’s sort of like it should reflect what’s in the management really. I mean if the management don’t reflect enough women, it’s very hard to get the board there because experience comes from often."
14IN,14IN_55,Q,"Because then there’s a tension between the way the board is strategizing, and they do decisions and the management."
14IN,14IN_56,A,"Yean, I just think it’s very hard."
14IN,14IN_57,Q,"That’s interesting because there’s like, I mean the culture, a similar culture between the two seem to be important. But this is really, well I suppose it is culture because you can think of demographic diversity as being the artefacts of your -"
14IN,14IN_58,A,"Yeah, anyway it’s just another thing to think about is sort of I mean, I’m just so surprised there’s so little diversity in the management ranks. To me, there appears to be more diversity in the board ranks than I’m seeing in the executive management ranks, but anyway."
14IN,14IN_59,Q,And why do you think that?
14IN,14IN_6,A,"So, for example, I had three children [two work] 00:01:45 and when I was at Exxon, I was only the second woman to be in a senior management role, but I was the first one to be married and have kids in that role. So, I wasn’t too sure what to do; do I go for part-time work, I’ve never seen anyone else do that and how would they respond to it? And I was very fortunate that I had a boss who, and I was in the US when I had my first child and over there everyone just went back to work after six weeks. But I didn’t want to do that so I came back and he said, “Look, how about I find you a job that’s just three days a week, that’s it not mission critical, so if the kids are sick, you could actually come and go.” And I said, “Oh that will be brilliant.” But I couldn’t have thought to ask for that because I just had never seen it happen. So, he was very thoughtful and that helped me get my sort of feet back on the floor after that. And subsequent to that, every other woman who had a child that came back, and they retained them and stayed and went part-time, for that period; so that was that example."
14IN,14IN_60,A,I just think this year nowI’ve got less women around me than I did 32 years ago.
14IN,14IN_61,Q,Are they more senior positions?
14IN,14IN_62,A,"No, they’ve dropped. When I started with Exxon, 50% engineers were recruited that were women, yeah 50% 32 years ago. And everyone’s talking about the pipeline, so they were doing that years ago. And then they sort of go off to other jobs, they haven’t stayed the distance and I probably stuck it longer than most. And look this is a services industry and when I had children, I had a secretary and now you don’t. And I could not do my job now with three young children. So, I could back then at the workplace."
14IN,14IN_63,Q,"Yeah. They supported you, of course."
14IN,14IN_64,A,"It’s changed underneath me. I just am so busy that I couldn’t have done, I couldn’t have had three kids. I couldn’t do my job now. It’s getting less to me, friendly, yes you can do - people work from home more often but it’s not the job."
14IN,14IN_65,Q,You keep your mobile with you all the time.
14IN,14IN_66,A,"And the whole thing of work, is you’re engaging with people and you actually face-to-face. You can talk about flexibility but it’s not, you’re not very good when you’re not at work. You’re okay, you can do it occasionally, but you’re not going to change the world doing that."
14IN,14IN_67,Q,"No, it’s not the people stuff. Oh, very interesting. Because I was going to say, this only came out on Wednesday, did you see the Australian Institute of Company Directors Report on broad gender diversity and they were expecting it to reach the 30% target and it hasn’t. And so, it’s been a surprise, a bit of a shock and I was wondering why? Because these targets have been around for a long time and these boards don’t even have anyone on them. Now, if your observation that the number of women have declined, that’s the pipeline, has declined, then is this - I’m going to interview them and see if they -"
14IN,14IN_68,A,"Yes, I think that’s partly. So, I was made redundant about a year ago before I started this job. And I thought okay, engineer, lots of skills, done everything. The recruiters were excruciatingly brutal and just – every time I left, they interviewed me as if they just want you to be like a man. And they are the ones that select you, get you infront of the companies. And I thought, okay, I’m redundant now but I’m glad I’m a woman, because they need lots. But no one was asking. I’m so surprised there was so little interest. If people are really out there trying to do it, they - and I went to a few companies directly, and they just, I don’t know, they just not interested or not taking the time to think it through. So, I think people are just paying lipservice they’re not seriously seeking people. Because I’m just thinking if you’ve go on to LinkedIn and say right, I want a senior engineer, we need to get more women, why wouldn't you just get contacted all the time."
14IN,14IN_69,Q,"Yeah, exactly with your experience. It’s not like you were an entry level."
14IN,14IN_7,A,"But then fast forward, five or so years, I’ve got one of the guys that work for me and he was trying to start up another sort of side business and I said, “Oh so do you want to work part-time for a while?You know, you’ve got other interests, just some people do it for kids.”And he goes, “Gee, that would be awesome.” I said, “Well I don’t want to lose you and we can work that through, so just work part-time, I’m okay with that.” So, there’s a whole lot of things that you’re just accommodating for."
14IN,14IN_70,A,"Yeah, and look maybe I’m not the right mould, but look I think extensively I tick most boxes. So why is that, I don’t know."
14IN,14IN_71,Q,"Yeah. So, the recruitment agency might have a -"
14IN,14IN_72,A,Filter out. They filter that. It’s a brutal experience. I guess their reputation is on the line and would they be prepared to take the risk.
14IN,14IN_73,Q,"So, you think they think there is a risk in that a female eventually versus a male."
14IN,14IN_74,A,"Yeah, because if you’re given a brief, you’re only going to give a brief for someone you’ve had before. You see you can’t brief for a skillset that you have never used in your business. So, the brief is I want someone who I’ve seen before which is a man."
14IN,14IN_75,Q,"Okay, so it’s because there’s not enough of you. So, now you’re a rarity and therefore you’re a risk, an uncertainty, to the agency not to the industry."
14IN,14IN_76,A,"Yeah that’s right. Well, because they say I want someone who’s had all this experience in the same industry and a lot of women will have a much more tessellated career, so it doesn’t, it’s just not easy to slot into that same pro forma."
14IN,14IN_77,Q,"Okay. So, I should try and get a copy of a pro forma that they might use or where we can refer to it."
14IN,14IN_78,A,"So, I’m jumping around."
14IN,14IN_79,Q,"No that’s good. What I’ll do is I’ll tie you down, I’ll say, how important do you think it is to have a diverse board, if you were given a scale of ten to one; ten’s extremely important, one, not at all, what would you say?"
14IN,14IN_8,Q,"Yeah. Now how does this - because we’re looking at broad diversity. So, the person who suggested I speak to you, she raised it. She’s a director of a number of boards and chair of some and she mentioned you in the context of management is a barrier to diversity, or let’s say a strong determinant of the diversity onboards. So, if women don’t have the kind of management experience that is required for boards, chief executive experience or chief finance officer or something like that, then they can find it very difficult. So, she mentioned you because she said - I think I couldn’t find that there’s a book you’ve written is that right? No, anyway she mentioned -"
14IN,14IN_80,A,"Well I’ll say ten with the qualification. It depends what’s the board’s doing. If it’s an area that’s more male focused, it’s that the knowledge and the skills that our board bring is more beneficial, then I think there could be reason to be one way or the other, an allmen’sclub for example and why we’re giving women on the board and if you want to have an all men’s club, then go for it but I’d say ten."
14IN,14IN_81,Q,Yeah. And because we’re not speaking just about gender diversity either.
14IN,14IN_82,A,"No, true."
14IN,14IN_83,Q,"So, do you feel this will always be important, a diversity board, has it always been important? And what do you feel has led to the change if you think, oh no, it’s become more important?"
14IN,14IN_84,A,"Look I think diversity only works effectively if you have really good leaders and a poor leader can’t manage diversity. So, if you haven’t got a good leader, I’ll say, you don’t want a diversity because they can’t manage it."
14IN,14IN_85,Q,"Nice, okay. So, leadership is the key and leadership is not the Chair."
14IN,14IN_86,A,"No. Well I think it’s partly the Chair, CEOs, but it needs to be; you’ve got to have a good leader who can utilise the diversity. But if you don’t, if you really looking for group thing, well don’t have a diverse board. I mean, if that leader can’t lead, accept it then you might as well notbecause they’ll be more effective and they go, I want this; we’ll all say yes and then go on. Or else you have a disaffected board group and that’s not very helpful either."
14IN,14IN_87,Q,"Yeah, exactly. There’s a question made about conflict. So, your reason for thinking diversity is important, you termed it in terms of decision-making; is there anything else?"
14IN,14IN_88,A,"I think role model reflects people who visually can look at it. So, people have said to me, it’s nice to see a woman in charge because they haven’t ever had that before. So, there’s a visuality of it. Decision-making, experiences, empathy, I think it just brings other views on it."
14IN,14IN_89,Q,"Yeah, more to the tables. Do you think there is some situations where diversity might be less important; perhaps situations of higher uncertainty and risk; and can you help me to understand why you might change that priority from a ten say to a -"
14IN,14IN_9,A,"Look I think I might have been showcasing a book, talking about different [leads inaudible] 00:04:20 something like that -"
14IN,14IN_90,A,"Well it just depends. So, you might have a medical board; so, they make decisions on - so you could have gender and racial diversity, but you want more to be doctors. So, you’re already - what does diversity mean; is it by profession? So, I think it’s still filtering, and you say, and they need to have this base layer of knowledge. So, look I think, there’s so many women are as good at making hard-arse decisions as others and some guys fall over. So, I think you can’t tighten them much."
14IN,14IN_91,Q,"Yeah, exactly so, it would be. So, because of your broader understanding of diversity, the way you understand diversity, which by the way is consistent with almost everyone I’ve interviewed, which is nice, then it’s not an issue. Could you explain to me how you seek to influence the priority that Australian boards give to diversity and the capacity of boards to build diversity?"
14IN,14IN_92,A,"It only would be more at a personal level that if I know someone like I know this guy who’s on a mining board and I said, “Look if I come across people, some women who I think are really good,” and said, “If you ever need to get some women on the boards, I know who I would recommend.” So, I think it’s about saying to people and giving ideas to people who can move around and offer that role. But also done – I think it’s supporting leaders I supposeor look I haven’t done a lot specifically in that space."
14IN,14IN_93,Q,Were the women in the workforce that you’ve been working with.
14IN,14IN_94,A,"Yeah, and look I’ve got friends who are on boards and stuff like that. So, you talk about the issues and you support people. So, I’ve encouraged a couple of my girlfriends to do the AICD course and I’ve done that, and they’ve enjoyed it. So, a girlfriend, [Jo Mercer] 00:35:04 and she should get onto boards, so we’ll get her onto boards at some point, but she needs the AICD course I think before then. So, I guess what I’m trying to do is make sure they’ve got those qualifications so probably half a dozen I’ve encouraged to do that course. Because I think it’s saying that you’ve got the qualifications, don’t let that discount you and then think about the network from there."
14IN,14IN_95,Q,"So, gender diversity has been [Participant]ated for a while, how do you feel about the recent inclusion of ethnicities, sexual orientation, things like that?"
14IN,14IN_96,A,"I have no problems with ethnicity and gender, I’m struggling on the sexual orientation because some people don’t even know. My sister was, so she’s at the university, she’s a PHD and she’s applying for a job and they said, “Are you gay?” And she goes,“No.”“Oh it would be easier if you are.” And she’s going, “But I’m not.”“No, because we need that in our, or it would be better.” So, I’m going, “Really.”"
14IN,14IN_97,Q,That was for a position. That’s interesting.
14IN,14IN_98,A,"Yeah, Head of school. So, really,it’s just – so, yes, I mean, people like the diversity but really."
14IN,14IN_99,Q,"It’s just creating a box and now we’re talking about, they wanted to tick a box, so your view then about targets."
15Both,15Both_1,Q,"I’ve just turned my recorder on so, yeah, we’re on. Thanks so much for this interview."
15Both,15Both_10,A,"Absolutely. It was around our capital management policies and around the way in which we return capital to shareholders. There was one board member who felt quite strongly around the fact that we should do a special dividend which required us to take on debt to be able to make that and most of the board I think naturally were pretty averse to taking on debt to pay money to shareholders. But he, through his understanding of financial markets, genuine understanding of the financial strength of our business, managed to convince everyone that that was the right course of action and so that’s what the board took."
15Both,15Both_100,A,"It’s just never struck as being relevant and I don’t even know if it’s legal for us to ask people, “Before you join you have to tell us your religion.” That feels a bit weird. Why does it even bother you? Why would it matter? It’s very difficult to actually try and change something if you don’t measure it."
15Both,15Both_101,A,"Margo, I’m going to have to go. I apologise. There’s someone here who needs this room."
15Both,15Both_102,Q,"I can see. I have spent your [Participant]e. Thank you so much. That was really, really helpful. I wish I could shake your hand."
15Both,15Both_103,A,Have a great day.
15Both,15Both_104,Q,"Same to you. Bye, [Participant]."
15Both,15Both_105,A,Thank you.
15Both,15Both_11,Q,"In hindsight, was that a good decision?"
15Both,15Both_12,A,"In hindsight, I don’t think it had the impact that he expected. It wasn’t a bad decision per se but I don’t think it had the impact that he was hoping for in the share price."
15Both,15Both_13,Q,"The diversity of the board really allowed the board to manage risk in another way I guess, a way that it wouldn’t have done if he wasn’t on the board."
15Both,15Both_14,A,Yes.
15Both,15Both_15,Q,"That’s good. I get that. How does your organisation, this is the Male Champions of Change, how does that seek to influence Australian boards? I’ve got this download from the web."
15Both,15Both_16,A,"Male Champions of Change isn’t predominantly focused on boards. Male Champions of Change is focused on roles within the business so operating leadership roles, representation of women in the workforce, the roles that they play, gender pay equity, et cetera. Therefore, it’s an organisation of CEOs, not of directors. Through that however, what it is seeking to do is to have men who are in leadership positions so male CEOs take accountability for gender equity in their organisation. I think it’s almost impossible to do that in sort of down without thinking about how does that impact upwards as well. I think it’d be hard to be a Male Champion of Change and be on say, 100% male board and not be staring into the fact that what you’re trying to live down here is not reflected up here."
15Both,15Both_17,Q,"This has come up in other interviews. The cultural connection between the board and the organisation the board serves, it needs to be congruent. It just came up. That’s how they described it and I wonder, is this necessary?"
15Both,15Both_18,A,"Absolutely, yes. Because I think the days that an organisation is a walled entity are over. As a CEO you can’t say one thing internally and act one way and then in a different context act in a way that’s inconsistent because that’s just seen as inauthentic. You can’t for example, say one thing to team members and then have a marketing message to customers that is different than that. My team are all active on social media. They comment on what happens at work so it’s a very porous – the concept of a company is now an organisation with very porous edges and the same happens for the board."
15Both,15Both_19,A,"If the board is seen to be living by a different set of standards, a different operating cadence, to different values than the organisation then the organisation sees that. Now it doesn’t see it – it can depend how prominent the chair and the directors choose to be in the business but for example, in our business if our board was all male, with the effort and the accountability that we hold managers to, to getting gender diversity into their teams, they would just look at it and say, “Why me? Why are you telling me to do that when that’s not what happens at the top of the organisation?” You can no longer live sort of in parallel universes or dual existence. There has to be a lot of congruence between those different ways."
15Both,15Both_2,A,"No problem, my pleasure."
15Both,15Both_20,Q,"Something is just coming to me about, as a CEO let’s say there was incongruence, how would you manage that? You’re the link between the two."
15Both,15Both_21,A,"I had a chat to one of our directors about the language that they used because it was out of sync with the language we use at AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY. He’s older. He’s from a different generation and I think his thinking was very good and very high quality but the examples that he used, some of the words that he used to me were frankly, just no longer what you would call contemporary or acceptable in some cases."
15Both,15Both_22,A,"I just had to sit down and let him know that A, that wasn’t what he could do with AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY but B, I don’t think he should have done it anywhere and I liked this person. I considered him a friend and so I sort of thought of myself as really doing him a favour. He said, “It’s funny I was wondering if that sort of persona was wearing a bit thin now and it’s been on my mind a bit” et cetera and I said, “Stop wondering.”"
15Both,15Both_23,Q,It is.
15Both,15Both_24,A,"I think as a CEO, you have to have the courage to do that because that’s obviously a risky situation because the board employs you. My view in general is you can have any conversation with anyone. You just have to think carefully about what the best way to have that conversation is and you have to accept that some messages are very difficult to receive and therefore might not be well received. But I think in the long run you can’t allow things that you think are wrong, harmful for the business, undermining the other work that’s been done to continue."
15Both,15Both_25,Q,"That’s good. That’s really helpful because that was an un-fleshed out area that just arisen. That was the other point, pipeline. What you described, Male Champions of Change are focused on the management level so under the CEO and up to the CEO. I’ve had some interviews. In some interviews it’s come that the pipeline is the problem so women and people from other diverse backgrounds are not getting on boards because they’re not enabled in the pipeline. They’re not getting the management experience that’s necessary or perceived to be necessary for a board position. What do you think about that?"
15Both,15Both_26,A,"I think that’s true and I think that exists across lots of roles and so then it really just comes down to acknowledging that and owning the problem, because the easiest thing to do is to acknowledge it and say, “And therefore it’s too hard,” right?"
15Both,15Both_27,Q,Yes.
15Both,15Both_28,A,"But that doesn’t solve anything. So that’s the big thing as a Male Champion of Change. I think I always would have been someone who people would have said, created environments where both men and women can succeed. I think that people would have said and in fact, all about data says that AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY was a place where people believe, embrace diversity that had a strong sense of belonging for both men and women, people of different religions, different races. We’ve always been I think an environment that allows people to succeed being who they are rather than having to become an [IBMer] 00:14:16 to succeed. We’ve always had that perspective."
15Both,15Both_29,A,"But the difference with the Male Champion of Change is you actually have to own the outcomes. You can’t just say, “I’ve got lots of examples of where women have succeeded in my organisation and therefore, I’ve proven women can succeed in my organisation and surely that’s what my job is, to make sure it’s an environment where both men and women can succeed.” Male champions pushes a step past that and says, “Actually that’s not enough. What you’ve got to do is actually get to the point where there is gender equity.”"
15Both,15Both_3,Q,"[Participant], you’re comfortable with the research. I got your form. You understand I’m taping it. We do transcripts. We de-identify. We’re looking at diversity of boards in the broad sense, not just gender. I see that you’re a member of the Male Champions of Change so I thought I’d focus on how you influence boards, how you seek to influence boards but also your board experience would be great as well if you use both those backgrounds."
15Both,15Both_30,A,"The pipeline for us, the most challenging one is in computer science graduates. Software programming is a very, very male-dominated field. About 17% of computer science graduates in Australia are women and that’s a quarter of our workforce and they’re the highest-paying jobs. If you can’t get 50/50 in that you’re not going to get gender pay equity across our business. It just won’t happen and you’re starting with an 83/17 input. Then of course women who start tend to find that the environment often isn’t an environment they really want to stick in. That they’re in a team of eight people, they’re the only woman. They spend years being the only woman and so they end up changing careers."
15Both,15Both_31,A,"The 17% gets worse as you get to senior and they’re looking for software engineers with 20 years’ experience to become a senior architect or whatever it might be. There is a real pipeline problem. But what Male Champions of Change says that’s no excuse. That’s just no excuse so you’ve got to think about how do you change the pipeline. We’re now getting to the point where we’re getting 40% intake of our software engineers are women. Now it’s going to be a long [Participant]e to build the skills to get to the point where we can get that at senior levels in the software engineering team. But it’s a bit like the Peter Drucker quote, “The best day to plant a tree was 20 years ago but the second best day is today” because if you don’t start then you won’t have a tree in 20 years’ [Participant]e either."
15Both,15Both_32,Q,I’m intrigued so 40%. Is this affirmative action? Are you employing women who are less skilled than men in the early stages? How is it then? Was it 17% at the university are graduates are women and then you’re selecting 40% women? Did I get that right?
15Both,15Both_33,A,"You did. No, it’s not. All of the women that we bring in have that position through their credentials. I think there’s two things. One, we’ve proven that we have a genuine commitment to gender equity so although 17% of women we become a very attractive employer, they understand that they’re not going to be the only women who’s starting with us that year et cetera, so it just becomes a natural gravity to where we’re able to draw more of that pool."
15Both,15Both_34,A,"But secondly, we thought more broadly about, how can we bring more women into the software engineering profession? So we run a specific program called Developer where we employ women on an internship. It’s about a nine-month program and by the end of that we get their skill capability up to the same as a three-year undergraduate computer science degree holder. These are women who have other roles in our business. They’re women who maybe have had children and are returning to the workforce and don’t want to go back to their former career or they’re just women who want to a change in career. So we made a firm commitment that we will be 50/50 at the graduate level and so if we can’t recruit enough on campus we supplement that with the Developer program to make sure we’re 50/50 at the graduate level. Now then as you go more through the organisation, it’s more challenging. I won’t say can’t but it’s very difficult to get 50/50 in the senior roles which is why the overall average is down to the 40%."
15Both,15Both_35,Q,"Will these people, the women who do your in-house course will they have equal opportunity to those who have graduated from uni in other organisations? Is it respect –"
15Both,15Both_36,A,The first cohort that we put into this is now about three years ago and there were three women. One didn’t work out and the other two both left the organisation and taken on successful software development roles somewhere else.
15Both,15Both_37,Q,"That’s great. That’s really good. Are you also working with the university sector, perhaps scholarships for women or something like that so that the can get through them?"
15Both,15Both_38,A,No. We’re really trying to focus on the Developer program and putting our effort there because that is far faster for us to get results.
15Both,15Both_39,Q,That makes sense. Would other people in the Male Champions of Change be doing similar things to manage the pipeline?
15Both,15Both_4,Q,"We might as well get right into it. There’s a lot of talk about board diversity but we’re interested to hear in this research from people who are working in the field on boards or influencing boards. As I said, I’m seeing you as someone who influences boards, as well as, someone who’s on a board so we’ll have both perspectives. Anyway, first how have the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed over [Participant]e in terms of diversity? Has it increased, decreased, not changed?"
15Both,15Both_40,A,"I think they’re all doing different things and I think it does come down to each organisation. I know REA have openly said in public forums, “We saw what AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY was doing. We thought it was great and copied it” which is fantastic. We tell the story as widely as we can just to try and s[Participant]ulate other people learning from what we do."
15Both,15Both_41,Q,"That’s brilliant. I really like that. Thank you, that’s great. Let’s think about why it might be important. How important do you think diverse boards are? Say 10 is extremely important and 1 is not important at all, where would you put it?"
15Both,15Both_42,A,It’s high. It’s probably an 8 or a 9.
15Both,15Both_43,Q,"Do you feel that it’s always been this important and if this has always been the case or not always been the case, what do you feel has changed the importance rating that you would give it?"
15Both,15Both_44,A,"I think it’s always been important. Perhaps not quite as important as it is now but I think it’s always been important just probably less appreciated. Let me say why I think it’s important and then come back to why it’s becoming more important. I think there are three things. Number one, just from a corporate risk perspective, I think that consumers increasingly care about the business that they engage with and that they increasingly want to see businesses that represent the community that they’re a part of. For me just from a, will we be able to get employees in the future, the best employees? Will customers want to engage with AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY? How will our supply chain look at us?"
15Both,15Both_45,A,"I think that if you didn’t have a diverse board that would be one of the signals that people would look at and say, “I really don’t want to go and work there.” I think just from a, setting yourself up for success in the future and I’ll call it corporate risk because I think there’s just a risk that you’ll be left out of opportunities if you don’t do that."
15Both,15Both_46,A,"Number two, I think that diverse teams make better decisions and that gets back to the point that we were talking about 10 or 15 minutes ago in the example that I gave of once you’ve got diversity of viewpoints through diversity of experience you’re more likely to make a well-balanced, well-rounded decision as a team. Then number three, for me it just comes back to the individuals. If you believe that talent enters the workplace roughly 50/50 distributed across men and women that are entering the workplace and every piece of evidence says if it’s not exactly 50/50, it’s within 49/51 depending on what tests you look at and whatever but you just take it there."
15Both,15Both_47,A,"If you look at a system where today, I think it’s 6% of ASX200 businesses have female CEOs then you’ve got stand back and say, the system is doing something to materially skew the opportunities that happen to those two groups of people who enter with sort of talent distributed evenly across them. So for me, I stand back and say, “As a CEO I own that system. I have the power. I have the authority to change the way things are done. So how do I feel about standing in front of a group of graduates who started AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY and simply by, not even looking at them, just by knowing their gender on a list, saying that one has 20 [Participant]es the likelihood of taking my role at some point in the future than another?”"
15Both,15Both_48,A,"I don’t have to have a single conversation. I don’t have to look at them. I don’t have to have any EQ reading. There’s nothing. If I know their gender, I can just know that the evidence says that that’s the reality of the system as it’s operated over the last couple of decades for me to get to this position. The truth is I feel awful about that. That’s a terrible system and to own a system that biases so heavily more one group and against another group isn’t representative of the country that I believed I was born into. It isn’t representative of what I believe was a meritocracy. I grew up in a middle-income family at a country high school. I didn’t have the private school connections or anything else but I believed if I worked hard I could do whatever and I’ve been able to."
15Both,15Both_49,A,"Now it was years and years later, in fact in the last few years that I realised that I’m a white man and actually the system wasn’t ever a meritocracy. It may have been a meritocracy amongst white men but there was significant skews and biases all working in my favour compared to say, my sister who left high school with similar talents and capabilities to me. For me it comes to those three levels as to why do we need to do this from a corporate risk perspective, from making better decisions and frankly, from just doing what I think is the right thing."
15Both,15Both_5,A,"Again, having been on the AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY board for 12 years, that’s the main reference point that I have, there is no doubt that diversity is a much higher topic I think the in the conversations of all boards. If I think about the AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY board, there is no doubt that it had become significantly more diverse over the last decade. That diversity has come both through diversity of experience, being the primary one but also from gender and race, if I reflect on it."
15Both,15Both_50,A,"Why has it become more important of recent [Participant]e? To answer your question, I think on the first of those the community expectations have changed and I think 15 years ago people may have been happy to buy products from a company that didn’t represent the community. In fact that just wasn’t seen as important. I think it’s lifted in the communities’ views and therefore companies need to respond to that. On the middle one of making better decisions, I don’t think that that was appreciated and understood as much in the past as it is today. Now I will say the importance hasn’t changed there but the understanding of the importance has changed. On the third one, again just simply doing the right thing. I think that the conversation wasn’t there and so it was just a lens but lots of people who were in positions of authority never looked through."
15Both,15Both_51,A,"I think things like Male Champions of Change, I think that’s the real power that Liz Broderick has had, is to challenge people like me to look through that lens and to then trust that frankly, when we do look through it, we’re likely to see things in a different light because she’s an incredibly persuasive person who never tells you what to do. She has a real power of helping you see things for what they are but not blaming and therefore, not making a negative engagement. It’s not just her obviously. There’s tons of people who have been involved in that shift to help people like me see the reality of the systems that have been built over [Participant]e and that we oversee. I’m prattling on so tell me Margo, if you want me to stop."
15Both,15Both_52,A,"What amazes our team and I’ve had these conversations about what it means to be a Male Champion of Change, about six months ago I did town halls in all of our offices talking about sexual harassment and everyday sexism and raising this. One of our team members in Brisbane, a woman, told a story to the team there which I then repeated around all the other offices. When she worked at the AMP when she was married, just before she left for the wedding, she got called into her manager’s office. She went in and she was handed her letter of resignation."
15Both,15Both_53,Q,When was this?
15Both,15Both_54,A,"Because married women weren’t allowed to work at AMP. She’s still a team member today. She’s a great grandmother today but she’s still a team member here. She works three days a week and people couldn’t believe that. That it was that recent. If you think about that system, that wasn’t viewed as being bad. That was actually viewed by society as being quite reasonable and probably the right thing to do. If you think about the thousands of years that we as a species have that are being baked into these systems and in this case the system of business where in such a recent [Participant]e that was considered normal and good by lots of people, then there’s a lot of change that has happened."
15Both,15Both_55,A,"But you also got to recognise that we didn’t reset. What we’ve been doing is morphing and adapting and trying to change from that starting point which is a really dramatic starting point to trying to get the whole way to say, we don’t believe there are gender biases in our system of work anymore."
15Both,15Both_56,Q,Wow. So you want to reset? No adapt?
15Both,15Both_57,A,"No. I can’t reset because I can’t change everyone’s experiences. I can’t overnight just say, “That system is done. Here’s a new system.” It’s not a computer program where I can say, “The old one is now dead. We built a new computer program” because these are people. You’re trying to change people and so people turn up to work today expecting that work will be done the way it was done yesterday. So to bring people on a journey of change, to bring systems on a journey of change, et cetera, we’re trying to put effort and energy into compressing the [Participant]e as much as possible but when you’re dealing with humans a reset is just impossible."
15Both,15Both_58,Q,"Your employing strategy is supporting people to see themselves differently and see their team differently, your employment strategies here at AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY. That’s potentially quite a quick change in a social organisation, isn’t it?"
15Both,15Both_59,A,"I mean in three years we’ve moved from being a 38% women to 44% women so that’s a material change in three years and our goal is to be greater than 40% men and greater than 40% women in all our communities. So hierarchically, vertically, wherever you’re looking to teams, you will find that any team has quite naturally got a good gender balance and it’s not 50/50 because I think by the [Participant]e you’re 50/50 you aren’t prescribing quotas and that gets back to the, are you lowering standards and so on?"
15Both,15Both_6,Q,Why do you think that’s happened?
15Both,15Both_60,A,"Some[Participant]es there is just an abundance of talent for whatever reason at one point in [Participant]e from women or men who apply and we’re a commercial entity. But I think if you get to at least 40% no one really feels like they’re in the minority. People don’t feel like they’re the only one, like they’ve got to constantly represent one viewpoint but I always find that naturally they’re in a team where there’s multiple viewpoints."
15Both,15Both_61,Q,I was also wondering if you were accommodating – because with students some people don’t identify with either male or female and we tend to divide gender as male or female.
15Both,15Both_62,A,"If you look on our website at our employment page, one of our transgender team members is one of the team members that we highlight on that page."
15Both,15Both_63,Q,"So you accommodate also different identities. That’s great. That’s good, without labelling, great. I wonder if I’ll just ask a couple of questions but I really want to turn it over to you because I love the way you’re talking about the system and I’d like you to talk about how we might – you’ve described the elements of the system like measure elements, norms, understandings, and you’ve described in the org, you’re using AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY as an example of organisations, businesses. You might want to talk a little more about your understanding of the system, how it’s currently, let’s say holding patterns that are not ideal and then what can be done? You’ve given us an example of what you’re doing at AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY but what can be done more broadly here in Australia do you think? Then we’ll use the last to patch up questions that might not be answered."
15Both,15Both_64,A,"Sure. I think the first thing to realise is the system inside AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY doesn’t exist in isolation. We’re obviously part of a broader community as well. One of the things for example we’re trying to do is look at where does talent leave the system and particularly where does it leave the system biased to gender? One of the areas is parental responsibilities. We will see that when team members have a family that disproportionately, it is a female team member who takes parental leave as the primary caregiver and then disproportionately therefore, that’s a moment in [Participant]e that can cause people to leave the system."
15Both,15Both_65,A,"So we’ve been very focused on two things. One, talking to the men in our organisation about what that actually means, to becoming a father and the support that that means you might need to think about and how we can support you in supporting your family. Secondly, through the period that women do choose to take parental leave really keeping connections with them. One of the things at the end of that period is that there’s a feeling like, I’m not sure if I still have the skills. I’m not sure if I still have the social connections. There’s a barrier to overcome, to choosing at that moment to re-enter an organisation. Whereas if you’re invited to team events along the way, if you are continuing to keep in touch with what’s happening in the organisation then that feels like a less – that barrier is lower for you to say, “Actually, I’d like to come back.”"
15Both,15Both_66,A,"Secondly, we’re doing a lot around flexibility. I’d like to come back but would it be possible for me to come back three days a week or four days a week? Can I change my hours of work so that I start earlier and leave earlier because my partner can drop the kids at school but I really want to be there to pick them up? How can I increase flexibility? We have a policy that all roles flex and the manager has to say why it’s not possible to do a job through a requested flexibility or flexible conditions rather than the employee having to build a case as to why that should be okay so trying to change the dial on all of those things."
15Both,15Both_67,A,"But the one for example that I talked about, we would love to see parental leave be taken equally by men and women but that’s just societal change. So getting to your question, what can be done more broadly in Australia, that’s a conversation we can have with men at AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY but that’s 1% of the conversation that they’re going to have. It’s going to be a conversation they have with their friends, with their dad, with their brothers, with their partner. All of those conversations are going to have more influence than the conversation that we have at work."
15Both,15Both_68,A,"But what we do try and do is promote and highlight the cases where we see things happening that we think if more people knew that, they would feel like they had permission to do that. We try and put in place specific policies where we can see systematic points of linkage. We try and highlight conversations around what Liz Broderick describes as the gender asbestos. It’s invisible. You can’t see it. You can’t smell it but it’s in the air. It’s in the walls. It’s in the ceiling and it’s deadly and that sort of comes down to the everyday sexism type things. We absolutely had open conversations about sexual harassment but there are laws around that and there are procedures and it doesn’t always get reported. But what we’ve tried to is make it okay to have the conversations and make it okay to have, that’s a not okay conversation without it being a legal proceeding because lots of people don’t want to pursue it to that extent."
15Both,15Both_69,A,"But also just try to make sure that men and women are equally aware of the signs of everyday sexism and the impact that that has on people over a long period of [Participant]e. This is the roles that people are expected to play, the language that is used. When talking about this, I had a female developer who highlighted the fact that software developers have code reviews so if you’ve written some code I might review it. I’ve written some code. You might review it before we can commit to actually going into the formal testing and production systems. She’s just said, “It’s all the [Participant]e that I get told to have one of the guys check my code. It continually reinforces the fact that in this company, as a woman, my code isn’t seen as being the same quality as a guy’s because I have to have a man check my code first.”"
15Both,15Both_7,A,"I think there’s a growing appreciation of the fact that boards are a team endeavour and that the team is stronger, often more difficult to manage but stronger if they bring different experiences to the table. Therefore, if you’ve got a board member who is continually thinking about how the public markets will respond to something and you’ve got another board member whose natural bias is towards thinking about what will be the impact on the team and how will the team respond if this is the decision, and you’ve got another board member who is thinking very much as to are we going to be able to successfully sell that and how will our clients react?"
15Both,15Both_70,A,"Now the reality is I think the term ‘guys’ was not perceived by the people who use it to be a gender exclusive term. The fact is the two senior developers in the crew that she’s a part of are both men and so it was being suggested that one of those two men should review it, the same as they do the junior men in that group. But the fact that she had never had her code reviewed by another woman, only ever by men, had an absolute impact on her seeing ceilings where the organisation wasn’t trying to put them. So to all of those everyday things that we need to tackle, from the community perspective I think we just need more leaders that have conversations the way we’re trying to have leaders inside the organisation having those conversations because the more education we can have the more awareness that we can have"
15Both,15Both_71,A,It’s why I talk on – I’m doing panels and conferences and so on about this because I think it’s a conversation that men have felt excluded from. I’ve actually been warned by women before. “Listen this might be a hostile environment for you to go and have this conversation because there are women who really feel like they own the women agenda and by you being a man and participating in that they actually don’t want you. They’re happier with the way it was. This is the feminist movement” and so on.
15Both,15Both_72,A,"Everyone’s welcome to their perspective but I think electively we’ll be more successful in tackling the problem if A, we all are focused on tackling the problem and B, if people who are in positions of authority and power are tackling the problem. The message is if people in positions of authority and power are not welcome in the conversation then that’s a very easy copout for people, very easy. I think right around having more community leaders who are diverse, talking about diversity. So if men are talking about gender diversity, different people are talking about diversity but it’s not if you like, those that are seen as being excluded or in the minority who have to [unclear] 00:43:06."
15Both,15Both_73,Q,"That’s right. It would be nice if we had more politicians speaking positively about diversity instead of – we’re back in, to me I feel a sense of the 60s, 70s in what I’m seeing on the media about the current political status and they’re important leaders. That’s really interesting. That is so good because it’s very different. Your pitch is very different to other interviews I’ve had. That’s why I wanted to give you a free wheel because that social, political way you see things is really useful. Now, back to the board, you described mechanisms for AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY as an organisation. Now with the board, what kinds of mechanisms might help to shape that leadership level for the same effect?"
15Both,15Both_74,A,To get gender equity?
15Both,15Both_75,Q,"Correct, to do what you’re trying to do here."
15Both,15Both_76,A,"So one of the things that we did was as a board agree to diversity targets which we have to. We have to report them in our annual report but there’s nothing that says that they have to be about board representation or there’s no prescribed set of metrics. You just have to have a set of targets and track against those targets. That was a really useful mechanism for us to say, “All right, should board gender mix be an item” and I said to the board, “I think it should, how are we going to get there?” There’s a big push at the moment to be 30% of directors being female."
15Both,15Both_77,A,"When we started out at that point we’re a six-member board with one female so we became a seven-member board with two females which meant we were sitting at 29% or something. Now we determined we did not want to be an eight-person board and we didn’t have an underperforming director that we wanted to move on. What we said was, “Listen, in the next 12 months we’re comfortable with where we are but we put long-term objectives out there where we said like the rest of AN AUSTRALIAN IT COMPANY a long term objective is to be 40%.” Had we had the one male standing down and the female then we would have got there. So we could see a very direct line of sight. Justin, our chair, and I focused in our pipelines on continuing to meet female directors, people who we thought had good backgrounds when that moment came and this is one of the things you learn. If you leave it until the last minute you will find that there are multiple qualified men for every one qualified woman and that gets back to the pipeline issue. How do you get around that? You don’t leave it until the last minute. You plan and prepare and you spend [Participant]e."
15Both,15Both_78,A,"Of course the very good women are highly sought after and so they’re actually far more difficult to recruit. So you’ve got to make sure therefore that you’re on their list well in advance of needing them and they’re on your list because at that point in [Participant]e when the opportunity comes up they say, “I’ve been tracking you for a couple of years and I really like some of the things you’re doing. I do have this board over here which I’m not enjoying and actually, I wouldn’t mind stepping down somewhere in the next 12 months.” So that will happen but if you leave it until the last minute when you’ve got six weeks and you want to make an appointment and they don’t know who you are, then the high-quality candidates won’t be interested in joining. You just won’t get that done at that point in [Participant]e. But you may well get a qualified man because the demand and supply equations are different."
15Both,15Both_79,Q,"How do you find these people, your recruits?"
15Both,15Both_8,A,"The experience that the board members have naturally leads them to have a bias in viewpoints and we all do. There’s no one who doesn’t bring biases because of what we call experience, right? Experience builds preconceived ideas and et cetera. Then as a team, they’re more likely to have a richer conversation. I’ve seen circumstances where one board member has moved the entire board and had that board member not been there and brought that one lens that they were very, very strong on, then the board would have taken a different position. I think that’s now sort of widely appreciated."
15Both,15Both_80,A,It’s just constant working.
15Both,15Both_81,Q,"Is it networking, digital?"
15Both,15Both_82,A,"Constant networking from the existing board members, from talking to other CEOs who are listing their company and looking at setting up boards, from being a part of the Business Council of Australia through Male Champions of Change, all of those things. It’s a relatively small business community in Sydney and you’re constantly –"
15Both,15Both_83,Q,"Bumping into each other. Given it’s an informal network, are there structures that shape that like men’s club or cultural differences like football? No?"
15Both,15Both_84,A,No. I think there were. I think that’s likely.
15Both,15Both_85,Q,Brilliant.
15Both,15Both_86,A,"There are business groups. There’s the BCA. There’s the CEW, the women’s CEO group, Male Champions of Change. There’s the Institute of Company Directors. There’s a few business orientations but they happen very much for business now. They don’t happen at a football club membership. I don’t know if there – are there still men’s clubs?"
15Both,15Both_87,Q,There’s one in Melbourne still.
15Both,15Both_88,A,I wouldn’t have a clue whether there’s one in Sydney or not. It wouldn’t be appealing to me and therefore I’d never go looking for it so I’ll probably never be invited.
15Both,15Both_89,Q,"Not that you worry. [Participant], what struck me, it’s so good that we’re tapping into the current situation because the literature, it is or by definition 10 years plus out of date. I’m aware of how rapidly changing our world is, socially, culturally as well as business. Can you think now about how in 10 years’ [Participant]e in the future, how would you like to see diversity in Australian boards? Please feel free to broaden your consideration of diversity, from gender to other things, different ethnicities and ages and things like that."
15Both,15Both_9,Q,"That sounds like a really interesting example. Can you tell me about that? How that came about, that one tangential perspective that influenced the decision by the board?"
15Both,15Both_90,A,"I think the diversity of boards will likely lag the diversity of, I’ll call them business roles and there’s a broad interpretation of that but if you don’t understand business – I sit on a public company board. There might be circumstances where you’ll have one director who has a political background because there’s a government relations component and so it’s not exclusively – business is the wrong word. Are there commercially-relevant experiences? It might be a broader set of terms."
15Both,15Both_91,A,"But if you don’t get 50% of women in parliament then you won’t have 50% of politicians retiring who are women which means when those roles open up the pipeline will be heavily skewed towards men and so on. I think boards in some senses because of the requirement for experience will lag other areas and I think we’ve got to accept that. I think given the number of board seats there’s plenty of talent available. I think that it has to be a priority of agenda while the pipeline is not 50/50 but I think there is sufficient pipeline to at least get to the 40/40 where you say at any point in [Participant]e at least 40% of directors are women, at least 40% are men and we accept if we want someone with specifics then there’s going to be 20% which is just based on the talent pool available. Frankly, when you’re looking at six or seven people it literally comes to one individual that can then move sort of from the 40%."
15Both,15Both_92,A,"The thing that I think is going to be more challenging and the thing that I think is the step further on is then within the talent diversity, so the experience diversity I said we had the person who really understood financial engineering inside our balance sheet and P&L was one of our directives. We had somebody else who was a lawyer and really looked at the governance side. I think that you find and we find this in our company today that there are gender skews in both areas of the business that are predominantly women and areas that are predominantly men. What’s actually difficult is to balance, to say we want both of those areas to be gender-diverse."
15Both,15Both_93,A,"I think what you’ll find is there’ll be women who run [unclear] 00:53:13 far more prominently or added to the board for commercial experience and so on and that’s okay because it’s a first step. But what you [unclear] 00:53:25 is to have, if you’ve got two or three people with commercial experience, a couple with legal experience and maybe one with government, you’d really rather not have three men with commercial experience, two women who are lawyers because you’d get a stronger conversation if you actually had diversity within those functional expertise, which is another layer beyond just having the optics of gender diversity on the board overall."
15Both,15Both_94,Q,"You see a difference, quite important. Can you flesh this out a little between men and women in terms of what they might bring to a function, a skill they have? Can you talk about that a little?"
15Both,15Both_95,A,"I think that brings different experiences as people. I think what you see is let’s just say that we had two people who had run those organisations all their career and maybe they were CEO or maybe they left as a senior executive in a sales [unclear] 00:54:37 function. I think the man and the woman there would see things through different lenses. They would have faced quite possibly some of the things we were talking about earlier of moments of dislocation differently through their career. They would have, in all likelihood, had to be in a minority or being part of a majority as they build their career to different extents and in different circumstances and so on."
15Both,15Both_96,A,"I think for another least 10 and probably 20 years, if you have those two people, while they had similar functional experience they would have had different life experiences, just because one was a man and one was a woman in the workplace over the last 30 years. I think that’s an important difference. I hope in the future it won’t be. I hope in the future parenting responsibilities would more likely been equally born by those two people and so on. I’d love to get to a point where I could say honestly, we can just drop that and move past it but I don’t think we’re there realistically today. If you don’t acknowledge it then what you do is have two people who don’t bring to this perspective of what it’s like to build a career and be a senior sales leader as a man versus as a woman."
15Both,15Both_97,Q,I can see why it’s so important that you hang a lot of gender diversity. I can see that. It makes sense. You’ve spoken in the beginning about how experience shapes decision making in teams and that improves decision making and manages corporate risk because of perceptions. I get that. I can see this is a really nice coherent story for me.
15Both,15Both_98,A,"Margo, just to fill one thing actually. The good thing for me is actually the diversity of thought and diversity of experience. We then have gender. Partly the reason that I don’t talk about race and other forms of diversity nearly as much is in our organisation we are actually quite diverse and so across our organisation you’ll see that there are people of different religions, people of different races, et cetera, right through the organisation. We don’t measure it so we don’t ask people to identify a religion. I can’t actually tell you what the diversity is and it’s very difficult to manage something that you don’t measure. We don’t ask people their ethnic background."
15Both,15Both_99,Q,Is that by choice? Obviously by choice but why don’t you?
16IN,16IN_1,Q,"Good, Okay [Participant], thank you for agreeing to be interviewed -"
16IN,16IN_10,A,Education.
16IN,16IN_100,A,"It's hard because I think there's - if you're moving outside of gender, I'd say you'd still find men that think differently as well, have a real issue. People that are from different cultural backgrounds. I'd say women that get to the C-suite are similar - it's really at the moment, still similar people getting to that stage where they're outcomes focussed. They're really driven to make decisions so they're usually the people that are getting to those positions, more so than the process driven people, or the people-people. A lot of it is personality and interpersonal skills rather than all technical competencies. And we see that time and time again. People succeeding because of their interpersonal skills, which is great, but big personalities aren't always the best CEOs! I think we've got a long way to go in terms of really understanding where the people's different thinking styles and how to use that effectively, and how to develop people that may not have those interpersonal styles, but would make great leaders. How do you develop that into - it's like how do you get an introvert to be at times extroverted? It's a bit difficult! That's a real challenge, I think."
16IN,16IN_101,Q,"Okay, yeah. With selection, board selection, director selection, there's the skills matrix that people tend to use and whatever and they map it to their - this is what the board needs, given its purpose and blah, blah and so this is what we need, these are the skills; but this is a different way. It's like well yes, we need an accountant, someone with financial skills, but from this lens of cognitive diversity we need someone who's got strong people skills or is an empathetic person -"
16IN,16IN_102,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_103,Q,"- or they think in terms of process and depth of understanding, rather than outcomes focussed and short-term financial and whatever. I don't know how you cast it at the board level, but is that the sort of thing - how would you be able to select for this?And how does it compete with the other tool that's pretty standard -"
16IN,16IN_104,A,"Well, I suppose -"
16IN,16IN_105,Q,-@ tools matrix?
16IN,16IN_106,A,"- a lot of boards wouldn't do an assessment via someone's cognitive diversity as such, but in saying that, it depends on - a lot of recruits now, like the big four, have very useful leadership competencies and styles assessments tools. They will have a candidate complete that and so they will be able to talk to a board about an individual's leadership style and their competencies, and assess them more than just their technical skills. I'd say listed boards now, are very focussed on not just having someone technically competent. When they interview a director, they will want to know what their leadership style was, they will want to have an understanding of where that person will sit in different issues, how they will navigate a crisis situation. Whether they'll stay calm or get panicked, that sort of thing. They'll want to see they interact with other members of the board and their executive team, so other members of the board will interview a new candidate, usually the whole board meets them, members of the executive team will meet them."
16IN,16IN_107,A,"We released a 30% Club report on Wednesday on the next - actually I've got a copy here if you like - this was from the 'Pathways to ASX 200 Boards'from the 2018 appointees, so not - just last year for men and women. What was really, I suppose heartening, was that the journey in terms of the recruitment process in getting on to the boards was really similar for males and females. But what they were saying is that directors are - boards are looking for more than just people that are technically qualified. They're looking for people that have moral integrity, that do have compassion, ability to learn and develop as people. So, I'd say chairs are becoming better at trying to understand that.Because they know that they've got a small group of people and so yes, they want someone to challenge, but they need to also have people that work well in a team environment; because the board dynamics are really important."
16IN,16IN_108,A,"They can't afford to have a director that's just disruptive for the sake of being disruptive, that causes conflict. So, there's a difference between challenging effectively and having a different point of view to someone that's just causing conflict. It's a hard skill to learn as a director, like when to ask to questions? what are the right questions? when to stay silent? Because they're all skills too, that you don't really learn until you're on the board or on a board. That's tough and so a good chair would also be a mentor. Mentor a new director as to how the board operates, that sort of - some of those mechanics, talking to them off side about questions, that sort of thing."
16IN,16IN_109,Q,"So, do most chairs - are they like a mentor for the directors?"
16IN,16IN_11,Q,Education?
16IN,16IN_110,A,"Not for established directors because - more for newer directors to the board. So, if they're a newish director they should be doing a mentor role. If they're new to the board, they'll just try and help them, induct them into the board and help them get up to scratch with the way that the board operates. But really, a good chair should also be questioning, ensuring that the directors are engaging in some sort of professional development, learning, engaging with the outside world. Because it's a hard role being the chair. It's a tough role. You can't say one way works better, because they're all so different."
16IN,16IN_111,Q,"Yeah, it depends on the board!"
16IN,16IN_112,A,"It depends on the chair, as well -"
16IN,16IN_113,Q,On the chair!
16IN,16IN_114,A,On the style and the way they like to run things.
16IN,16IN_115,Q,"Does it depend on the industry, do you think?"
16IN,16IN_116,A,"A bit, but I don't know. From the chairs I've talked to, I think it more depends on personal style and their executive experience and how they've run things in the past. Some will more sit back and want the directors to talk and then give their point of view at the end. Others will kind of challenge whilst they're going, it's really preference. Some are more of the quiet ones; some are more bombastic. So, I see it as more of a personal style approach."
16IN,16IN_117,Q,"So, they're really cultivating a team? It's like a team, the directors?"
16IN,16IN_118,A,"Oh, yeah. That's why not all ex CEOs will make good directors because they're used to commanding and control, some of them, and you've got to work as a team as a board. You've got to support your fellow directors and you've got to build up trust and mutual respect. That's really important."
16IN,16IN_119,Q,"How might they do that for someone say who's quite visibly different? It might be someone who's black skinned in a predominantly white board? Or in the old days it was gender, but hopefully we've got at least - if it's 30% we should have at least three, is that right?"
16IN,16IN_12,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_120,A,"Yes. It's hard, because I think of course the board and the chair can make people feel included. It's reallyimportant that they make new directors feel welcome and that they can have a pointof view, and they encourage them to speak andto have a point of view. And, they ensure that they feel included in the culture. But it is really tough though if you're the one different director in a group of maybe seven. Because I suppose it's like all environments, you do develop ways of doing things, don't you? If the board has a certain way of doing things and certain discussions, and you feel that you're not in this inner circle because they've been all directors onthe board for years, it is really tough! And it's intimidating and you've got to be a strong person and incredibly resilient to go into a boardroom and not care that you're the one person. So, yeah that's a bit of a responsibility for that one person as well. So, we say it's not ideal, because you also don't want to look to that person to be the view of their gender or their race or the culture -"
16IN,16IN_121,Q,Or their age group.
16IN,16IN_122,A,"- or their age, exactly! It's not fair on them and of course they don't represent everyone in their whatever demographic. I think that's very tough but then you'll talk to some women as the only woman on the board and they’re fine, and that's because the board has a really good culture. But I say most would prefer that there would be more than them, you talk to them and they're like, well would like a few more!"
16IN,16IN_123,Q,Because otherwise it could be a bit token.
16IN,16IN_124,A,"Well it's hard for them. It's hard to feel that you can sometimes have your point of view and say stuff, so yeah."
16IN,16IN_125,Q,Without any backing! That's great. Okay so how does your organisation seek to influence boards?
16IN,16IN_126,A,"Well it depends on which elements you're looking at. We do a lot of education because we're - of course we're strong supporters of good governance, so we try to educate as much as possible through courses, through events, through our magazine and different resources. We also try to do - like we've got a Governance Leadership Centre so we try to promote new thinking or different thinking, so that people can engage and go 'oh well maybe I haven't thought of that way'. We try to look more than - to talk more like the Royal Commission that when we did the roadshows, that culture is really important and how do you influence that as a director? So, we also try to look at some of the forward agenda stuff, like what's coming up for directors? Being a director is more than the technical skills. How do we help directors and provide resources that support them?"
16IN,16IN_127,A,"But in my role, a lot of it is advocacy, it's campaigning so it's developing resources to change people's point of view or to help them with something. It's the getting chairs to support diversity through becoming a chair member of the 30% Club, it's talking to them, getting them involved in different diversity initiatives. It's me trying to influence the way that they're thinking, or just to understand what's going on, I think it's really important to understand. I'm quite happy to hear divergent view points and negative view points if it helps us in developing the right resources. So, we try to be very welcoming and inclusive and we are a member-based organisation, so our members are very diverse as well. But yeah, it's really about advocacy and the campaigning and putting messages out in the media, because at the end of the day I can't recruit a board member. I have no influence on who gets appointed! We can only do what we can do, and hope that chairs go 'well yeah actually I do need someone with a diverse point of view on board'. And we work with recruiters too, to ensure that they believe in it. Although a lot do and the search process is becoming more rigorous."
16IN,16IN_128,A,"There're some amazing search consultants out there really looking further afield. Looking outside of the current director network, looking overseas, trying to find different individuals. So, I 'd say a lot of search consultants are doing a really good job, some aren't but that’s like anything isn't it?"
16IN,16IN_129,Q,"Should I - I mean I've talked to one, I'm just wondering if I should talk to another search consultant? And if so, who would you recommend?"
16IN,16IN_13,Q,"You mentioned, so it's chairs because I looked on your website so you've got a specific Chair's -"
16IN,16IN_130,A,"Well that depends, you've got the big ones, like the SHREKs but then you've got some really good boutique consultancies as well, which do an excellent job."
16IN,16IN_131,Q,"In terms of diversity, who would you recommend?"
16IN,16IN_132,A,"Oh, it depends, I'd still talk to some of the big ones. I think, Heidi Mason, who's now at Korn Ferry, she was at Egon Zehnder. She's got a wealth of experience in this space. But the Chair of our Executive Search Group, Jane Neale from Hattonneale, she's really excellent."
16IN,16IN_133,Q,"Okay, well that's two."
16IN,16IN_134,A,"In the - Nick Fletcher from Russell Reynolds here, because he's Melbourne based."
16IN,16IN_135,Q,"Yeah, that's easier for me because I find Zoom is terrible."
16IN,16IN_136,A,"It's hard, yeah."
16IN,16IN_137,Q,"Nick Fletcher, from?"
16IN,16IN_138,A,"Fletcher, Russell Reynolds yeah, he's here."
16IN,16IN_139,Q,That's a good start -
16IN,16IN_14,A,"Mentoring Programme, yep."
16IN,16IN_140,A,"They'll tell you about some of the practical realities as well with this, as well, that it can be hard."
16IN,16IN_141,Q,[Unclear]00:38:30 I probably need at little more on that -
16IN,16IN_142,A,And it depends what the sector you're looking at too.
16IN,16IN_143,Q,"- particularly in terms of leadership. I loved what you said about leadership, how the -"
16IN,16IN_144,A,"Oh, they all have their tools and measurement that they're very protective of!"
16IN,16IN_145,Q,[Unclear] 00:38:47
16IN,16IN_146,A,Their IP!
16IN,16IN_147,Q,"Yeah, exactly! They might tell me enough that we can -"
16IN,16IN_148,A,"They'll show them to me but they won't - that's it! That's fine, I like - it's great to see that they're doing that sort of stuff."
16IN,16IN_149,Q,I think competition is good.
16IN,16IN_15,Q,-@ mentoring Programme as Well as -@ when did you introduce that?
16IN,16IN_150,A,"We're using Heidrick & Struggles for our assessment of our Chairs Mentoring Programme applicants. This is the first time we've used a consultant and they're doing the leadership matrix and interviewing them. Which is excellent because it removes me from the process! Which I think is very important and yeah, I'm fascinated to see their assessments of individuals. I think it's great."
16IN,16IN_151,Q,Excellent. How important - I'm moving all around the place - how important do you think it is to have a diverse board?
16IN,16IN_152,A,Like huge!
16IN,16IN_153,Q,"One is nothing, not at all, 10 is extremely, so one to 10?"
16IN,16IN_154,A,Well I'd say 10. It's extremely important.
16IN,16IN_155,Q,Good.
16IN,16IN_156,A,As long as you harness it in the right way! That would be the caveat.
16IN,16IN_157,Q,"As long as it's well harnessed. Yeah, I like that! Do you think it's always been important?"
16IN,16IN_158,A,"I think it's more the people didn't really think about it. They felt if they had people from different - that had done really well in their executive careers - that they would be able to cover everything. And that's fair enough. It's like everything, we're learning and developing. So, yeah, I just don't think people thought about it, really."
16IN,16IN_159,Q,"Exactly. What do you think has caused that change in thinking, that people now think about it?"
16IN,16IN_16,A,"The Chair's Mentoring Programme, our first one launched in 2010 so we really started - AICD started focussing on this in about 2009 and that's when the percentage of women on ASX 200 Boards was 8.3%, so really low. Internally there was a bit of conversation - I wasn't in the diversity role then and internally there was a conversation, what we can do? So, with the Mentoring Programme we matched ASX 200 chairs with - I wouldn't say even emerging female directors - they were really amazing executives that you see on all the 200 now. They were really just - it was really more of a networking exposure visibility kind of piece. And I'd say the Mentoring Programme is still like that. The people on the Programme are all technically capable, they're all qualified, it's really about creating that support network for them. Ensuring their visibility to chairs to other NEDs to recruiters and then creating that network for them ongoing. This is our sixth one and we'll be launching - yeah, applications have just closed and we're launching in August. So, we run them probably every 18 months because it is a 12 month relationship, so we give the chairs a bit of a rest in between. So, it actually amounts to two years."
16IN,16IN_160,A,I think a lot has been started by more women coming onto boards and wanting to be on boards. I think we've started at the base.
16IN,16IN_161,Q,The gender push?
16IN,16IN_162,A,"The gender push has been huge and then it moved to 'well hang on it shouldn't just be gender, what about people from different cultural backgrounds?' Particularly in Australia, that's huge! Then we've gone to the LGBTIQ - I think I got it right!"
16IN,16IN_163,Q,Well done!
16IN,16IN_164,A,"I felt like there were more letters! And now that's important too. So, then we've gone 'well hang on, we can't just then focus on separate groups all the time, how do we move beyond that?' Then we went to diversity, now we've gone to inclusion and now people are talking about belonging. So, I feel like it's just one of those spaces that just keeps evolving. We're still trying to do it properly."
16IN,16IN_165,Q,Can you explain to me the transition from diversity to inclusion?
16IN,16IN_166,A,"Well I suppose it used to be - well you just need to have more diversity and whatever executive leadership teams in organisations, and then people realised that that's great, but you can't just put diverse people into a group and expect them to feel comfortable and to be able to perform. And, the people - the group also needs to accept them and to celebrate their diversity. So then, we moved into the inclusion which is ensuring that people felt that they knew you were including them. And now, people are talking about belonging, saying well people need to feel like they belong in that group; that if you are different you can belong in a group that maybe a lot aren't different. I think that's - we're really trying to evolve in terms of ensuring that people are accepted for who they are, into teams. It's tough and I think a lot of organisations are struggling with it. It's definitely not an easy process."
16IN,16IN_167,Q,"Do you think - given your - you think right only if diversity, you'd give it a 10 only if people can perhaps include - they could be included in the board - do you think if there is not that capacity, then diversity is not as important?"
16IN,16IN_168,A,"I think that it's more that it's detrimental to the individuals. I think it's detrimental to their confidence, to their ability to perform. So, if you're - you can't just throw people in - it can be harmful if they feel that they're not included and it's a negative experience. But also, you can't expect - and Juliet talks well about this in her book - that you can't just throw diverse people together and expect them to perform, because they don't. You can't go 'well I've got a person from this background, this background, this background all thinking styles', they won't necessarily make the best decision. You've got have a person that can get them to make the best decisions, hence why the role of the chair is vital on a board. Because they're the ones harnessing it. They're the ones ensuring that people can perform and bring their best selves to the boardroom."
16IN,16IN_169,A,"Also, if you've got people that are diverse and not being harnessed, not being - I suppose, challenged appropriately - then you've got everyone just throwing out different things. Then the board won't make good decisions. The board won't get anything done so then you're better having people that can work together, that may not be as diverse, but can still make good decisions. Whether they'll make the best decisions, but better to make good decisions than have a board that's dysfunctional."
16IN,16IN_17,A,"That was our flagship diversity initiative and then the AICDs done a number of scholarships with the federal government for women going through our educational programmes. We continue to do different types of scholarships, federal and state which has been excellent."
16IN,16IN_170,Q,"Right. Okay, so the risk of a board falling into dysfunction because of diversity is real -"
16IN,16IN_171,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_172,Q,"- can't be ignored, so that's important because some people use that as reason for against diversity."
16IN,16IN_173,A,"Well, I'd say for that to happen though, the board needs to be incredibly diverse like everyone different. It's not going to happen if you've only got two people from a different point of view, or three, it's more that they're not going to be able to perform the best that they can. Because they may not feel that they can speak up as much. So then, you've got people that aren't being utilised effectively. So, the dysfunction I'd say, would only come if the whole board was really different and you didn't have a chair that -"
16IN,16IN_174,Q,Could pull it together.
16IN,16IN_175,A,"- could pull it together properly. But it's still dysfunctional if you've got a homogenous board because you're not making the best decisions. That's where groupthink comes in because that's also really dangerous, because people are all agreeing with each other!And we've seen that happen on boards where they've said the issues were groupthink."
16IN,16IN_176,Q,That's right and there's lack of ethics then.
16IN,16IN_177,A,"Yeah, that's another conversation! The ethical piece. I suppose, you've got to find that nice point in the middle; which some boards have done really well."
16IN,16IN_178,Q,I'm just wondering - I'm thinking about - because you're using - like targets are really important - you call them targets?
16IN,16IN_179,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_18,Q,"Do they move beyond gender to say low socio-economic backgrounds, cultural differences?"
16IN,16IN_180,Q,"Targets are really important, a strategy that you use, if that's - if a board says 'I've just all my team, I don't have a coherent base, a cohesive base, I can't just pull everyone from diverse backgrounds, I need some homogenous group, and then later on in two years time or something, I'll be able to get people from different gender backgrounds and different ways of thinking and things like that, increase my diversity', would you accept that? Do your targets allow you to - is it like a 'please explain' rather than a?"
16IN,16IN_181,A,"Well we don't have - you can't - unless you've got government quotas where there's actual regulation and there's consequences, targets - I think for us, we've seen the targets as important. Because we actually have seen chairs call us around the table and when they've achieved it, say that, and we've seen chairs speak in public about the importance of the targets. So, targets are incredibly important and you just hope that there's always a flow-on effect that once you've achieved this in diversity, some are doing it hand-in-hand, you see some boards, they've got great international directors as well that are culturally diverse. But it's yeah, I suppose, with all things we can question chairs, we can say, ""Why haven't you achieved the target you said you would?Talk to us about some of the reasons."" But we can't force anyone to do anything unless there are quotas or some sort of regulation in place."
16IN,16IN_182,Q,Would you support that? Would you think that would be a good idea?
16IN,16IN_183,A,"Organisationally? The AICD doesn't support targets - quotas, neither does the 30% Club because we've seen that we can get there with voluntary efforts. Personally, I've got a different point of view but that's my personal opinion and I can't talk about that because I represent organisations. Because I suppose, I see that - like all things, you put in a quota and you just have to make it work. The arguments against it, which is a concern, is that there are not enough women in senior leadership roles and executive teams at the moment. Which is a huge concern in Australia. We're still not getting women in the P&L roles. Women are still experiencing so many barriers in the workplace and so if just say quotas came in, yeah, the pipeline could be an issue. So, it's - that's a struggle, that space, at the moment."
16IN,16IN_184,Q,"Do you think this is the main limitation on diversity? Achieving diversity, pipeline issues?"
16IN,16IN_185,A,"I still think we've got enough women for the listed space at the moment to have 50:50 really. Because there's only - well if you take out the executive directors, there's only about 1100 board roles on the ASX 200. That's nothing without - so clearly there are enough women for that! In terms of our long-term - the longevity of this and women expanding into other boards, other areas, yeah, it's a huge problem. The pipeline is huge problem."
16IN,16IN_186,Q,"Not just women now, let's think more broadly."
16IN,16IN_187,A,"Oh, cultural diversity. No, they're not getting up to - people with culturally diverse backgrounds -"
16IN,16IN_188,Q,Is it a pipeline issue again?
16IN,16IN_189,A,"Yep. There're too many barriers within - and it's not that there's not people, they're skilled. I suppose people celebrate then women or people from culturally diverse backgrounds starting their own businesses and going with start-up spaces and that is excellent. That is a really exciting space. But it's also a concern. If you feel that in your organisation, your talents aren't recognised and you're not going to achieve your ambitions so you go and start your own business, I think that's pretty crap. So, I'm like that's not great! And women will do that sometimes, not for the best reasons in terms of leaving to be a director, and we're like 'don't do that' because you won't achieve your ambitions if you leave now. You're better to stay longer and then you will get some excellent board roles, but it's because again, they don't feel that they're going to achieve what they want to achieve and so we're trying to say, ""Go get another role. Try to find an organisation that will support you and go somewhere else."""
16IN,16IN_19,A,"We do different ones. In the gender space because I'm really - my role is primarily women - we've done cultural diversity scholarships; we've done rural and remote scholarships so we do try to ensure that we cover some of those as well. We've done a disability sector scholarship programme and then we do other ones. So, outside my portfolio I suppose - in the political term - we've got like a not-for-profit sector leader so we do not-for-profit scholarships and different ones. So, they're not all in the diversity space. It merely depends on the different governments and ministers and what they want to work on. That's some of the stuff that we've done and it was in 2015 though that we said, oh the progress in the ASX 200 we're not moving fast enough, it was about 19.3% and so that's when we called for a target for ASX 200 Boards to achieve 30% women by the end of 2018."
16IN,16IN_190,Q,Do you help people?
16IN,16IN_191,A,"That's not our role. Why we don't, is because the 30% Club overseas does, is because we've got chief executive women who do a really great job in this space. We're really supportive of them and we work with them. You've got the Male Champions of Change, you've got the Workplace Gender Equality Agency going off and trying to do their best, you've got some different organisations in different sectors and so we didn't want to crowd out the executive space,because there's enough work going on there."
16IN,16IN_192,Q,But you might refer them to those?
16IN,16IN_193,A,"Oh yeah, but it's hard. You've got some great recruiters now that are coming up, that you see that are operating just in the diversity space, which is good."
16IN,16IN_194,Q,Oh! Maybe I should interview one of them?
16IN,16IN_195,A,"Yes, so you've got - I've got to think, somebody like Diversity Careers I think they've changed their name though -"
16IN,16IN_196,Q,If I Google Diversity Careers -
16IN,16IN_197,A,"DiverCity Careers I think it is, DiverCity Careers, yep."
16IN,16IN_198,Q,@ it might come up with an old one or something.
16IN,16IN_199,A,"Yep. There's someone that's excellent who's launching her own business called [Rejig, Shavon Savage] 00:51:09 who's - basically it's a software programme that she's going to sell to organisations to map - it's mainly for diversity for women, but it can also help you map your future workforce and the skills that you'll need. You can actually map your whole network because a common thing is that, I suppose managers will say, ""But I don't know anyone in my network with those skills."" That sort of system will allow them to map their network and go 'well actually I know more people than I thought I did'. So that'll be excellent, very exciting for her, she's fantastic."
16IN,16IN_2,A,"Oh, that's all right."
16IN,16IN_20,A,"At that same time, the 30% Club launched in Australia by Patricia Cross who's based here. She said to our then CEO, John Brogden, ""I see the natural home for the 30% Club being the AICD because I can't manage a movement myself."" She's a busy non-executive director and so we agreed to manage it. But in saying that, the 30% Club is a separate entity to the AICD. So, I'm the Executive of it, I manage it, I resource it but the AICD doesn't own it, it's separate. We do our own initiatives, it's very flexible. It's people by working group, like we've got working group members that are volunteers, so it's a very fluid kind of entity which is great. Because we get to do some really amazing stuff with the 30% Club and now, we've got a slightly different target. Although we nearly reached the 30%at the end of last year, we still haven't reached it but we will, we will. The 30% Club is now looking at the ASX 300 and having a target for them by the end of 2021."
16IN,16IN_200,Q,Interesting.
16IN,16IN_201,A,"We support it, but we're just mindful to stay in the board space and although it's all connected, we've just - we can't do everything! Otherwise we'd spread ourselves too thin."
16IN,16IN_202,Q,"Now look I want to ask you a cool question which is, what does board diversity mean to you? Just so I've got it here."
16IN,16IN_203,A,"I still think - I do understand that board diversity is about different individuals with different perspectives, and some of that's demographic diversity from the socialisation process. Some of it is your thinking styles and the way that you come at decisions either as your executive career and what you've - so that to me is the ultimate board diversity. But for me right now, I still think of board diversity in terms of gender and getting more women on boards because we're still at a space where we don't have enough, for me to say comfortably, that we can move on."
16IN,16IN_204,Q,"You know, I've interviewed people who have said that they wouldn't go and apply to be a director on a board if there wasn't gender equity."
16IN,16IN_205,A,I think that's great.
16IN,16IN_206,Q,And they weren't women.
16IN,16IN_207,A,Yep.
16IN,16IN_208,Q,"They said, ""They see it as a flag for diversity and they're not interested in being on a board that is antidiversity."""
16IN,16IN_209,A,Gosh! We need more men to say that!
16IN,16IN_21,A,"The AICD is still supporting the reporting, we're still advocating for more women on boards but we've adopted a stance of 40:40:20 that we think that's best practice; 40% male, 40% female and 20% [unclear] 00:05:08. So that's kind of the AICDs now policy but we support all the activities of the 30% Club."
16IN,16IN_210,Q,"Yeah, exactly! I thought we had a little pocket of -"
16IN,16IN_211,A,"We need more men to put their hand up to say, ""I won't go on a board without women!"""
16IN,16IN_212,Q,Yeah!
16IN,16IN_213,A,Because there's still plenty that do! So that is encouraging. We just need more people to think like that really.
16IN,16IN_214,Q,"We've had a little pocket, I think, of amazing men."
16IN,16IN_215,A,"Oh, there are plenty out there and sometimes they're not getting the opportunities too, because they're thinking differently as well."
16IN,16IN_216,Q,"Yeah, possibly."
16IN,16IN_217,A,"This is for the benefit of everyone, we like to say!"
16IN,16IN_218,Q,"Yes, exactly. So, what do you see as the main barriers to building diverse boards in Australia and how do these work? You've mentioned pipeline."
16IN,16IN_219,A,"Yeah, the pipeline is definitely an issue, particularly in some sectors. It's an issue - where it comes an issue is if a chair - and this is fair enough in some cases - if they need someone with particular skills and that's because of their skills matrix. They've got a board where they cover off the other skills and so they're saying 'well I need - I have to - because of the business we're in, we have to get someone that's been a senior mining executive' and that's when they go, ""We really struggled. We did a search and we couldn't find any women."" I do sympathise and say, ""Yep, I understand."" But I think that's a part of it, but I think a big bit is attitudinal. It's not understanding what diversity is, the importance of it. It's looking at the board and having this narrow view of what a director is and that you need someone that's an ex CEO or an ex C-suite without looking at the rest of the board and saying, ""Well, do we actually need someone like that?  Could we get someone that's been in a functional role that provides a different point of view?"""
16IN,16IN_22,Q,Why have you shifted to 40?
16IN,16IN_220,A,"That is them having a limited view as to what makes an effective director and you'll see great cases where they have recruited women. They've gone 'oh we need this director' but then they've gone 'oh, hang on a sec, that person's going to step off the board in a year, although she doesn't fit the person we're looking for here, she actually fits that person. Because she's so good, let's put her on now and then we can recruit for those skills later'. That's someone being future-focussed and really wanting diversity. A lot are not like that, so I'd say the biggest barriers are still attitudinal."
16IN,16IN_221,Q,"Does your organisation, Australian Institute of Company Directors, does it work on the area of recruitment? Because it seems to be key."
16IN,16IN_222,A,"No. And why we haven't, is because it's a tricky space, recruitment. It's very resource intensive and so we don't really have the resources plus we're mindful that we want to work well with other recruiters. We try not to favour recruiters over others. But in saying that we're asked all the time, why don't we provide lists of directors? Why don't we do this? Again, that goes into the tricky space of endorsing people and vetting them and we don't want - I don't think we're going to move into the vetting and endorsing ever. But we do have Directorship Opportunities portal where we advertise board roles. We are looking at redeveloping that where I think we will be able to do more searchable skills, so it'll be more effective in terms of matching individuals and their capabilities to boards. So, that will be, I think, in the future."
16IN,16IN_223,A,"I do recommend people that have gone through the mentoring programme. I do get chairs come to me and ask for recommendations. But the caveat of that is, that I say, ""These are people that have gone through the mentoring programme. This isn't my membership base. This isn't a full list of AICD members."" We're always asked to provide a list of women for things. It's something we grapple with; we just haven't landed on what's best. We kind of do a bit of this and that and we're still a bit mindful of the risks involved."
16IN,16IN_224,Q,"What about in your training - in your educational programmes, do you talk about this as being a key area and how one might approach recruitment?"
16IN,16IN_225,A,"Oh yeah, definitely. We do sessions with recruiters."
16IN,16IN_226,Q,"Strategic, long-term, not just now?"
16IN,16IN_227,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_228,Q,The future-focussed that you were talking about?
16IN,16IN_229,A,"Oh yeah and that report too, it talks about building your - I suppose developing your director brand and reputation early. Networking with recruiters early, developing your value proposition, not just leaving an executive career and suddenly going 'oh suddenly, hang on I might be a director'. You start to really develop this, 10 to 20 years, even now, starting to think about it. We do stress the importance of networking with recruiters, but I also say don't go to a recruiter and not have an idea of what you want, because it's a small market. You've basically got one shot with a recruiter, if you don't make a good first impression then they don't really help you out."
16IN,16IN_23,A,"40:40:20? Because I suppose that we saw that as - really that is best practice. We've never said that 30% is the ceiling. We've always said it's the floor, it's the minimum, you should move beyond 30%. Why we supported the 30% was because of research, it said that was when minority voices are heard in a group. But really, we do think that it should be 40:40:20 that's fair, that's proper diversity around the table. So that's why we've moved into a general position because we think that's important. All our reporting is still looking at the ASX 200, 300 still monitoring against that 30% target."
16IN,16IN_230,Q,"Oh, okay!"
16IN,16IN_231,A,"So, you need to go to them really demonstrating your skills. because some - they're all different, like humans. Some will coach people more and they will be more understanding. Others won't, they'll be that was a bad impression, no. you've just got to be careful, that when you go into this space,you're prepared. Because it can be a bit gruelling as well doing the recruit arounds, it's not fun."
16IN,16IN_232,Q,"Okay great, we've done that one. We're on the final question! Looking now 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
16IN,16IN_233,A,"Oh, I would like to see them truly diverse, not just in terms of women and people with culturally diverse backgrounds, I would like to see people that have - I would like to see more academics on board. I would like to see people more that have developed amazing, their own businesses on listed boards. I'd really like to see more Indigenous people on our listed boards and private boards. Yeah, I'd really like to just look at a board profile and go, wow! Aren't these people amazing? They're all incredibly skilled and they've all come from such a diverse background. That's what we're aiming for. I don't want to continue looking at board profiles and seeing a whole bunch similar aged white men."
16IN,16IN_234,Q,Exactly.
16IN,16IN_235,A,"So yeah, that's the goal, but 10 years is quite soon! I don't know."
16IN,16IN_236,Q,What do you think needs to happen [inaudible] 00:59:40
16IN,16IN_237,A,"It's hard! I think a lot of different things. You need more women in C-suite roles and P& L roles. You need more guys really understanding the value of diversity. You need more people that are culturally diverse in C-suite roles too. We need good examples of different leads that aren't the all the big personalities. You need to show there are different leadership styles, so there needs to be more workaround what different leadership styles there are, and how that can work in harnessing diversity. There's a whole bunch of issues. You need more men taking up flexible work, parenting duties, you need equal numbers of men working -"
16IN,16IN_238,Q,Social change!
16IN,16IN_239,A,"Yeah, total social change! Because you need more men working flexibly to understand the issues and to take on some of the mental load, because women take on most of the mental load when it comes to the family. So, we need to free up space for that and we need to fundamentally change day-care structures, the money. It costs to put kids in day-care because all that has a flow-on effect to women being able to work. So, I feel unless we have strong government policies and interventions, I don't know if I'm going to see that much change in 10 years, to be honest."
16IN,16IN_24,Q,You said best practice?
16IN,16IN_240,Q,"Okay, so the government policies and interventions are not targeting necessarily the regulations of boards?"
16IN,16IN_241,A,No! It's a bigger [unclear] 01:01:20
16IN,16IN_242,Q,It's social reform! Wow I like that!
16IN,16IN_243,A,"It's like Scandinavia. Well, why can't we do a similar structure that you do get extra parental leave, but you don't get it if the man doesn't take it. So, why can't we basically force more men to take parental leave? Because no matter what organisations say about flexible working, if that's done by 10% of their male employees and 90% women or 60% women or whatever it is, then really that just shows men are still going to keep going up because they're the ones that are there all the time, working fulltime. That shows to them that's what leadership is. Unless that changes, I just - it's too hard for women to then break through, to compete with that. How do we compete with that?"
16IN,16IN_244,Q,The other kinds of diversity? Like cultural?
16IN,16IN_245,A,"I think cultural, it's still going to be really hard until we change the model of leadership and what leadership looks like. Look at government. We've got a whole bunch of older white men now, again, what does that signal to the rest of society? Is it that you're being run by old white men?So, I'm really scathing of the fact that there are no women in the coalition. I think it's despicable. Like, who's going to be Minster for Women? Who are they going to throw in that portfolio? Like Marise Payne is excellent and she's been an excellent Foreign Minister, but surely they're not going to take that portfolio from her? Kelly Dwyer's not there, who else are they going to grab? So, for me, I just think well, unless our government actually reflects society, how do we change society? Because a government like that has no inclination to change society and to change the structures. So how can - as organisations, we can do as much as we can, but we can't really change society to the point that it needs to be at, to get where we want to go."
16IN,16IN_246,Q,Absolutely.
16IN,16IN_247,A,"So, yeah."
16IN,16IN_248,Q,They need to role model -
16IN,16IN_249,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_25,A,Mm-hm.
16IN,16IN_250,Q,- diversity!
16IN,16IN_251,A,"Oh, but yeah, another devastating result!"
16IN,16IN_252,Q,Lovely to finish in a - with a political tone!
16IN,16IN_26,Q,Is there an international standard or something?
16IN,16IN_27,A,"No, there's different views. But I'd say governments have set 40:40:20, there's a lot of different organisations that support that as achievable. And why is because 50:50 is great but due to numbers it often doesn't work 50:50 as well. So, it's important to say, well actually 40% of each is really important and then whatever the 20%."
16IN,16IN_28,Q,Okay and 30% you said was essential for minority voices to be heard?
16IN,16IN_29,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_3,Q,"- for our research on board diversity. So initially, I'd just like to get a feel for the discipline background you're from. What did you - are an accounting?"
16IN,16IN_30,Q,Is there research to support that?
16IN,16IN_31,A,"Yeah there is some research that does support that view. Different groups have done research on that and we stress that that doesn't mean that they're a minority in general, just that within a group if they're the minority voices - they don't - if there's one female director it's very difficult for them to prosecute their arguments. That's when people tend to start to feel more comfortable, when they reach that kind of threshold."
16IN,16IN_32,Q,Is there a particular research that has been influential in supporting this 30% target in Australia?
16IN,16IN_33,A,"There's been different research. I can dig up the kind of stuff that we've looked at because we've looked at lots of different research. For some, it's about the economic argument as well, the financial metric, there's a lot like McKinsey research pieces that have been really important. Deloitte have done some really good ones too. So, I can dig some out and send them to you because there's a lot of different research that we've used in the past."
16IN,16IN_34,Q,"Right, okay. That'd be great."
16IN,16IN_35,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_36,Q,"If you can, I know you're really, really busy."
16IN,16IN_37,A,"No, I can do that."
16IN,16IN_38,Q,That would be fantastic.
16IN,16IN_39,A,"Because there's some really good ones. But in saying that, the economic argument one is an interesting one in that - I suppose some people still really like to see the evidence, they want you to demonstrate that having more women on boards increases financial performance and stuff. But I personally, I find those a bit - it doesn't sit well with me. I feel that women are justifying their positions and men don't have to do that. So, I'm more go the social equity the facts that women go through university at higher rates, perform better at university. So, I find it insulting that women, that we still have to prove that we have to be there."
16IN,16IN_4,A,No.
16IN,16IN_40,Q,It's a power issue not a performance issue.
16IN,16IN_41,A,"Yep. And really, diversity - there's a lot of research also that shows that diverse teams make better decisions because they cover the breadth of issues, that they have people thinking about issues differently. So, I think people understand that diversity is important. I think where we come unstuck is that diversity can be uncomfortable. Some people still don't want to put themselves in a position where it's uncomfortable, when it's more effort to manage a diverse group of people. A lot of people still naturally tend to, I suppose, select people that are like them, in groups."
16IN,16IN_42,Q,Can you talk a little bit more about that discomfort?
16IN,16IN_43,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_44,Q,Because it's a barrier that you're putting up.
16IN,16IN_45,A,"Well it is. I've said that we've talked about this; that diversity can be really uncomfortable. So as a leader, you have to be quite insightful and understand that you're going to be in situations where you're going to be with people that don't agree with the way that you present things, or your points of view. So, you've got to be a leader that develops those sorts of skills to manage that, to take on different points of view, but also to accept it and to look for that diversity. And to want people to question what you're doing because you see that as important. I think not everyone's that insightful! Not everyone can - it's a difficult skill to learn as well; to accept questioning and difference, so it's tough."
16IN,16IN_46,Q,Do you focus on that skill in your education - the education offered here?
16IN,16IN_47,A,"No, although - it's hard. Because the Company Directors Course, which is our well-known course -"
16IN,16IN_48,Q,Core business.
16IN,16IN_49,A,"- is really about developing those technical skills. Although we talk about decision making and the importance of group dynamics, there's a lot to get through in terms of governance,what strategy and risk is, the financial understanding you need to have as a director. So, there's already so much to cover in terms of your technical skills that it's - we can't then focus a huge amount on some of those interpersonal aspects. Like I said, we talk about group dynamics. It's really about what is a director and what's a boardroom. We are relaunching our what used to be Mastering the Boardroom now called Boardroom Mastery programme and I think we're starting to run those in the second half of this year. That will more look at the - you'll be doing the psychological testing, that more looks at your interpersonal skills and who you are as a director."
16IN,16IN_5,Q,Humanities?
16IN,16IN_50,A,"That will go into depth but you have to be quite an experienced director to be accepted onto that. It's not like a public programme where you can just sign up. You need to have developed quite a significant amount of director experience, because they're looking for people that can bring that to this programme as well, and that have a real understanding of what it is to be a director. And are ready to say 'okay I want to develop some new skills, I need to think about who I am'. With the mentoring programme, we're also more focussed now on developing people as directors I suppose as individuals. So, it's about them - some of the workshops we do are around the interpersonal, the active listening, navigating boardroom conflict, communicating effectively, what is power in the boardroom; that sort of thing. So, we’re looking at that because for us, we say it's really important to develop yourself as an individual, not just as a director."
16IN,16IN_51,A,"We're trying to do those with the mentoring programme. I think more and more will be doing more in this space in terms of the EQ side of it. I think gradually we'll be doing more in that space, because we know that it's really important to be an emotionally intelligent human being."
16IN,16IN_52,Q,"Oh brilliant, excellent. That's good, we've navigated through the whole form now, so that's great. I love it. Let's go now, we'll start - the first question is, how have the composition of boards that you're familiar with, changed over time in terms of diversity?"
16IN,16IN_53,A,"I'd say a lot of boards have become more diverse in terms of gender and I would say that's - some are starting to be more diverse in terms of backgrounds, like executive experience and that's due to the current environment. You see more directors with more understanding of digitisation, cyber security, marketing that sort of thing. So, I've seen that change in terms of where they're getting people. But in terms of - if I talk about the listed space, there's still - because of the nature of listed boards they're still looking for people that have had serious executive experience, meaning like line roles, P&L, ex CEOs, running significant parts of the business. So, I don't see that changing in the listed space and considering what listed boards have to do and the public oversight, I don't think that's a bad thing that they want people that have had line roles and P&L experience, that's fine. I think we're still at the starting point because we're stilling trying to get more women onto boards."
16IN,16IN_54,A,"To then move to other elements of diversity, people that think very differently, come at decisions with a very different lens, I don't think we'll see that happening for a few years yet. I think it's at the starting point."
16IN,16IN_55,Q,"So, the cognitive diversity aspect that is at the beginning?"
16IN,16IN_56,A,"I think so. We're trying to do some work on cognitive diversity, some research which would be excellent. Some people understand that cognitive diversity is about your thinking styles and are quite across it. Some chairs are really insightful as to what that means and for them it's more about how can they measure it. So, I'd like to do some resources in terms of how do you understand that? how it plays out in the boardroom? But some do confuse cognitive diversity with your executive background, so you'll talk to them about it and they'll say, ""Oh, yeah, well he's from the mining industry, and he's from financial services."" We'll say, ""Yes, that does influence who you are, but that's not technically cognitive diversity."" I think in terms of boards but a lot of executive leadership teams, they are comprised of outcomes outputs focussed people."
16IN,16IN_57,A,"I think if we can start to talk about it more and educate boards more on that, I think it will change as well. They'll start to see that 'hang on, is it an issue that we've got seven people that are primarily outcomes focused? We probably need some different points of view here'. But again, that goes to the managing diversity and different points of view."
16IN,16IN_58,Q,Exactly which is what we started off with!
16IN,16IN_59,A,"Being frustrated with the process driven person or the person that's all about the evidence. So yes, then you have to do a piece on how do you manage that? How do you leverage that and take that on board? I think there's probably a number of directors are still concerned that having that will slow decisions down, slow the conversations down, and there's a lot of work for some boards to get through. It's a balance, it's a bit of a challenge."
16IN,16IN_6,A,I suppose humanities because my Masters was in Museum Studies -
16IN,16IN_60,Q,"These courses, the Boardroom Mastery and the Mentoring Programme, you'll be looking at cognitive managing, cognitive diversity and what that means [unclear] 00:16:31?"
16IN,16IN_61,A,No. They're more about looking - I suppose -
16IN,16IN_62,Q,EQ?
16IN,16IN_63,A,"- yeah, that sort of aspect. The cognitive diversity, we've just had a lot of conversations and I'm hoping to do a bit of a literature review as to what's out there, understanding what directors understand of cognitive diversity, and then figuring out 'okay, we've done that literature review, we've got an understanding, what are the next steps?' Do we produce resources on boards? Do we do a diagnostic tool that boards can use to assess themselves? So, we're kind of at that starting point. There's been a lot of talk about it and we published a book by Juliet Bourke, 'Which Two Heads?' a couple of years ago which is an excellent book on this."
16IN,16IN_64,Q,Juliet?
16IN,16IN_65,A,"Juliet Bourke. So, she's -"
16IN,16IN_66,Q,B-U-R-K-E?
16IN,16IN_67,A,"B-O - yep, like Bourke Street. She is a partner at Deloitte so she wrote a book that we published and that's an excellent book."
16IN,16IN_68,Q,And that's available?
16IN,16IN_69,A,"Yeah, we sell that."
16IN,16IN_7,Q,"Oh, that's fantastic!"
16IN,16IN_70,Q,"Oh, perfect!"
16IN,16IN_71,A,"I'd think we'd sell it here but we sell it on our website. But she talks a lot about the thinking styles, decision making. Lots about the decision-making process and when we make best decisions, mental fatigue, that sort of stuff. So, we'd like to do more work around that because that was a really excellent book."
16IN,16IN_72,Q,"I'll have a look at that, I haven't looked at that. Do you promote that book - obviously through your organisation because you said it's on your website? Do you tag how many have been sold, what the uptake would have been?"
16IN,16IN_73,A,"I haven't looked at that recently, I can actually. I can talk to our Publisher - because that's been out for a couple of years now, so I can't remember when we launched it, it might have been 2016 even. But yeah, I could look into that. We've got really great feedback around it."
16IN,16IN_74,Q,"So, people are reading it?"
16IN,16IN_75,A,"Oh, yeah. Like I said, there's an understanding. Sometimes it's just how you engage with these sorts of things; that's hard."
16IN,16IN_76,Q,"Because I've been interviewing - obviously I've been interviewing a number of directors and younger directors - meaning in their 40s - I have noticed really a passion for working with difference and it's completed accepted as the norm. It's not seen as a steep curve; it's seen as the norm and of course and why not! Even the way they perform an interview with me, the willingness to challenge and to whatever -"
16IN,16IN_77,A,Yeah.
16IN,16IN_78,Q,"- rather than to be passive respondents, do you know what I mean?"
16IN,16IN_79,A,Yeah!
16IN,16IN_8,A,"- So yeah, a bit of change and shift getting to where I am now. but yeah, I more came from Communication Arts sort of background."
16IN,16IN_80,Q,It just shows me a little bit of how they would be in the boardroom.
16IN,16IN_81,A,I think it's exciting!
16IN,16IN_82,Q,It is exciting!
16IN,16IN_83,A,We’re getting there!
16IN,16IN_84,Q,"I came out of those interviews on a high! It was so - it's interesting, qualitatively different. They obviously really are quite passionate about working with difference. You have it with what they would say, ""To get good problem-solving."" So that’s how they saw it. So, they're not the typical though, I gather?"
16IN,16IN_85,A,"Well, not necessarily. It depends on the sectors."
16IN,16IN_86,Q,"Yes, these are start-ups."
16IN,16IN_87,A,"Yeah. Oh! start-ups? Amazing! They're coming from a very different point of view and business challenges and creativity. The start-ups space is very exciting. And it's hard too, because it's like a lot of things. You can't say it is generational change because I'd say, yeah like my generation, yes, we've grown up in quite a culturally diverse society, we understand the importance of difference. There's a lot of diversity and inclusion talk and leadership programmes and development. So, it'd be easy to say 'well once the older generation are not on these boards, things will change'. But I've actually met a lot - because we're really primarily on the listed space and I've met a lot of older directors who are really insightful, that are really humble, that are excited to learn, that are constantly trying to learn and engage. Which is really important I think as a director, because it's harder to see what's going on if you're out of your executive career for a long time."
16IN,16IN_88,A,"I wouldn't say that age is a barrier because some are very open. It's a personality thing and I suppose I see this in just the gender space in general. I meet some young guys that have got appalling views on gender and where women's role is, and the fact that they're missing out because of women now and their entitlement. So, I see it as attitudinal and it's not generational."
16IN,16IN_89,Q,"Okay, so do you think this could be measured and [screened?] 00:21:37"
16IN,16IN_9,Q,"That's great. The organisation that you work - the Australian Institute of [inaudible] 00:00:52 Management, what does it primarily do?"
16IN,16IN_90,A,"Maybe! Maybe, yes. I suppose you could. So yeah, it’s hard because I think a lot of people have gone 'there used to be a thing of when all the dinosaurs die out' type thing and people would say that about climate change as well. It'll be all okay when this generation gives up power, but it won't be. Unless you're actively pushing it, working out different resources and arguments, prosecuting those arguments, a lot of influencing, we won't get there."
16IN,16IN_91,Q,Oh nice.
16IN,16IN_92,A,"Because there's just too many young people that have got obnoxious views and they're in their 30s and 40s on this. I think a lot of it's an education point of view too. I think schooling - the way that schooling is structured in Australia has a lot to answer for. In terms of our single sex schools! That's all problematic. So yes, some really get it and unfortunately a lot still don't. Hence why you know if we did, we'd have equal numbers of young men doing flexible working as women, but they're not are they? So, they're not staying home to look after their kids. They're saying 'well if I do, I'll be punished workwise' and their bosses might only be in the 40s, they're not in their 60. So, there's - yeah, we've got a long way to go in Australia."
16IN,16IN_93,Q,Are you familiar with other countries?
16IN,16IN_94,A,"Yeah and in our work, we do we work with executive organisations and I'd say Australia is very patriarchal."
16IN,16IN_95,Q,Oh! This is so interesting to hear that.
16IN,16IN_96,A,"I find it a bit depressing and I talk to people that have come to director recruiting in Asia and they'll say there's far more women in executive leadership roles than here. Yeah and of course that's nuance too in places like Japan, that's different. Europe is a bit different in the executive leadership, different in the UK, they really argue for executives to be on boards as well. Whereas here, it's not encouraged as much. There're all different nuances but I think we've got significant issues with the way that we see women in the workplace that we have to overcome."
16IN,16IN_97,Q,"I think I'm hearing a link between women in the workplace and then cognitive diversities, so the capacity to - because we want to be broader than gender diversity in this -"
16IN,16IN_98,A,Yes.
16IN,16IN_99,Q,-@ we want to consider -@ how do you see that connection between gender diversity and Say cognitive diversity and other kinds of diversity?
17D,17D_1,Q,"Good morning [participant].  It’s very kind of you to participate in our research.  Thank you very much.  Can you first of all tell me, what sort of boards do you sit on, and for how many years have you been a board member?"
17D,17D_10,A,"Not greatly, to be honest.  I mean, the boards I am on haven’t changed in terms of personnel in my experience actually, if I think about.  DIG – there was a board in place at the time, then I was added to it in 2015."
17D,17D_100,Q,"It’s lovely.  That’s great.  Are there particular Board functions that diversity can really help with, do you think?"
17D,17D_101,A,"Yeah, the obvious one is framing the service to meet the needs of that community.  I don’t there’s any specific legal, accounting, IT or functional difference that I can think of, but at the coal face, when the service is designed and delivered, that’s where the rubber hits the road, I think, in terms of making sure that’s appropriate.  And that’s – I think that’s fundamentally why we need to know what the needs of all of our segments of the community require.  To design a service around them, for them."
17D,17D_102,Q,"What about, then, the cognitive diversity of the Board?  How might that help Board functioning?"
17D,17D_103,A,"I can’t think of an immediate example or a benefit.  But I’m going back to thinking about projects – the way – my inclination is to think that the way we design and deliver a program, which is a project – that’s a project – might be influence by people who have modern approaches to delivering projects.  A cognitive skill.  But I can’t think of an example where I’ve seen that in action, and a direct link between the success of design and delivery of the program and the cognitive skills that were brought to the table to influence the design and delivery.  I can’t think of one."
17D,17D_104,Q,"Some people think visually, other people – some people think process, some people think outcomes.  Some people think visually, and others think more –"
17D,17D_105,A,Analytically.
17D,17D_106,Q,"- analytically.   and So, do you think that that kind of diversity can help board functioning or influence?"
17D,17D_107,A,"Yes. Of course.  I think that if – we have to think about the way the service would be received by the community that’s it’s intended to serve.  And if we do that without recognition of the community’s capacity to utilise the service, and make good of the service, then we would be deficient."
17D,17D_108,Q,"You’re thinking of the apple versus the – What about though, the actual decision making of the Board itself, and having people who think differently – problem solve differently?  Is that useful, do you think?  Can you think of an example where it’s been, perhaps, useful, or it’s been a problem?"
17D,17D_109,A,"I can’t even think of a particular decision that we’ve come to, that illustrated in the Board discussions, a differentiation in the cognitive approach."
17D,17D_11,Q,"How many women are on that, for example?"
17D,17D_110,Q,The way people think.
17D,17D_111,A,"Which may mean it doesn’t exist.  Potentially a problem, but we won’t know it’s a problem until we see it.  Whether I think it diminished the quality of the decision we made – I don’t think so.  But how would we know?"
17D,17D_112,Q,What about group think?  Do you think you all think so alike that you’re really not thinking out of the square at all?
17D,17D_113,A,"Oh, no.  No.  We’ve got – there’s people who come – who are on that Board, who have caring responsibilities, naturally, for kids and so on.  So they bring a coal-face perspective to it.  I’m not in that situation.  Touch wood.  But – so I bring a – maybe I’m the outlier, actually.  I think there’s quite a number of people who have their genesis, either prior to being on the Board, or right now, in having a direct responsibility to care for someone, as well. So, maybe I represent some of the diversity that wasn’t there prior.  Maybe.  I don’t know.  No-one’s said that to me, but as I think about it, as a person who doesn’t have specific responsibilities to care for someone, then I think I’m in the minority in the Board."
17D,17D_114,Q,"Okay.  So do you think, when you – do you put forward views that might be at odds with people who -"
17D,17D_115,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_116,Q,-@ are in a caring role.
17D,17D_117,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_118,Q,"And so, how is that received?"
17D,17D_119,A,"Well, to their great credit, okay.  And that might bejust me, because I’ve got this honeymoon period.  I’m not sure how long that goes, but I’ve got to say, when I speak, everyone shuts up, and it’s given me at least the opportunity to make my point.  And I present arguments fairly forcefully, and with some reasoning and so on behind it.  And certainly advise the CEO where I think I can see a problem emerging.  I guess we’ve observed – in a practical sense, the funding arrangements for A NFP organisation are very stressful, because they are program based.  They start, they stop.  And as a consequence of that, we have a shifting workforce.  Moves in, moves out.  Delivers the program then moves out.  Which is terribly disruptive for the Board.  Not for the Board – it’s very, very disruptive for the organisation."
17D,17D_12,A,None.  None.
17D,17D_120,A,"So, the organisation has ticked along, and ticked along, and ticked along, and that’s just become part of the culture of the organisation.  But it’s a disruptive part of the culture.  So, that got an airing at the Board level, and we were rolling through the discussion on a “Well, that’s the way it is,” basis, and I said, “Well, that’s nuts, because you just – you’re completely wrenching your organisation every time money runs out, and we need to do a better job in finding more diverse revenue streams.  So, that’s what we’re going to do.”  So, we’ve now got a working parting within the Board to start thinking about supplementing government money, State and Federal, with commercial revenues."
17D,17D_121,Q,"Yep.  Brilliant.  So, was that dreamt up by people who were not from a caring background? Or what was the stimulus for that thinking outside the square?"
17D,17D_122,A,Me.  My observation -
17D,17D_123,Q,"Because you said “Project one – abandon, then you lose all your staff.”  Yeah, so it’s your -"
17D,17D_124,A,"That’s a part and parcel the culture of the organisation, and I think we have to break that nexus because that’s – you know, if you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you always got."
17D,17D_125,Q,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No.  It’s brilliant.  So, maybe there was a bit of group think around that before you came."
17D,17D_126,A,Maybe.  Maybe.
17D,17D_127,Q,"And, so, no, it’s not a honeymoon period."
17D,17D_128,A,"Oh, no.  No.  You get – it’s three hours a month.  A Board meeting.  You get 300 pages to read in the week before.  You go into the zone of thinking and reading, thinking about what you’re reading, and you’re taking notes about what you’re gleaning from the papers.  Then you’re in the discussion that going through the Board papers, and it’s a microsecond of an opportunity to intervene and say something that gets everyone thinking and talking.  That’s what it’s supposed to be like.  And, the Chair gets upset, because we then lose the schedule, because we have an extended conversation, but that’s nothing.  But at the end of the day, you’re passing a motion to do this, and so let’s see some management effort in this and this area, and away we go."
17D,17D_129,Q,"So, the chair – did the chair really get upset because the schedule was changed?  Or is it -"
17D,17D_13,Q,No women.  Yep.  Is this the start-up one?
17D,17D_130,A,Mildly.  No.  I shouldn't have even mentioned it.
17D,17D_131,Q,"There is a hefty agenda, though."
17D,17D_132,A,"Oh, there is.  And there’s a neat three hours.  We’ve all got obligations, of course, so we have to do it."
17D,17D_133,Q,"So, if you weren’t so forceful in your ability to assert your view, do you think that view wouldn’t have been heard?  Did you have to really push it?"
17D,17D_134,A,"I didn’t have to really push it, because I thought it was as plain as the nose on your face that this problem was perpetual, was damaging, and needed to change."
17D,17D_135,Q,And could be.
17D,17D_136,A,"And could be.  Yeah.  Well, I don’t know yet.  We’ve got to do something, and management will come back to us over the next few months with some ideas.  And we’ve seen some ideas, and we’ve had a subcommittee – sub-Board committee meeting to thrash out our approaches to raising external revenue.  So.  Yeah.  Time will tell."
17D,17D_137,Q,"That’s great.  Okay, so, without diversity then, that thinking outside the square wouldn’t happen, so to be honest, I see that as an example of cognitive diversity.  You’ve come with your project management hat on and your business savvy, and brought that to this Board.  And it’s been a long-standing problem, suggesting there’s been group-think about it – we’ve always done it this way, this is how the world is.  So, a good example of how diversity can break through.  Now I’d like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on Boards.  So, you mentioned the agenda – people bringing - concern that people from particular demographic groups might bring political agendas – social/political agendas to the Board, and that doesn’t belong.  Can you – have you an example of that, or something you can -"
17D,17D_138,A,"No, not particularly.  I actually think that the Carers Board is, at this point in time, looking balanced in so far as there’s a range of life experiences, there’s a range of commercial experiences, there’s a range of carer and non-carer experiences, and Scott’s actively dragging to the board the things that we need to attend to that are not within our domain of experience."
17D,17D_139,Q,That’s the CEO.
17D,17D_14,A,"Yep, this is the start-up one.  In terms of La Trobe University, I would image it is a 50-50 mix.  In fact, it’s probably more – in fact I think it is, by recollection, more women on that Board.  And then in A NFP organisation, it’s probably 60-40, men-women split."
17D,17D_140,A,"Yes.  That says to me that we’ve got a reasonably balanced board, and we’re not missing the things that we should be attending to.  Provided Scott keeps doing what he’s doing.  And it’s only six months, so in my view, he is.  Done well."
17D,17D_141,Q,"What about, perhaps, the other Boards you’ve experience on?  Have you any examples from there of where a political agenda might sort of disrupt?"
17D,17D_142,A,"The DIG Board is – we’re very focused on protecting shareholder wealth, so there’s people’s money on the line here.  So, there’s a strong emphasis on prudent financial management, and in that circumstance, because the majority of the products inside DIG are software based - could be why I got involved in this – I was asked to be involved in this – they’ve leached a hell of a lot of money on really bad technology project planning.  And bad relationships in that software development space."
17D,17D_143,A,"So, they were underdone in terms of their experience there, and you probably see it yourself – you get people talking about things they know nothing about, everyone piles on, and it becomes the conventional wisdom, when there is no wisdom in that at all.  Because they haven’t got the diversity that they should have had when making that decision.  So, the cognitive stuff within the DIG Board is really stark.  There’s a capital raiser, a legal, the accountant comes along, I’m there for from IT, and the CEO.  So, from a very small business, narrowly focused, we think we’ve got it covered."
17D,17D_144,Q,Yep.  And you think there’s a bit of group-think there.
17D,17D_145,A,Could be. Could be.
17D,17D_146,Q,"Is that a risk?  Because of that, or do you think it’s -"
17D,17D_147,A,"I just think – it’s a pretty small business, really, and we raise a lot of money, and we do a lot to develop the products.  There’s only a couple of the products are revenue generating now – so they’re all pre-revenues, so they’re in various stages of marketing and testing and all the stuff that goes with bringing a product to market.  So, I think we’ve got it okay.  One of the things that I think we might be going to be found out on is having people who understand the automotive industry on the Board.  So I can imaging that that might be an inclusion – well, certainly it might be a gap now.  So, we’re making a product for the automotive industry, why wouldn’t we have someone from the automotive industry on the Board?  Good question.  Good question. But we’ve got 10 products in the mix, and ones for real estate, ones for employment, ones – there’s a whole heap."
17D,17D_148,A,"Would you have any of those people strong in that industry on the Board?  Maybe not permanently, but this single product, which is our main focus, I think we need that.  But my view might change if the real estate app was going to be a market leader, and so on – we’d need that skill.  So, I think on that point, I’d make the distinction between on the Board and being a reference or a source to the Board.  And, you know, I’ve heard of other Boards where there’s been a deficiency of – particularly in the ITC area – so they invite the IT guy to the Board to make a presentation about that.  And that’s perfectly reasonable."
17D,17D_149,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Yep.  Okay, so the technical aspects can be brought to the Board, just like the consumer aspects for the Carer organisation.  So, what about the style of thinking, though.  Some people are process thinkers, and others are outcome – you know – outcomes, outcomes, outcomes."
17D,17D_15,Q,40% women?
17D,17D_150,A,Sure.
17D,17D_151,Q,"And so, is there a mix of that on this Board – the start up one –it’s called?"
17D,17D_152,A,"No, I don’t think there is actually.  I think we’re all process thinkers, and I guess we rely on the fact that if you get a process, you will get the outcome that you’re looking for.  So, if we do things logically, and systematically, then we’ll get the intent that we started with, as well.  I mean, to a certain extent, we’re all a bit outcome oriented, in the sense that we’re asking Steven – the CEO in that context – what date is this going to happen, when is this going – all the time based questions, and the milestones and the likes – whilst I don’t think any of the Board have a particular bias to either a process mindset or an outcome mindset, there’s a mix of both.  And I don’t think we’d even put a red had on the process thinkers or a green hat on the outcome thinkers because I couldn’t make that distinction anyway."
17D,17D_153,Q,You juggle them.
17D,17D_154,A,Correct.
17D,17D_155,Q,According to the situation.  Yeah?
17D,17D_156,A,"Yeah, yeah."
17D,17D_157,Q,"What about thinking outside the square, just like you did on the Carer Board – although it’s a square that you apply elsewhere – but to that it was a “outside the square.”  Do you have people who think outside the square on this small Board, or are you all very focused on -"
17D,17D_158,A,"I think that’s – we’re all just focused on the release of the products, and the process of getting products through the organisation and commercialising them.  So, no I can’t point to any of us – there’s four of us, so, I can’t point to any of us who represent a radically diverse board."
17D,17D_159,Q,"Do you that could expose you to a loss of opportunity or exposure to risks – something you don’t see, or opportunities you don’t see?"
17D,17D_16,A,"Yeah.  And the president’s a woman, too."
17D,17D_160,A,"Definitely.  But we won’t know.  So, we’re blissfully ignorant."
17D,17D_161,Q,So you don’t care.
17D,17D_162,A,Our blissful ignorance will continue.
17D,17D_163,Q,"So, group think is a virtue in this situation."
17D,17D_164,A,"Well, could be.  Could be.  You know, it’s a risk as well, in the sense that you don’t know what you don’t know, and it only comes to your attention when something goes wrong, I suppose."
17D,17D_165,Q,"Well, you brought it to the attention of the Carers, because, probably, it sounds very likely something will come right because of this.  You know, a major risk for that organisation – HR and financial – is possibly going to be turned around.  At least it’s become the focus of a problem solving strategy, rather than just accepted."
17D,17D_166,A,True.
17D,17D_167,Q,"So, there might be something similar in your small organisation, your small Board – opportunity loss, or whatever.  Do you think is – like, you’re very comfortable with the different things applying in different situations.  It might be because it’s a start up.  Can you help me understand?"
17D,17D_168,A,"Look, I think – in the absence of any other theories about it, I’ll put it down to being a completely different context.  The context for a Board for a start up is very much about rational decision making, prudent use of finance, ambitious capital raising, and producing good products that the market needs.  That you think the market needs.  Out in carer-land, it’s about service provision with limited funds.  Making the same thing I suppose – making the most of what we’ve got.  Cutting our cloth according to the needs of the community and the size of our cloth.  Various – very noticeable difference in risk management and governance, for A NFP organisation.  As a start up, you have a bit of latitude.  By very nature, you have to be brave, commercial, and ambitious."
17D,17D_169,Q,"And you’re unlisted, so there’s not those constraints."
17D,17D_17,Q,"Yep.  Brilliant.  Okay, well that’s good.  But in the start-up environment – that’s been your longest term – no change?"
17D,17D_170,A,"That’s right.  That’s true.  On the A NFP organisation Board, there’s a strong emphasis on risk management, probity, governance, and these things are important.  And as I reflect on the interview with Sue, the Chair, my governance and risk management training from this organisation – AICD – was, I think, part and parcel of what she wanted to do in strengthening the Board, on that aspect of it.  So, on one hand, you see me advocating for diverse revenue streams, which is seen by the rest of the Board as pretty radical, but at the same time, I’m pretty strong on making sure that everything’s going to smell good, look good, and be good, from a risk management and governance perspective as well.  Has to be."
17D,17D_171,Q,"So, it is the context that explains this difference.  And regulatory and social, really.  Because it’s a business risk, I presume.  If there’s a lack of governance and risk management in the Carer, you know -"
17D,17D_172,A,Absolutely.
17D,17D_173,Q,"Serious.  Whereas, okay – an IT product doesn’t sell.  You lost some money."
17D,17D_174,A,"Investors are affected, and the Board’s affected, but others, not necessarily."
17D,17D_175,Q,"And you’ve got other products, hopefully, that will keep your start up running.  So you’ve got four products, or whatever you said."
17D,17D_176,A,"So, in Carers, there’s 736,000 people have an active caring responsibility in Victoria.  So that’s a lot of people who are looking to this organisation – a lot of them don’t know exist, however, but at the same time, those that do look to us for the policy settings, on our influence to government, but also look to us to be the creditable sound voice of their community.  So, you don’t want to be mucking around that, because reputation is hard won and easily lost.  So, I think we’ve got the settings pretty right in terms of our ambition, and what we say publicly and how we act."
17D,17D_177,Q,"Really good.  Excellent.  That makes a lot of sense.  Thank you.  It’s good that you’ve got both those hats, because you wouldn’t be able to compare them, and explain the difference.  It’s great.  Have you any examples of conflict on Boards?  In Board decision making – a conflict."
17D,17D_178,A,"The DIG Board can get a bit fractious at times.  But it’s a personality thing.  A couple of blokes there are having a crack at each other all the time.  Not all the time, but sometimes."
17D,17D_179,Q,"Is that because they’re different – of diversity, or is it?"
17D,17D_18,A,"Yeah, no change."
17D,17D_180,A,"Well, they’re different people, and ones actively involved in the business, and ones not.  Some I’m one who’s not involved in the business, apart from that monthly Board meeting.  So you come in and you hear stuff and you just – you think “What the hell happened here,” and then there’s someone in the room who’s responsible for that.  So, target.  Bang.  What the hell?  So, he gets defensive, and is defending the decision trying to provide context, but at that same time, my colleague is saying “I can’t believe that happened.  Why’d you do that?  Why didn’t we know all this sort of stuff goes on?”  So, they’re being – I’m not the Chair – but there was a bit of ructions going off, so I got the management guy to get the hell out of the room, and invited Steven, his CEO, to bird him after the meeting, to settle him down.  But I’ve also said to Gordon “Just settle down.”"
17D,17D_181,Q,"This is your colleague.  On Board.  Yeah, yeah."
17D,17D_182,A,"I said “Just settle down.  We want to hear the truth from management, and we mightn’t get the truth if we’re going to snap their heads off, every time we get a piece of truth that we don’t like.”  So, we fixed that situation.  Then Liam hasn’t come to the Board since, so I’m not sure that’s -"
17D,17D_183,Q,That’s a good sign or a bad sign.
17D,17D_184,A,"I’m not sure.  But Steven’s the CEO, and the reality is that he’s a Director of the company, and a shareholder of the company, but he’s part of the management team.  I’ve never thought it was appropriate for him to come when the CEO’s coming.  Unless he had a specific project update, I thought he would be an invited guest in and out.  So, to see him turning up for meetings, since 2015, to all of them, I wasn’t happy about that anyway.  Because you do want to speak candidly to the CEO about things.  So, anyway, once they had that fractious – Liam hasn’t been back, and I think it’s been to the benefit of the Board effectiveness."
17D,17D_185,Q,Do you think the Chair might have said something to -
17D,17D_186,A,"He might have.  He didn’t say so.  But when I booted him out of the meeting, and in fairness to Liam, I said get out of the meeting, but if you want to come back in, you’ll come back in on an apology and you’ll settle down.  So, he did that.  He came back an hour later – half an hour later – and said “Okay, sorry about that.  We’ll get on with it.”  But he hasn’t come to subsequent meetings, so that might mean that the Chair or Steven, the CEO, has said “You’re just noise, so stay out.  And if you’ve got things to say, I’ll represent them for you.”  It’s good."
17D,17D_187,Q,That’s great.  Okay.  So that’s really a matter of independence of the Board.
17D,17D_188,A,Yep.
17D,17D_189,Q,"Separation from management.  So, I mean, some inclusions are – versions of diversity – are whether you have independent or dependent Board members, so that’s a good example of how that’s an important variable.  Now, I’m conscious of the time.  So, now recruitment, and then we’ll go to the last question.  So, how are Board members recruited?  God, it’s so different.  You’ve already said how the start up – it was like a network of people who know each other."
17D,17D_19,Q,"That’s what it’s like.  So, it’s stable.  But in the not-for-profit, I suppose you’re fairly new?"
17D,17D_190,A,That’s right. Yep.
17D,17D_191,Q,But on the bigger Board and the La Trobe -
17D,17D_192,A,Carers -
17D,17D_193,Q,Carers and the La Trobe one?
17D,17D_194,A,"The advertised in the Age, and online, I suspect as well.  I made an application and got an interview, and then got appointed.  So."
17D,17D_195,Q,And you had this AICD course under your belt?
17D,17D_196,A,Yes.
17D,17D_197,Q,And you think that helped you in -
17D,17D_198,A,"Oh, I think so.  Yeah.  Well, what else am I bringing?  I haven’t – I’m bringing the IT piece – well that’s interesting.  I’m bringing a bit of life experience, and I’m bringing something that I think Sue and Scott felt was lacking, which was formal risk management and governance certifications, if you like."
17D,17D_199,Q,"And it’s important in that sector, you’ve already identified that."
17D,17D_2,A,"A mix.  The Advisory Board, with La Trobe University.  The MBA area.  A private, unlisted company,– that’s for about five years.  A not-for-profits board – A NFP organisation – that’s about six months.  Yes, so that’s the three."
17D,17D_20,A,"I am new to it.  So, myself and another gentleman came on in, I think, September 2018.  So, I guess that skewed the balance – bolstered the male numbers on the Board, but I don’t think that that’s – hasn’t had a negative impact, or any other impact on the balance of the board."
17D,17D_200,A,"Having said that, I don’t know who else on the Board has got – is a GAICD – which is a Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  But I’ve got that, and just by virtue of time, become a Fellow of the organisation."
17D,17D_201,Q,"Yes.  So, it’s a good thing to have.  Good qualification."
17D,17D_202,A,"Could have been a differentiator, yeah."
17D,17D_203,Q,"Do the Boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity, do you think?"
17D,17D_204,A,"Yeah.  One Board won’t diversify because it’s just got four.  And we’re only – it’s just the size the business.  I think the diversity of the Board will change if the organisation is listed.  So I think this organisation will be tucked into another ASX listed company in the next 12 to 18 months, and I think that’ll be good, because that will bring capital from a broader range of Mum and Dad shareholders and institutional shareholders.  But it will also mean new people come onto the Board, and the biggest shareholders will want a seat at the Board.  Then, as I said earlier, there are some people on the Board who have no appetite for being on an ASX Board.  For myself – don’t know- never been on an ASX Board, so it might be interesting to have a crack.  And then – and I think what I’m trying to do with the Board, even at its current state, of being small and private, is to get them onto the footing of being ready for ASX obligations."
17D,17D_205,A,"So, your transparency, your regular update of changes of shareholder interests, and all that sort of stuff is all formalities you’ve got to go through.  And the risk management of something going wrong, and how to manage crises, and the like.  Will be all important things to learn.  So maybe we’ll recruit for those skills.  If we don’t, we’ll all have to learn them."
17D,17D_206,Q,Yeah.  That’s right.  And quickly.
17D,17D_207,A,And quickly.  That’s right.
17D,17D_208,Q,"Okay, so finally, [participant], looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian Boards, and maybe think about this start up space, and also the established sort of service space."
17D,17D_209,A,"I think the start up I can’t see change.  I think it has the inventor of your product, the one with the most passion about the product is always going to be there.  And they will surround themselves with the people they think that can take that product or service to market.  So, you know, if that’s a product that’s pitched to the Greek community, then yes, there will be Greeks on the Board.  I would imagine.  But in the absence of a specific cultural target, or LGBTI target, or focus on women, or – that will always represent the community in a very precise way on a start up Board."
17D,17D_21,Q,"Okay.  So, how important do you think it is, to have a diverse board?  That’s say, one is not important at all, and 10 is extremely important?"
17D,17D_210,A,"In terms of diversity for the likes of A NFP organisation, it will always have – and should have – people who have care and responsibilities.  So, that’s where you really get the insight you need from the consumer perspective, if you like.  I think it will always have a range of different functional skills, because the business in itself has a finance piece, an IT piece, accounting, a legal piece, and all the traditional functions of an organisation – HR piece – will always be represented in some – in varying degrees, I’m sure.  I think just the natural evolution of time will bring the gender stuff into balance."
17D,17D_211,Q,"You don’t think quotas or targets will have a – like, they’re pretty big at the moment."
17D,17D_212,A,"No, I haven’t thought deeply about it, but I think – I look at the women on the Board, and they’re fantastic.  They don’t need quotas.  They’re there because they know what they’re doing.  And I strongly admire them.  So, personally I’m not big on quotas.  I think it’s merit. If we over cook quotas, then the blokes will be looking for quotas too."
17D,17D_213,Q,"Yeah, affirmative action is not fair."
17D,17D_214,A,"You just want the best people, you know.  I think I’d rather see us increase the size of a Board in order to accommodate a more diverse population, than to specifically exit someone in order to create a spot for someone else."
17D,17D_215,Q,Do you think that the Boards will be bigger in the future then?
17D,17D_216,A,"No, well, I think this.  I think that there will be almost a European style approach, where there will be a management Board, and a Board Board, if you like – a traditional one.  So, there’s – this is a – global European organisations have that multiple Boards.  I haven’t studied it in great detail.  I’ve got some clients who that arrangement and it’s a point of interest, based on my own Board work.  But they talk glowingly of it as being quite effective."
17D,17D_217,Q,In what way is it effective?
17D,17D_218,A,"I think it produces – the evidence is that it produces better company results. I think people – the PWCs and KPMGs have studied the effective performance of European companies with – I can’t remember what it’s called.  I think it’s called just a complementary Board.  But it has a different purpose, but it’s like two Boards working concurrently."
17D,17D_219,Q,At different levels – one’s at executive management level is it? And ones at -
17D,17D_22,A,"Oh, I think it’s eight or nine, for sure."
17D,17D_220,A,"Could be.  Could be.  Not sure.  I need to study this more.  And that’s why I can’t talk too strongly about it, because that would be silly.  But the clients that I have that have had that arrangement, speak well of it, as a positive contribution to the overall effectiveness of the organisation.  And they have pointed me to research by others that sort of demonstrates that it does lead to some over-achievement, by comparison, to other organisations without the double Board."
17D,17D_221,Q,Wonder if it accommodates more diversity?
17D,17D_222,A,Maybe.
17D,17D_223,Q,Yeah. It would be interesting.
17D,17D_224,A,"It would have to, wouldn’t it."
17D,17D_225,Q,"Well, you’d think so, but I don’t know."
17D,17D_226,A,"No, nor do I."
17D,17D_227,Q,"Yeah.  I’d love to see that research.  Did you write it down, or -"
17D,17D_228,A,"No, not sure I did, actually."
17D,17D_229,Q,"Oh, isn’t that a pain.  I know what that’s like.  I will see if any of my colleagues know of that model.  That was so interesting.  Thanks [participant]."
17D,17D_23,Q,Which one do you want?
17D,17D_230,A,No trouble.
17D,17D_231,Q,It’s really good.
17D,17D_232,A,My pleasure.
17D,17D_233,Q,And guess what?  We did it.  On the -
17D,17D_24,A,Nine.
17D,17D_25,Q,"Right, we’ll take nine."
17D,17D_26,A,"Yeah.  I think, particularly in A NFP organisation, and La Trobe Uni, specifically, the community we serve is the community.  So to be representative of that is probably a good idea."
17D,17D_27,Q,Is that because they’re services?
17D,17D_28,A,"Possibly.  I just think the market that they appeal to is a cross-section of the community, and therefore the Board should reflect that.  In fact, I think I’m statistically correct that, the majority of carers are women, so it’s unsurprising that the board would be skewed towards women."
17D,17D_29,Q,Females.  Yeah.
17D,17D_3,Q,"Gee.  So probably, over the last five years?"
17D,17D_30,A,"So, these are – I think that’s probably the way these things should be judged.   In DIG, it’s very much an organisation centred on building technology products for, in the main, a male market.  It’s an automotive product."
17D,17D_31,Q,Okay.  And you came from manufacturing?
17D,17D_32,A,"Yeah.  So, the principal product inside DIG is an automotive product, and it’s targeted at automotive dealerships, and for the market, the owners and the franchisees of those dealerships, typically, are male.  But I don’t think that’s a deliberate connection.  I just think it’s a small company.  There’s only four of us on that Board, and we’re all hand-picked, I think, for a range of skills sets – legal, capital raising, self-ICT, and the CEO, of course, has the CEO role.  So, that explains why, I think, to a certain extent, that explains why there isn’t one or two women on the board.  And I would think, that as that business matures, and becomes potentially a listed company, then that would change, I would think."
17D,17D_33,Q,Why?
17D,17D_34,A,"Because we’ll need a new skill-set, for it to become a listed company.  I would imagine that at least some of that board, possibly even myself, would bow out, because we didn’t have the skill-set required to run an ASX-listed company.  And at that time, because we would then have a more public face, and a larger face to the community, I think it would be prudent to be balanced against the community."
17D,17D_35,Q,"Okay.  So, it’s really reflecting the community, and the market, as well, that you think.  So, that’s on gender diversity.  And what about other kinds of diversity?"
17D,17D_36,A,"Not so important.  Not lost.  We’re – particularly around the Carers, the Board is learning that there are minorities that have a voice and need to be heard.  And we’re making proactive efforts to educate ourselves on the LGBTI community, for instance.  And hearing their stories of discrimination, and the like, but whether that translates into Board roles, I’m not sure I see the connection."
17D,17D_37,Q,"So, how did the Board hear about their perspective?"
17D,17D_38,A,"The CEO - there is a community of carers, in that instance, that are from the LGBTI community, and I think there was a perception within the organisation that our service catalogue was addressing carers as a global group, but not necessarily addressing the specifics of care for different segments of the community.  So, once we’d agreed that that was a problem, we needed to find ways to resolve it, and the starting point for us – and this is a journey that they’ve been on before I joined, so I’m picking up on – not the end of it, but part-way through – we needed to understand that LGBTIQ community better than we did, and that’ll allow us to reframe – not reframe – compliment the existing service catalogue with services that are specific to that community, or at least respectful of that community, so that they can buy in to the general set of services that we offer."
17D,17D_39,Q,"Do you have – I’m thinking – do you have, say people from Muslim background, or Jewish background or other backgrounds where food, and perhaps practices around death and dying might vary?  Do you think, if that’s the case, does this rely on coming from Carers at the point of service who may not be sensitive to this?"
17D,17D_4,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_40,A,Yeah
17D,17D_41,Q,So there's a block?
17D,17D_42,A,"I think so.  I think we’ve either started our work, or we’re well into our work – I’m not sure – in terms of understanding the cultural diversity.  I think we have specific services targeted to the Greek community, the Italian community, and I guess some of the traditional communities that built Australia through post-war Australia.  Whether we’ve groomed our service catalogue to a particular religion, I don’t think we do that, actually.  We’re more focused on the cultural background of people, which could potentially mop up the religious diversity as well.  So, we’re sort of, I think, probably part-way through that journey, in so far as – I’m not sure, I can’t think of a specifically adjusted service that we would offer to the Indian community, or the Iraqi community, or what have you, which would typically be of the Muslim faith."
17D,17D_43,Q,"Okay.  So, if I’m understanding, the cultural diversity – because you’re seeing diversity as serving a community and consumers from this particular Board, then you’re seeing it really as an operational role to identify the service offerings that are needed – the gaps – and the Board would then support that."
17D,17D_44,A,Correct.
17D,17D_45,Q,"So, having cultural diversity represented on the Board is not therefore important."
17D,17D_46,A,"In my view, I’d agree with that.  That doesn’t mean we’re ignorant of it.  We’re sensitive to it, but we do rely on management and executive to bring it to our attention.  And then, of course, there are circumstances where the Board itself brings specific insights to a community that has escaped the notice of management, and therefore that gets specifically documented on minutes, and then the management is sent off to research the needs for that particular community.  So, I wouldn’t say we totally rely on the management team to bring us those unseen parts of that community that we should support.  So, it’s sort of a mixed effort, but in terms of the LGBTI community, I think that one had its genesis from the management team."
17D,17D_47,Q,"So, from a strategy point of view, then, it’s – you’re accommodating what feeds up to the Board, whether – do you look at complaints?  Do you look at -"
17D,17D_48,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_49,Q,You have that information provided to you on which to base strategy.
17D,17D_5,Q,"Beautiful.  And so, that’s three.  And across sectors.  That’s good.  And your background is?"
17D,17D_50,A,"Yes, sort of a qualitative perspective, one of the things that’s in the Board package – is 300 pages – one of the first ones is a carer’s story.  And it’s often a story – not often – it is a mix – they mix them up for us.  They give us a story that is positive about that particular carer’s response to A NFP organisation, and then we get some of the war stories from the Help Desk, and the Service Desk, Customer Service, that says “We let this person down in the following ways,” and so on, and so forth.  So, behind all that’s a database, capturing information we need, and we subsequently get reports to the Board of our general performance and gaps in the service that we need to address."
17D,17D_51,Q,"Good, excellent.  So, do you think there is any situation – you’ve rated diversity as 9, in terms of importance – do you think there is any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating?"
17D,17D_52,A,"No, I don’t think so.  Not at this stage.  I think that whether that rating’s going to be reflected on the cross-section of people we have on the Boards – I doubt it.  I think, we as a Board – well, I can’t speak for them – but my own perspective is that, what is a good thing that a community is represented in the activities of the organisation, whether that translates into Board positions for what we would otherwise see as minority groups, I doubt it because -"
17D,17D_53,Q,Why is that?
17D,17D_54,A,"I think because I think the focus is too narrow.  I mean, Boards are looking for a broad range of experience, and if you’re coming to a Board with a specific agenda item, so to speak, then your capacity to engage effectively in the broader responsibilities of the Board, I think is somewhat compromised."
17D,17D_55,Q,That’s a good point.  Can we explore that a little more?
17D,17D_56,A,"Yeah, that’s fine.  Well, it’s on there – I’m on the Board because I bring an ICT perspective from a strategic one, but my background, as you’ve noted, is pretty diverse.  I’m really old – and wise – with years comes wisdom, as you know, and you spend a lot of time observing, and this all stacks towards your experience.  And so, the corollary of that, of course, is that if you’ve got a fixed agenda item that you want the Board to recognise and represent effectively, then there’s other ways to do it, as opposed to being on the Board, and if that’s your narrow focus, then I think that’s, in some respects, a bit of a distraction to the Board.  I think, as a Board, we all leave our specific – perhaps we don’t.  I was going to say we leave our specific agenda items at the door.  But yes, we bring them, but we bring them with a balance to the broader need of the community."
17D,17D_57,Q,Okay.  So there’s a concern about agenda politics disrupting the Board functioning -
17D,17D_58,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_59,Q,"and So you’re linking diversity with that risk of agenda politics, are you?  So, why do you rate it as a nine, as important, then, given that risk?"
17D,17D_6,A,"A variety of backgrounds.  So, originally a farmer, and into manufacturing.  So, spent a lot of time in regional Victoria running manufacturing plants.  And then managed IT services – formed a business in the late 90s and did that for 15 years, and just built that to a point where I sold it – subsequently sold it.  And then since 2014 I’ve been doing a range of things.  Property development, Board directorships, and running Mullins Advisories, which is a boutique ICT consulting business."
17D,17D_60,A,Because the – yes – so you’re saying that having the diversity on the Board -
17D,17D_61,Q,"So, diverse Boards are important – do you think diverse Boards are important?"
17D,17D_62,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_63,Q,And we’ve got nine.  And do you feel that it’s always been important?
17D,17D_64,A,"Yeah, well, I’ve got a feeling I might walk back from that a little bit now."
17D,17D_65,Q,You can.  Happy.
17D,17D_66,A,"In the context, I was focused on the female-male diversity aspect.  And now we’re drilling into the broader definition aspect of diversity."
17D,17D_67,Q,That’s fine.  So the male-female nine.  So that’s gender.
17D,17D_68,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_69,Q,"But cultural, will we call it cultural -"
17D,17D_7,Q,"Beautiful.  Excellent.  Nice mix.  So, let’s start by saying, first of all, we’re interested in talking to people who work on Boards or organisations that influence Boards, about diversity.  There’s a lot of research and information out there, but what we want is an Australian perspective, taken from the ground up.  So, that’s the point of the research."
17D,17D_70,A,Social.
17D,17D_71,Q,Social diversity.  You’ll give it a different rating?
17D,17D_72,A,I think so.
17D,17D_73,Q,Yeah.  Good.
17D,17D_74,A,"Yeah, back to say, four of five, with the only cavitate being that so long as the interests of that diverse group are represented by the Board.  So, that’s why I’m making that point, that I don’t think there’s a need – certainly it hasn’t been my view that the Board has underdone a particular aspect of its deliberations because of a lack of representation on the Board, provided those other things in place.  That you’ve got a Board that’s aware of the diverse populations that it works with, and that you’ve got an active management team that is focused in on the customer facing aspects of what we do, with a view to bringing those issues to the Board’s attention."
17D,17D_75,Q,"That’s really good.  So, that’s nice and clear as well.  So, thank you.  That’s great.  So, let’s then now say, what does Board diversity mean to you?  Is it demographics, you’ve got gender, but then you’ve talked about ethnicity, social – age – you brought that in as well, because it’s liked with experience."
17D,17D_76,A,Skill.
17D,17D_77,Q,"Skill – yep, functional.  What about knowledge, under – you -"
17D,17D_78,A,"Skill, experience, people’s knowledge."
17D,17D_79,Q,And inside and outside knowledge.
17D,17D_8,A,Sure.
17D,17D_80,A,Yes.
17D,17D_81,Q,"Like knowing the industry, not knowing the industry.  What about cognitive diversity?  And that’s like approaches to problem solving, ways of thinking, ways of understanding?"
17D,17D_82,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_83,Q,Do you think that kind of diversity is -
17D,17D_84,A,I do.
17D,17D_85,Q,@ relevant?
17D,17D_86,A,"I do, actually, yeah.  Because not all of our experiences reflect a modern approach, so I think that – if I think about project management from an ICT perspective, the way we’ve approached projects over the last 20 years has changed, dramatically.  And for the better.  So, I think it is important, again do we want a project management expert who is expert – experienced in today’s approach to project management?  I don’t think so.  But we want to know via the Board, or via management, I was saying previously, that there is a new way of dealing with projects, and we ought to be considering this approach."
17D,17D_87,Q,"Okay, so it seems to me that there’s a really important – that the Board needs to be open to other perspectives."
17D,17D_88,A,"Yes.  Agree, agree.  Crazy not to."
17D,17D_89,Q,"Okay, so that being inclusive is a key feature of a well functioning Board, then."
17D,17D_9,Q,"So, first, how have the composition of Boards that you’re familiar with changed over time, in terms of diversity?"
17D,17D_90,A,Yes.  Correct.
17D,17D_91,Q,"So, inclusivity.  This is good.  So, cognitive diversity, if we think about that, would you rate that with gender, or would you put it with the demographics – you know, the social, cultural?"
17D,17D_92,A,Probably the former.
17D,17D_93,Q,"With gender.  So, nine.  So cognitive diversity it high."
17D,17D_94,A,Yeah.
17D,17D_95,Q,"Okay, it’s good.  And you’ve explained why.  You see representation being an appropriate alternative to having people from different cultural, social backgrounds on Boards in the context of your Boards that you’re talking about, however, cognitive diversity and gender diversity are really important.  And now we’re going to talk about – we’ve got that – so, now we’ll talk about Board functioning, and you’ve mentioned the importance of the Board being open and inclusive.  Can you talk to me about that?  How does diversity influence Board functioning?  That ability to be open and inclusive?"
17D,17D_96,A,"I just think it’s baseline obligation for Board members to have that perspective.  I just don’t think you can operate in a traditional way and you know, I’ve got to say it’s exposure of the Carers Vic Board for me, has been enlightening, in the sense that I’ve had no appreciation of the culturally diverse - Anglo-Saxon white male – the bane of life – you know, within your own cultural circle you mix with people who are of your own sort of making, if you like, so, to stroll into the A NFP organisation Board and see the diversity of people who are impacted by the need to provide care to their loved ones.  And we’re talking about Carers Vic representing the unpaid carers who look after aging parents, disabled children, people afflicted with disease and cancer, and so on and so forth."
17D,17D_97,A,"So, there’s a great amount of love in that and everyone’s capable of love, and I see it in action.  These people giving up their life for other people so they can have a reasonable quality of life.  I think the other key point is to be open to what might be needed.  And in personal service, that’s been an awakening for me too.  Because I’ve had very little exposure to minority groups who – LGBTI communities, certain cultural communities having their specific needs, but that’s becoming more and more a part of my thinking, and I’m sure my colleagues would agree."
17D,17D_98,Q,"Wow.  I’m hearing something like a transformation in yourself, to not only – including a feeling like you belong, in a way -"
17D,17D_99,A,"Well, you have to.  If it’s a baseline skill, I can’t sit on a Board, and say that the needs of the Italian community don’t matter.  They matter to them.  And I’m supposed to be representing everyone’s interests."
18D,18D_1,A,Pleasure.
18D,18D_10,Q,And then another – and that’s two others for - are they in the same industry?
18D,18D_100,A,Yes.
18D,18D_101,Q,"You would do that, yeah?"
18D,18D_102,A,"Yep. One suggestion I did make in terms of a board I was on was we actually went to the community looking for directors and we got more than we needed and I said ‘Well, look, to build a pipeline of directors perhaps put them on one of our committees which is a much safer way of building that confidence and that knowledge. If they have thosediscernible skills or desire to contribute, and their attitude is right, they will develop.’"
18D,18D_103,A,"So with this organisation I have quite a large board, that I give each new boardmember an induction where I spend a certain amount of time with them to take themthrough the organisation’sstrategy and explain their director’s duties to them."
18D,18D_104,A,Another way of building capability is having someone go on as an alternate for someone else.
18D,18D_105,Q,An ultimate?
18D,18D_106,A,Alternate.
18D,18D_107,Q,"Oh alternate, yeah."
18D,18D_108,A,"I saw that happen at a previousorganisation that I was at that, the CEO was on another board, a quite well known board, and he was able to appoint an alternate director and he appointed a young female under the age of 30."
18D,18D_109,Q,Brilliant.
18D,18D_11,A,"They’re all not-for-profits. One is in the allied health services space, one is new economy related, and I’m also on the board of this organisation which is an industry association."
18D,18D_110,A,"Yeah, nominated her to be his alternate."
18D,18D_111,Q,Great opportunity.
18D,18D_112,A,So it was a great opportunity for her. So she got exposure to the operations of a board without necessarily having the -
18D,18D_113,Q,"The responsibilities, yeah, legal. Oh, that’s an interesting way. And was the – could they both be there at the same time so coaching could occur?"
18D,18D_114,A,"Sometimes, yeah, yeah.  I know with this particular board that, related to the company I’m CEO of, I encourage directors to appoint or nominate alternates that we can accept and bring them along."
18D,18D_115,Q,No-one's brought that idea up. That is a great way for cultivating your pipeline.
18D,18D_116,A,That’s a great idea.
18D,18D_117,Q,"So it’s intriguing that it hasn’t come up. Is it a sort of not-for-profit process do you think, or would the ASX listed companies, would they have a problem with that? Or is it just -"
18D,18D_118,A,I don’t think they would have a problem with that. I’m sure that that is practice in some of the ASX companies.
18D,18D_119,Q,"Yeah, okay, I mean the sample is not huge. But it’s great, and I’ll look up some research on it too, alternates."
18D,18D_12,Q,"Great, excellent. Well, that’s quite a period of time to reflect back and I’d like you to do that as we’re going, say oh well look, when I first started on boards 11 years ago it was like this, but now it’s like that. That’s really useful."
18D,18D_120,A,When I was in resources as well as part of the piece to elevate the number of female directors we devised a scholarship program for them where we’d pay for them to do the company directors course.
18D,18D_121,Q,"Yeah, because that’s quite expensive. Like, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, I’ve talked to them and it’s quite pricey."
18D,18D_122,A,Seven grand or something.
18D,18D_123,Q,"Yeah and there’s other courses. Like, that’s the basic one I think."
18D,18D_124,A,Yep. It’s incredible but they got a lot out of it and we actually get some of the big mining companies to sponsor those women to do the course.
18D,18D_125,Q,"Oh, that’s great."
18D,18D_126,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_127,Q,"So that was a way to – because I talked to someone who was an advocate for female engineers to get on boards and she was saying how the pipeline, meaning management, she was referring to management because she’s in the industry, getting women to executivepositions was such a – there were so many barriers. So bringing women along that way she saw as a real – and it was becoming more problematic. She said there are less women in the management pipeline now, that was her view, than in the past, and so I thought oh, that’s a problem."
18D,18D_128,A,That is a problem.
18D,18D_129,Q,"But there’s other ways you can get women on. So the companies support women to get on the board perhaps as an accountant or a lawyer, is that the sort of thing?"
18D,18D_13,A,"Yeah, I’d like to do that."
18D,18D_130,A,"Absolutely, absolutely."
18D,18D_131,Q,"Yeah, brilliant."
18D,18D_132,A,"Big issue in mining is there is a certain cohort of - a fairly sizeable cohort of people in the management ranks who are engineers or geologists, and as you know that calibrates into board ranks."
18D,18D_133,Q,"Yeah, that’s right."
18D,18D_134,A,"But I did some work on that, did a study on it when I was in resources, and the problem in resources, and to a lesser extent manufacturing, is that it starts at like the age of three where – there’s two things, girls aren’t encouraged into those occupations by parents -"
18D,18D_135,Q,And play.
18D,18D_136,A,"And play. They’ve actually done studies of boys building things and girls building things,and the boys build the building or the truck or whatever quicker but they don’t do as good a job as the women, or the girls. But culturally we reward the boys for doing more in terms of volume but don’t reward the girls in terms of the finished -"
18D,18D_137,Q,Quality perhaps.
18D,18D_138,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_139,Q,Or innovation.
18D,18D_14,Q,"Yes, because not everyone can do that so that’s great. So you sit on three and that’d be the total, yep?"
18D,18D_140,A,Yes.
18D,18D_141,Q,"Okay, this comes into cognitive diversity. Someone has – have you – this term, are you familiar with this term?"
18D,18D_142,A,"I’m not familiar with it, no."
18D,18D_143,Q,"Well, it’s different approaches to problem solving, so it’s a kind of diversity that some people are very interested in that’s labelled that. But someone defined it as – or understood it as process versus outcomes, decision making. So some people focus on the outcomes and then reward the number of trucks, and other people are more onto the process. How well was it done, blah blah blah? So that’s an example of two different kinds of cognitive diversity from this person’s point of view, and it fits."
18D,18D_144,A,That’s fascinating.
18D,18D_145,Q,"So in this example it’s gendered, but not all of it’s gendered is my understanding. So some people are seeing that as very important in understanding good problem solving, which you talked about in terms of different – avoiding groupthink and having different skills and backgrounds and different points of view, and so cognitive diversity is taking it just that one little bit deeper and saying how you think about problems, and problem solving."
18D,18D_146,A,And it’s stepping back a bit rather than -
18D,18D_147,Q,But you don’t want everyone to step back too much.
18D,18D_148,A,"No, no."
18D,18D_149,Q,You’ll never get an outcome.
18D,18D_15,A,Mmm.
18D,18D_150,A,"No, no. I think as the manager or decision-maker if you step back and think of what quality actually is,I think that’s quite key. And they’ve  actually done  - resources seems to have done studies in certain occupation categories, and the most famous one is truck drivers, and they worked out that the women truck drivers were a lot better than the men."
18D,18D_151,Q,Really?
18D,18D_152,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_153,Q,Isn’t that against the stereotype?
18D,18D_154,A,"It is, it is against the stereotype. It’s incredible, and they modelled it financially too in that the women are much safer so there’s less OH&S risk and accidents resulting."
18D,18D_155,Q,Liability.
18D,18D_156,A,Yeah. And they’re easier on the equipment so there’s less maintenance costs. So the number of women driving miningtrucks is actually above the all mining female participation average as a result.
18D,18D_157,Q,"Wow, a disproportionate number of women are driving trucks."
18D,18D_158,A,Absolutely.
18D,18D_159,Q,"Wow, that’s really good."
18D,18D_16,Q,And they’re all not-for-profits? So first how has the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?
18D,18D_160,A,Yep.
18D,18D_161,Q,You see that’s not in the newspapers.
18D,18D_162,A,"It’s not, it’s not, but it should be."
18D,18D_163,Q,But I think it’s interesting -
18D,18D_164,A,Oh it’s fascinating.
18D,18D_165,Q,"-@ because it just shows that in a stereotypically male-dominated field Women can thrive, and that would be useful for the – you were talking about the role of media, regulators, media and social expectations, Well here’s an opportunity to modify social expectations."
18D,18D_166,A,"Absolutely, absolutely, and it’s all been costed and proved financially."
18D,18D_167,Q,"Yeah, so I’d love that study. Do you – can you give me enough for me to find it?"
18D,18D_168,A,I’ll email you a link.
18D,18D_169,Q,"Oh that would be great, okay. Do I need to prompt you or are you reliable with – is this good?"
18D,18D_17,A,I think the biggest change has been the move from representative-type boards to skills-based boards.
18D,18D_170,A,I’m reasonably reliable but if you don’t get it within two days  -
18D,18D_171,Q,"So I’ll put truck driver research, that will be enough to prompt you no doubt. So on Tuesday if I don’t get it."
18D,18D_172,A,Excellent.
18D,18D_173,Q,"Yep. Okay, we want to understand how diversity influences board functioning now so let’s move to that. You’ve talked a little bit about it, but we’ll go a bit deeper. Are there particular board functions that diversity can really help with? And can you give me an example, another one maybe? You gave me that good one."
18D,18D_174,A,"I think around strategy, particularly customer acquisition and retention. I think having female perspectives is very helpful from that point of view."
18D,18D_175,Q,"Yep, so females for relations?"
18D,18D_176,A,Yep.
18D,18D_177,Q,"Yep, and other kinds of diversity?"
18D,18D_178,A,"I think around decision-making, and particularly empathetic decision-making. A female board member said ‘Well, what are the implications of actually doing that in terms of supporting the community, and the bigger picture?’"
18D,18D_179,Q,"Yeah, that’s right. And risk to your image."
18D,18D_18,Q,So when did that change happen?
18D,18D_180,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_181,Q,The image of the company.
18D,18D_182,A,Absolutely.
18D,18D_183,Q,Reputational risk.
18D,18D_184,A,Absolutely. So it might on paper make you X hundred thousand dollars but could cost you more if you -
18D,18D_185,Q,And over a long time.
18D,18D_186,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_187,Q,"So other kinds of diversity apart from gender, like the way you talk about to avoid groupthink -"
18D,18D_188,A,Yes.
18D,18D_189,Q,So how groupthink was limited because of diversity.
18D,18D_19,A,It’s been a gradual change over the last decade as directors’ duties have become more onerous.
18D,18D_190,A,"Yeah, and particularly around situations regarding risk."
18D,18D_191,Q,"So really you’re like the other directors that have talked about that. You’ve given me that example so unless you can think of another one that you’d like to give, the earlier one on risk. Okay."
18D,18D_192,A,Maybe the one about the environmental issues because that was a -
18D,18D_193,Q,Reputational risk.
18D,18D_194,A,-@ reputational risk issue.
18D,18D_195,Q,"So do you think there are some functions of the board that diversity has little bearing on? You know, it’s just irrelevant to?"
18D,18D_196,A,"Only to the extent that every person is different and often with handling situations, particularly say board management relations, that’s more of a skill that’s personally inherent rather than gendered."
18D,18D_197,Q,"Okay, yeah, but we’re not just talking about gender diversity, we’re talking about – so EQ, having that distributed across -"
18D,18D_198,A,"Yeah, that’s an EQ issue."
18D,18D_199,Q,"Yeah, so that’s a type of diversity I guess."
18D,18D_2,Q,"- on board diversity. As you know, there’s a lot of information out there on diversity of boards but what we’re particularly interested in is an Australian perspective, so we’re talking to Australian board members and organisations that influence Australian boards to get that ground – on the ground sort of experience, and we’re interested to understand how people think about diversity and also how it’s managed -"
18D,18D_20,Q,So over the past decade?
18D,18D_200,A,"Yeah, yeah."
18D,18D_201,Q,"So even if we’re talking about the accounts, like one person said that all those reports, the financial and governance - she was talking in a health context - clinical governance, those sort of reports, that’s all - the experts can present the reports, they’re facts, but we just – so the board comes in and diversity comes in in discussing how to make sense of it and what to do. But I wonder, because you said society’s changed now and we don’t think that people who are experts shouldn’t be questioned, and so the diverse board will question these facts as presented. Is that something – would you see that diversity even in accepting the finances and whatever, how it’s presented, what’s presented as fact, that a diverse board has a role in that? Or is that an area where oh, it doesn’t matter."
18D,18D_202,A,"Oh, it does have a role in that and that’s how those facts are received, interpreted, and accepted or not accepted. I think diversity is important there. I think from the point of view of individuals skillsets like the analytical skills, reading figures or interpretative skills, those skillsets that are inherent in an individual, I think that’s more individually-based than based on someone’s identity."
18D,18D_203,Q,"Yeah, gender, cultural background, even experience."
18D,18D_204,A,"Yeah, yeah. Because I think that those things, that’s purely individual knowledge and experience coming to the fore."
18D,18D_205,Q,So when you select people for a board do you select them based on those individual characteristics as well as obviously the gender and the social cultural and the educational?
18D,18D_206,A,"I think there’s a strong element of that. But having a mind to diversity is also important, and I think there’d be something wrong if you said ‘Well look, gee we need 10 board members, we need them to exhibit all these skillsets’ and you chose 10 blokes or 10 women. I think something is wrong with that picture."
18D,18D_207,Q,"Yes, there’s some unconscious filter going on there."
18D,18D_208,A,The unconscious bias -
18D,18D_209,Q,"Is showing, yeah."
18D,18D_21,A,"Yeah. There have been a number of corporate collapses over the last 10 to 15 years and it’s come back to what have the directors done? So directorship has become less of a club or a – we’ll put this person on because they represent X or Y in terms of stakeholders, but we need to have a certain amount of expertise on the board to ensure the governance is appropriate."
18D,18D_210,A,"- comes through So you have to be aware of that. I don’t – I think saying ‘Well gee, you need five men and five women’ is Probably over-prescriptive, but you need a substantial number of both I believe, a critical mass of both. So you might have a board with seven Women and three men, So what? as long as there is that balance in some way or another."
18D,18D_211,Q,The critical mass you were talking about earlier -
18D,18D_212,A,"Yeah, yeah."
18D,18D_213,Q,"- which is really important for gender but not important for all types of diversity. but possibly for cultural, the Aboriginal cultural, you gave that example that there needed to be more than one."
18D,18D_214,A,"Yeah, certainly at a workforce level you need critical mass I’ve found."
18D,18D_215,Q,"And is that a percentage? Can we say it’s 30%, or the target?"
18D,18D_216,A,"The accepted percentage I think on boards is, particularly for gender, is around 30%. Workforce we’ve – in resources we thought say with indigenous and with females it needed to be around between 15 and 25 to actually establish that [benchhead] 00:50:42 from which you could necessarily build more."
18D,18D_217,Q,Did you use that as a target in the industry? Was that across the industry?
18D,18D_218,A,"No, no, each company had its own target, and I philosophically have issues with mandated quotas because I think they’re artificial and I think companies need to have the flexibility to choose what’s -appropriate for their operations and what’s not. My belief is it’s a bit like unions saying I want to be on the board, or I want X% of the company industrial democracy et cetera. Well if you want that, same with government, you share the corporate risk if you want to start mandating decisions."
18D,18D_219,Q,"So conflict, now we’re talking - I’ll do the process of conflict, and then the last question I think. No, I’ll do this one. We’ll do selection process. So do people outside the board, or organisations outside the board, influence the selection process for new board members?"
18D,18D_22,Q,"So has this sort of followed from the global financial crisis, so more recently then has the – I know it’s not quite your sector, but the Haynes report, is that influencing the kinds of skills that boards understand are key to governance?"
18D,18D_220,A,"Depends on the board itself. If it’s a representative board the member organisation would have an influence. They might make the appointment, or make the nomination for the board to – or in making the appointment. There might be external consultants that are used."
18D,18D_221,Q,"Yep, the head-hunters -"
18D,18D_222,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_223,Q,"- and recruitment services, yeah?"
18D,18D_224,A,There are organisations like Women on Boards that have lists of availablefemale directors. They’re often consulted. There are women in industry groups that are consulted. There is Women in Super or Women in Mining or -
18D,18D_225,Q,"Right, okay, yep."
18D,18D_226,A,-@ that sort of thing that might be consulted about boardappointments.
18D,18D_227,Q,"Okay, so they’re useful then in certainly facilitating gender diversity."
18D,18D_228,A,"Very, very."
18D,18D_229,Q,"But maybe other types of diversity, perhaps the organisations for accountants, would they help you find an accountant for a board if you wanted one? Are they influential in that way?"
18D,18D_23,A,"It’s reinforcing – I think there were a couple of big collapses like HIH and OneTel that started this particular process, and that was reinforced by the GFC, and the fiduciary duties of directors came into the spotlight as the result of other corporate collapses, and Hayne has brought into focus corporate misbehaviour. So it has been a gradual process of course, but as with everything you’ve had your early adopters. You’ve had your pragmatic group in the middle, and you’ve had the laggards still dragging along behind, but the landscape has changed."
18D,18D_230,A,"I don’t know. Like, I don’t know about the accountants organisations. I knowEngineers Australia -"
18D,18D_231,Q,"Right, they do."
18D,18D_232,A,"- do, or can. Australian Institute of company Directors is another one."
18D,18D_233,Q,"Yes, yes. They’ll put people forward will they?"
18D,18D_234,A,"Well, they might give advice."
18D,18D_235,Q,"Okay, or suggest to some of their members why don’t you go -"
18D,18D_236,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_237,Q,"Yeah, okay."
18D,18D_238,A,And they’re particularly strong on the board diversity piece.
18D,18D_239,Q,"Yes, they have a very good – I’ve interviewed a couple of people there who are members there and it’s very active, people are obviously informally networking all the time there."
18D,18D_24,Q,"Lovely, so the laggards, what do you think keeps them there and is -"
18D,18D_240,A,"Yeah, yeah."
18D,18D_241,Q,"It’s very interesting, the way it operates."
18D,18D_242,A,"Oh, it’s a fascinating organisation and it has managed to be the repository of a lot of wisdom on corporate governance, and they’ve actually cornered the market very well with their company directors and related courses."
18D,18D_243,Q,"Yeah, so they’re a leader?"
18D,18D_244,A,Mmm.
18D,18D_245,Q,"They are a leader, yep. I think let’s go to the final question because I’m conscious of the time, that we’re on the hour. So looking 10 years into the future now how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
18D,18D_246,A,"I think there’s still more mileage in driving diversity, I don’t think we’re there yet. I think if you look at ASX board figures, gender being the obvious example, I don’t think there are enough female directors on ASX."
18D,18D_247,Q,"Any of them, and definitely the 50s."
18D,18D_248,A,Oh -
18D,18D_249,Q,"ASX 50s isn’t it, that there’s none? Four with none, or have I got it wrong?"
18D,18D_25,A,"I think it’s probably a refusal to acknowledge changed reality, and the end of the clubbiness has prompted the demise of the all-male board as well. That’s been a factor.And the need for better governance has prompted the need for diverse voices, and that’s underpinned the need for more diversity on boards."
18D,18D_250,A,"No, the 200."
18D,18D_251,Q,"The 200, there’s four with no women, yeah."
18D,18D_252,A,"Which to me is surprising. There’d have to be a damn good reason in my book for that to be the case, and I could not think of one. And if that’s the case in the ASX 200 it’s obviously the case cascading further down in terms of listed and non-listed companies. I think that diversity in general is something the boards need to pay attention to, as per my original comments."
18D,18D_253,Q,How would that be done?
18D,18D_254,A,"I think it’s that consideration of bringing people on with different points of view, different backgrounds, but ensuring they are, if they’re not already up to speed, they’re willing to get up to speed and you’re willing to get them up to speed."
18D,18D_255,Q,"Yep, okay."
18D,18D_256,A,"I think that will – that impetus for diversity will continue because I don’t think the expectations of directors will diminish, I think they’ll just keep ratcheting up."
18D,18D_257,Q,"Do you think the digital technologies might, because you mentioned them earlier so I think let’s go back to there too, might be a shaper of boards and directors and their behaviours more in the future that it is now, and that that might impact on the way you do things in terms of diversity?"
18D,18D_258,A,"I think so because social media is instant. Once it’s out there it’s out there, you can’t bring it back. So I think that’s really supercharged the more forensic media focus on what companies do. That’s been occurring since arguably the ‘60s, but that just adds an extra dimension to it."
18D,18D_259,Q,"Yes, yes, it’s much quicker, as you said. So I guess it gives less time for the board to think about how they can block it or manage it."
18D,18D_26,Q,Great. Can you talk about that a little bit more because that really is key?
18D,18D_260,A,"Respond, yeah."
18D,18D_261,Q,"Respond, exactly. It’s – so do you think it might lead to reactivity which might impact the growth of diversity?"
18D,18D_262,A,"Look, certainly in politics it’s led to reactivity, hasn’t it?"
18D,18D_263,Q,"I know, this is why I’m intrigued."
18D,18D_264,A,The 24 hour media cycle.
18D,18D_265,Q,"Exactly, so are we looking at this sort of image? Are we looking at this in the future?"
18D,18D_266,A,"I think there are longer term and shorter term issues, and I think if you look at corporate Australia they certainly invested in more spin doctors to combat that kind of thing. Public relations, the - if you have done the wrong thing the best thing to do is ‘fess up immediately and apologise and say we’re going to do X, Y and Z."
18D,18D_267,Q,To fix it?
18D,18D_268,A,"Yeah, whether it’s an oil spill or some other type of corporate misbehaviour. And particularly consumer goods companies like car companies have actually managed to turn – sometimes turn negatives into a positive by responding very quickly on social media with a front foot responsethat provides customer delight. So there are ways of handling social media, but it means that everybody has to be more prepared for that worst case social media scenario, because an activist group can form almost overnight around a single issue."
18D,18D_269,Q,"Yeah, and it can be global."
18D,18D_27,A,Absolutely.
18D,18D_270,A,It can be global.
18D,18D_271,Q,"Yeah, so your stakeholder management has to be really super."
18D,18D_272,A,It does.
18D,18D_273,Q,"Super speedy, super strong. So on the board does it change – does this - like you need people who are digital natives or something on your board because of this? Or is it, I don’t know. I mean, we’re looking 10 years ahead, everyone will be -"
18D,18D_274,A,"Oh, it’s certainly a consideration having someone who knows something about social media in the boardroom."
18D,18D_275,Q,"And confidentiality, maybe that will play a bigger – I mean, I don’t know. Because the openness between the board and the organisation is seen as being important isn’t it?"
18D,18D_276,A,It is.
18D,18D_277,Q,A sort of transparency and -
18D,18D_278,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_279,Q,But could this perhaps change that because of concerns of social media getting in the way?
18D,18D_28,Q,"I won’t even go through the questions, let’s go for it."
18D,18D_280,A,"Depends how it’s done because I don’t think – if you were to go about it the right way you wouldn’t start putting big barriers up because that can be counter-productive in and of itself, but if you’re open you’ve got to do it in the right way, in a way that can’t be misinterpreted, either accidentally or mischievously."
18D,18D_281,Q,So it’s how you manage the communications?
18D,18D_282,A,"It is, it is."
18D,18D_283,Q,More crafting.
18D,18D_284,A,"Well, 10 years ago people would say to you, you need someone with PR or communication skills on the board, but nowadays I think it might even be more specific around social media."
18D,18D_285,Q,"Yeah, yeah. Oh look, thank you so much."
18D,18D_286,A,That’s all right.
18D,18D_287,Q,That is so good. You’re the only person who’s brought up social media.
18D,18D_29,A,"I think - the big danger I think in corporate situations is groupthink, and having a group that are too clubby or too similar can lead to bad decision-making because everyone starts thinking as a pack. So you do need, I think,a level of small d disruption on a board, at least as you’re coming to a decision. Once you’ve made a decision you have to own it, but I think as you’re having that discussion there has to be diverse voices."
18D,18D_3,A,Yes.
18D,18D_30,A,"I think as a generalrule,without over-generalising, the presence of women on boards that had been previously clubby does break up that club somewhat, which is good. I think there has been a bit of a tendency with the blokes to be clubby. I don’t know if that’s biological or learned behaviour, but I think from a pragmatic point of view while there are positives in that, and sometimes you see that in sporting teams, that clubability, there is another side of the coin in terms of quality decision-making."
18D,18D_31,Q,"Right, because that builds a collegiality and that can be, you think, at odds with needing diverse points of view to prevent groupthink?"
18D,18D_32,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_33,Q,Yeah? Is that -
18D,18D_34,A,There’s good collegiality and bad collegiality.
18D,18D_35,Q,"Okay, can you talk about that for me please?"
18D,18D_36,A,"Yeah, sure. I think good collegiality revolves around a common purpose and a common goal, and the joy of working together and exhibiting team work. I think bad collegiality is when I suppose traits of people just going along with things because the group wants to go along with them, and wanting to not break ranks with the group and maintain popularity. That’s bad collegiality."
18D,18D_37,Q,"Yeah, so wanting to fit in rather than -"
18D,18D_38,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_39,Q,-@ contributing a voice to the problem solving?
18D,18D_4,Q,- on the ground. So that’s what we’re aiming to do here -
18D,18D_40,A,"Absolutely, yeah."
18D,18D_41,Q,"Okay. What about - some people have talked about conflict and then it can be a good and a bad thing as well, so I’m wondering how that fits with – it seems to work, your idea of collegiality seems to help to unpack that difference between good and bad conflict."
18D,18D_42,A,"yeah, I think as long as conflict is respectful, as long as people are going into a board meeting with an open mind, and prepared to hear other points of view and put other points of view, sometimes having a different point of view can prompt additional thinking. And you might have completely opposite points of view at a board table but if you’re good at stakeholder management, building outcomes, you might be able to synthesise those points of view into a sensible outcome."
18D,18D_43,Q,Can you give me an example of that?
18D,18D_44,A,I could give you probably a hypothetical example.
18D,18D_45,Q,"Yeah, hypothetical’s good."
18D,18D_46,A,"You might have a situation where you’re building a strategy to take on a particular market or influence a particular group, and one board member will say ‘We should go about it this way and take this approach.’Another board member might say ‘Well,if you do that that way you might offend X, Y and Z and alienate your customer base.’ You might be able to take viewpoint A as valid, and take that overall general approach, but tailor your approach so you’re not offending certain customer segments."
18D,18D_47,Q,"Well, that’s a good example of how - a good hypothetical example of how people say diversity – because one of the questions is are there particular situations where you don’t want diversity, where it can be a problem? For example ,high uncertainty or risk and someone said to me ‘No, that’s when you actually really need it’ and this is sort of where well that second voice helps you to manage the risks associated with your primary goal. So would you agree with that idea that diversity is important for risk management, even in risk situations?"
18D,18D_48,A,"Absolutely, absolutely, because risk is often complex. It’s not we’re going to do X and that’s it. You’ve got to consider all those factors and sub-factors when you’re approaching a complex risk situation."
18D,18D_49,Q,"Okay, so it helps to manage complexity, that’s great. So how important – let’s say we’ve got a scale 1 to 10, 1 is diversity is not important at all, 10 it’s extremely important, where would you put it?"
18D,18D_5,A,"Good, good."
18D,18D_50,A,I’d put it probably between 8 and 9.
18D,18D_51,Q,"And do you feel that it’s always been that important, or do you feel that it’s changed?"
18D,18D_52,A,"I think it’s changed because society’s changed. I think the general public are no longer willing to accept say authority figures because they are authority figures, for example. They expect more accountability from doctors, lawyers, priests, business people et cetera, et cetera."
18D,18D_53,Q,"And is that linked to not to a demographic status sort of thing, the accountability is linked to what, skills or – I’m not sure how to understand diversity and accountability here?"
18D,18D_54,A,"The accountability is linked to core behaviour, and that could be to do with environmental practices, it could be to do with ethical business practices."
18D,18D_55,Q,"Okay, so diverse perspectives?"
18D,18D_56,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_57,Q,"Yep, like the broader perspective, not just financial?"
18D,18D_58,A,"Yeah, absolutely, yeah, that’s it. Triple bottom line."
18D,18D_59,Q,"Exactly, okay, got you."
18D,18D_6,Q,-@ with our questions. So how many years have you been a board director?
18D,18D_60,A,It could be related to diversity itself within the company.
18D,18D_61,Q,"Oh great, okay. And so then that links back to your opening point about good governance and the trends towards good governance -"
18D,18D_62,A,Yeah.
18D,18D_63,Q,"- so thus the social norms and expectations are travelling along with this rapid change in governance as a reaction to some pretty big corporate crises like HIH, OneTel -"
18D,18D_64,A,Absolutely.
18D,18D_65,Q,"- the banking sector. Okay, good. Probably wouldn’t have been picked up, these issues, these corporate issues wouldn’t have been picked up the same way without that social change do you think?"
18D,18D_66,A,"Absolutely, absolutely. I think as part of social change the diminution of respect for people with high status in society, the media has become more questioning since the 1960s, and that’s been supercharged by social media where everybody is now a journalist with a camera."
18D,18D_67,Q,Serious evidence.
18D,18D_68,A,"Serious evidence, yeah."
18D,18D_69,Q,"Right, okay, that’s really interesting isn’t it? I’m going to think about that. So that’s a good mapping exercise. So now what does board diversity mean to you? I’ve got a number of – it can be a lot of different things, you’ve mentioned gender."
18D,18D_7,A,11
18D,18D_70,A,"Yeah look, I think a wide background of different viewpoints and experiences. It’s a natural human trait to recruit people similar to yourself, but if you take the wide view, probably two views you can take, they’re not mutually exclusive. One is to look at the skills based approach and say well look we do need someone with accounting knowledge and we do need someone with legal knowledge, HR, marketing, comms, whatever, without over-fetishising it which can be a problem in and of itself. You can have a problem where you’ve got a lawyer on the board or an accountant and they suddenly get elevated to being the expert and they can stop a lot of things from happening if they’re elevated to being the sole source of knowledge on an issue."
18D,18D_71,A,"But I think having people from a variety of social or occupational backgrounds is also fairly good in and of itself. So rather than havinga board of just accountants, or rather than having a board full of males or females, I think having some kind of diversity is helpful."
18D,18D_72,Q,"I’m interested now to think back to your governance, your original opening line, talked about changing understandings of governance, corporate governance. Have these skills and the social occupational expertise, these sort of things that - these kinds of diversity that you’ve mentioned, are they – have they – has that pattern changed do you think because of the changed corporate governance demands over the last decade that you were talking about?"
18D,18D_73,A,I think it’s changed for two reasons. I think it’s the increased expectations on directors.
18D,18D_74,Q,By whom?
18D,18D_75,A,"By regulators, by the media, I think by society in general. But I think it’s also social change as well, and in particularfrom a gender point of view that women should have the same opportunities as men. Why do you have a board for example that’s all male, or has one woman on it? And people do question that sort of thing, for good reason."
18D,18D_76,Q,"I’ve interviewed some directors who have said ‘If there’s not a gender balance on the board I’m not interested in applying’, because they think it’s a sign that it’s too conservative, they would not fit in and wouldn’t want to. So I was intrigued when I heard that, I thought wow that’s good."
18D,18D_77,A,That’s interesting. People are making those stands these days.
18D,18D_78,Q,"So it’s the social change,and then that’s affecting the supply of directors or the candidates."
18D,18D_79,A,"It is. And look, I did some work on gender diversity in the resources sector a number of years ago and there’s the observation around critical mass, that resources has traditionally been heavily male-oriented for a range of reasons. If you have a site where you’ve got 100 people, and you’ve only got five women, that’s not enough critical mass for them to feel comfortable. And the same thing applies, say,if you’ve got a board of 10 people and one is female that can actually be counter-productive to retaining that female and building more female representation."
18D,18D_8,Q,"Great. And is that with one board, the same board?"
18D,18D_80,Q,"Do you think that works with other demographies like age? Only one young person. Only one person from perhaps an Asian background, a culturally diverse background?"
18D,18D_81,A,"I think it can, but probably less so -"
18D,18D_82,Q,"Oh good, can you -"
18D,18D_83,A,-@ in my observation.
18D,18D_84,Q,"That’s interesting, can you tell me -"
18D,18D_85,A,"It’s only really what I’ve seen over the years that sometimes you’ll get a young director who in some way relishes being on a board with older people, and it really develops them very quickly. I think from a cultural point of view it depends. I know working in resources with indigenous representation the critical mass theory was true, that one indigenous person out of 100, particularly if they’re from a non-urbanised background, that can be problematic in terms of retention, you’d want more. But if, say, a situation if it’s an educated Asian person on a board with educated Caucasian people it’s not as much of an issue. And that’s purely observation."
18D,18D_86,Q,"Okay, but this is what we need. [We’ll find] 00:24:08 the theory and see if there’s more research that’s needed. So that’s interesting. So I wonder how – so someone from a lower socio-economic background, I’m thinking particularly in the not-for-profit sector or with services to people with - communities with disability and single parents, so people who are from socio – so the services are being provided to people who are single parents, so they’re – it’s part of the business to be able to serve that community. So you might really want to have  people on the board from that community, but maybe this is a barrier just like the non-urbanised Aboriginal. If it’s not having the language – I don’t mean the language, the confidence from an education, that an education can give you - do you think education and money is important I guess is the bottom line?"
18D,18D_87,A,I think education is particularly important.
18D,18D_88,Q,"For board members, for directors?"
18D,18D_89,A,"Yeah. And I think being comfortable, and I suppose being accommodated, and the cultural fit being right is important. But your point’s very valid that if your customer base is X or Y having insights from that customer base on the board is quite -"
18D,18D_9,A,"That was the first board, which I’m still on, and I’m a director of two other companies."
18D,18D_90,Q,Important.
18D,18D_91,A,"Yeah, quite important. Female representation – I’m sorry that’s my phone, it might be in the next room. I think one of thearguments around improving female representation is women, at least in certain markets, make more of the purchasing decisions than men so it makes business sense particularly in terms of consumer goodsfor women to be on those boards. And I think potentially with a not-for-profit organisation who is in aparticular community you often have community representatives, which is useful and helpful in terms of the operation of that business but from a legal standpoint they have to be brought up to speed in terms of what the duties of a director actually are."
18D,18D_92,Q,"Would you put them through a course as part of that, like the AICD course, you might pay for that?"
18D,18D_93,A,Mmm.
18D,18D_94,Q,"Is there anything else the board might do to – I’m just thinking let’s say for some reason  you’re really a board that governs a lot of NDIS-type service providers so you’d really want to understand that market and the providers in that market, so would you invest in the education of people so that they can?"
18D,18D_95,A,"Look, the – if you’re going to have an effective board member you have to have some sort of induction process for them, whether that’s a tour of the facilities with the CEO or Chair, or both, a briefing on the business, what its aims are, its history, where it’s planning to go. Included in that has to be some sort of piece on directors’ duties and what it actually means to be a director because you - a) it’s not fair on the person if you don’t do that for them, but b) 00:28:47 a regular board member if they don’t understand the organisation’s imperatives and they don’t understand their legal obligations."
18D,18D_96,A,"I know with this board that I’m executive director, I make it very clear to directors when they come on the board that these are your legal obligations as a director, and I include that in the board papers every time, the extract from the regulator’s webpage as to what your duties actually are as a director."
18D,18D_97,Q,"Right, so as the director of operations you would be very keen then to have a board that can help you with strategy?"
18D,18D_98,A,Yep.
18D,18D_99,Q,"So I’ll go back to the - would you then think it would be a  strategic investment for the organisation to try and find – build candidate capability so that they can come on the board? So – because I’m justthinking some people might be a long way from being able to perform director duties but their community is so important to your strategy, would you invest in terms of scholarships, get them through uni, get them – like, a five year, 10 year plan to get a good director?"
19D,19D_1,Q,"Good. That’s not a problem. I was thinking, oh, I hope I set it up properly. All’s good. Well, it’s so lovely to meet you. Now, we’re going to talk on board diversity. And I’m particularly interested from - you’re speaking from The Australia Institute’s point of view, yeah?"
19D,19D_10,A,"Look, I’d have to say 10, to be quite honest with you. And the reason that I say that is it’s always hard to build diversity on boards."
19D,19D_100,A,"Oh, sorry, you just froze."
19D,19D_101,Q,Yeah.
19D,19D_102,A,I’m not sure because I don’t necessarily do that myself.
19D,19D_103,Q,I’ll do that. I’ll look at that. That’s a good lead. Okay. So now can we explore a little bit about what diversity means for you? We’ll just try and clarify that concept from your point of view. You’ve been talking about it - how you’ve been talking about [overtalk] 00:27:30
19D,19D_104,A,"Okay. Well, everyone has different [unclear] 00:27:34, life experiences, and all those come into a board to help you govern and address issues that come up in the everyday board, things that happen. If you don’t have a diversity of experiences and skills, well you can’t address the issues that you need to be addressing as a board. And a good example to me is most boards need an accountant to make sure somebody understands the figures that they’re being presented to by management. You really need to have somebody with some sort of legal background. And I’m just thinking that Menslink, an organisation that I work for, needs to have somebody who really understands mental health issues, and how people can work in that environment."
19D,19D_105,A,"ACT Government needs somebody who understood how legislation worked, and how the things that happen at Cemeteries Society need to be dealt with. If you work in an organisation that has its core business is around staff, you need somebody who’s got HR skills. So you need to bring in those people that understand the operations of the organisation, but also have those - and I’m going to talk about with business, you’ve got your core business and your non-core business. And I’ve always, because I’m an accountant, I always stick into non-core [unclear] 00:29:10 so I understand the HR, I understand the finance, I understand the risk management of an organisation. You need to have that balance."
19D,19D_106,A,"But I don’t necessarily understand - if it was an IT organisation, for example, I wouldn’t be very good with the IT skills. If somebody started talking to me about “should I be using WordPress or Drupal?” I’d be going, “I have no idea.” So then you need that balance of skills. And I really think that diversity brings that into an organisation. And it’s critical. You can’t sit on a - an IT company’s a good example. You can’t have a group of accountants sitting on the board of an IT company because it won’t work. They all understand the finances but not the [unclear] 00:29:50."
19D,19D_107,Q,"Yeah. But if they didn’t have a person with financial understanding, they wouldn’t be able to be effective either. Is that - you see legal and accounting as being essential for everything, for all boards?"
19D,19D_108,A,"And you’re right. If you’ve only got one person that understands the accounts, and I have been in this situation too, the management or the solvency of an organisation is the responsibility of every board member. You can’t delegate that responsibility by going, “Oh, yeah, there’s an accountant that sits over there. So she looks after that.” Everybody has to contribute to understanding that, and knowing what’s happening in that organisation."
19D,19D_109,Q,"Good. Do you think a particular kind of diversity might matter more than others, like is it important to have skills diversity? That’s more important in gender diversity? Or something like that? Are there particular kinds of diversity that matter more than others?"
19D,19D_11,Q,"It’s always hard to, sorry?"
19D,19D_110,A,"Look, I think you have to have [unclear] 00:31:11 and skills-based. You have to have the right skills around the table. But then, as part of that, diversity is reality important as well when developing those skills. Because if you have some - a group of people that have all exactly the same skills, you get into that groupthink. And that’s something that I think is a tragedy for boards because, if no one’s challenging [unclear] 00:31:40 no one’s asking the right questions, no one’s thinking differently, you end up in all sorts of trouble."
19D,19D_111,Q,"Can you talk a little more about groupthink for me, and an example perhaps of where it’s been a problem, just so we can understand how it works? It’s good."
19D,19D_112,A,"Well, I’m just thinking of one particular board, and there are a number of people that sit around the table, and there was a particular issue [unclear] 00:32:12 that was challenging that people didn’t necessarily understand. And everyone - nobody wanted to be the voice that went, “I don’t understand this.” And they all sit there and they nodded, and went, “Okay, okay.” And then when we all got out of the meeting, people would go, “I really no idea what was going on.” And you’d sort of go, “Well, why didn’t you speak up? Why didn’t you ask the dumb question and go, ‘Seriously, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t think this is a good idea’?”"
19D,19D_113,A,"And because nobody did, and [unclear] 00:32:48 organisation, which nobody actually agreed with. And they didn’t want to go in that direction. But because nobody had had the courage to sit up and say, “I don’t understand the reason why we’re doing it,” it got through. It was proved."
19D,19D_114,Q,Wow. Okay.
19D,19D_115,A,"Yeah. And I found that really interesting, because I sat there and I - that particular group of people, I was secretary, so I was the observer. And I could see that everybody had these problems, and nobody wanted to say. And as the observer, you can’t sort of butt in and go, “Surely someone’s got a question.”"
19D,19D_116,Q,"So, now, that’s really interesting. Do you think the chair has a role to see that, and to try and manage groupthink? How can it be managed?"
19D,19D_117,A,"Well, this is an interesting - it’s a problem too because if the chair’s out of the groupthink, they’re outside and seeing what’s happening, and I suppose one of the challenges - I don’t know if I’d even call it a challenge. But one of the things I do when I go to board meetings is I do challenge things a lot, and I do - even sometimes, I think, “Well, that’s a really dumb question.” But I’m going to ask it anyway because I don’t know if everybody else around this table understands it. And, you know, there’s been - I was thinking about another really interesting issue that I had recently in an organisation, and it was too hard for the [CA] 00:34:29 to deal with, so we put it on the table at the board, and I was chair at the time."
19D,19D_118,A,"And I said, “Well,” - nobody else knew what to do. “My view is that you have to take some very serious action about this matter. We cannot, as a board, allow this to go unaddressed.” It was an HR issue. “We have to be seen to be taking a positive action here because this involves people that give us money. From a risk management perspective, if it was front page of the Canberra Times, who’s going to give us money anymore because this thing has happened?” And everyone was quite horrified that I took such a strong approach to the issue. But I really believed that for the fundamental good of the organisation, you had to - there was a lot of hurt, short-term hurt that belonged to [overtalk] 00:35:23."
19D,19D_119,A,"And I see a lot of people who aren’t prepared to do that. They don’t want to go, they don’t want to be thinking differently to other people. And, again, it comes back to that if you recruit the same people that you’re friends with, it’s hard to have a challenging conversation, and get people to think differently. And you see it a lot, you know, “I’m mates with this person, this person, and this person. I think they’d be really good for our board. I know that my good friend, Margot, would like to come and do this too.” And you end up with a whole range of similar people with similar thoughts and similar [unclear] 00:36:02 similar background that don’t challenge the thinking that’s happening on the board. And that’s why diversity is so important."
19D,19D_12,A,It’s hard to build diversity on boards.
19D,19D_120,Q,"Yeah. Look, this is so interesting because, see, [Participant], I’ve had a couple of people talk from boards, and they’re passionate about conflict. They think conflicting views are fabulous, and they think it’s a problem if the board doesn’t express conflicting views. And so they made me sit back because they actually seemed to really believe it and live by that mantra. Would you join them in that? Is that the sort of picture you have? Or is it a bit -"
19D,19D_121,A,I would [unclear] 00:36:46 and I’ve sat on some boards with [unclear] 00:36:49
19D,19D_122,Q,"Oh, hold on."
19D,19D_123,A,[Unclear] 00:36:53
19D,19D_124,Q,"It’s frozen. It’s freezing. I’m not sure. Maybe it’s right now. Like, I’m losing you. It’s good now."
19D,19D_125,A,"Yeah, so I’ve sat on some boards where conflict has been absolutely [dysfunctional] 00:37:10, and it’s been - they’ve been a complete disaster. And I definitely would say I don’t think conflict is necessarily a good thing. But then there’s that balance. I don’t think groupthink’s a good thing either when you’ve everybody in the room who thinks the same, has the same background, has the same skill, knowledge, and experience, and they all agree. So there’s that fine line to walk, and I think my view is rather than being in conflict with other people, and I have seen people that believe that, that you’ve got to have everyone [fighting] 00:37:42 to get the best out of them. I don’t agree with that."
19D,19D_126,A,"But you do have to have courage. And you do have to be able to ask hard questions, and put the time into reading your board papers, to understand the issues that are coming forward, and to be able to say, “I don’t really get this. Can you explain it to me?” Even if you have a conversation separate with the chair, or separate with the CEO, and say, “I don’t understand this but I want to make sure I make the right decision as a board member. Can you explain it to me?” And to challenge other board members to say, “Did you understand that? Can you explain it to me? Because I don’t get it or I don’t know what to do or I don’t know what to say.”"
19D,19D_127,A,"And I think you’ve got to have - if you’ve got 15 people on your board, that becomes more difficult. And you’ve got to have the courage to go, “I don’t get that. I don’t understand why we’re going to do this. Can someone explain it to me?” But, in my mind, that’s not conflict."
19D,19D_128,Q,"No, that’s a different way."
19D,19D_129,A,Yeah.
19D,19D_13,Q,"Oh, build, yeah."
19D,19D_130,Q,"They were talking more - as you were saying before, characterising it - devil’s advocate. Definitely playing the devil’s advocate. So bringing in different points of view. But they referred to that as conflict, like conflicting points of view. Probably not agro. That wasn’t what they were -"
19D,19D_131,A,[Overtalk] 00:39:08 that doesn’t work.
19D,19D_132,Q,Yeah. And so culture of the board’s really important.
19D,19D_133,A,Yes.
19D,19D_134,Q,"And they mentioned courage - courage to speak your own voice, and put your case, that was really important. But, you see, I think I’m hearing with you the culture of the board is really important for people to feel that they can express vulnerability. “Look, I don’t understand that. Can you explain?” So can we talk a little bit about the culture of the board, that really helps to make the most of diversity decision-making?"
19D,19D_135,A,"[Overtalk] 00:39:48 a chair will [never provide unclear] 00:39:51 opportunity to speak, ask a question, “No, I don’t understand,” or even have a dissenting view. So [as] 00:39:59 chair, I was pretty cool in making sure that everybody has the opportunity, particularly things that are not easy, are complex, that there’s a decision involved that the board has to make that has risk involved, and understanding the nature of that risk. Like what will go wrong if we do this? What will go right? What’s the - in everything that a board does, in all the decisions that it makes, how does that risk upon risk upon risk build? And when comes the point that the organisation can’t take any more? Well, what’s risk tolerance, I suppose is where I’m coming out. And board members need to make sure they understand that."
19D,19D_136,Q,"And would they need to agree, like all have, “Right, this is how” -"
19D,19D_137,A,"Well, it’s fabulously if everyone can agree. But I think, at times, the majority - it has to be majority. And you’ve got that written in your constitution about if you don’t agree, how you address that, you know, do have a vote of show of hands? Do you have a secret ballot? Whatever that is. And that’s critical as well. You’ve got to have that mechanism to be able to resolve things that you don’t agree on, because you’re not always going to agree."
19D,19D_138,Q,Okay. So this instrument may well be very important for managing diversity on the board.
19D,19D_139,A,"Oh, absolutely."
19D,19D_14,A,"It’s been one of our biggest challenges, particularly when I was at the universities. And not so much in regard to a gender balance, but more a, I suppose, cultural balance on boards. And ACT Government put in place some very strong requirements for boards, so ACT Government bodies to generate that diversity. And whereas we’ve got diverse people who added - sometimes their insights were absolutely brilliant. I can think of a couple of instances. But it’s generating that ongoing - so they lacked the experience to be real contributors to the board. But when they could contribute, their contributions were absolutely fantastic."
19D,19D_140,Q,"Yeah, I don’t have - is that a highly confidential document?"
19D,19D_141,A,A constitution?
19D,19D_142,Q,"Yeah, is it -"
19D,19D_143,A,"Yeah, no, most - all charities have to publish them on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission website."
19D,19D_144,Q,Australian Charities - Charities and -
19D,19D_145,A,"Not-for-profit and - ACNC. Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission, yeah."
19D,19D_146,Q,"Yeah, Committee?"
19D,19D_147,A,Commission. [Unclear] 00:41:58
19D,19D_148,Q,Okay.
19D,19D_149,A,"So they’re all on that website if you’re a charity. In regards to private organisations, I don’t think they do have to publish them, but they can choose to. Many do, especially [legal] 00:42:15 based organisations."
19D,19D_15,A,"And I’m just thinking about a really good issue that was a really good highlight when I was at the university. We had a post-graduate student, because there were requirements that some of the students - two students and two - a professional staff member and an academic staff member had to sit on our university council. And one day, some questions came up around students and student engagement. And the post-graduate student sort of just sat up and went, “From my perspective as an international student,” and it was wonderful to have someone to have that different view of what the other 15 people sitting around the table who, quite frankly, were older –"
19D,19D_150,Q,Yep. And so that’ll have some ideas about how the strategies that they have to resolve conflict?
19D,19D_151,A,Yeah. It should be embedded within those documents. It should be [overtalk] 00:42:29
19D,19D_152,Q,Okay. I’ll have a look at some. Yeah. Fabulous.
19D,19D_153,A,"Yeah, I was going to say there’s also the set of standard - I’m just trying to remember what they call them - standard sort of constitutions, I think, published by ASIC -"
19D,19D_154,Q,I’ll have a look at that.
19D,19D_155,A,"- that [unclear] 00:42:45 should have in a constitution. Replaceable rules, that’s what they’re called."
19D,19D_156,Q,Replaceable rules? Okay. Thank you.
19D,19D_157,A,Yeah. So you can choose to put them in or not. But they sort of come up with a standard set of - what generally there should be in a constitution [overtalk] 00:43:02
19D,19D_158,Q,"That’ll really help because that gives sort of the guidelines that shape the behaviours of the boards, and the chair’s role, I guess. Do they -"
19D,19D_159,A,Yeah.
19D,19D_16,A,"There was a mix of genders. They were primarily Anglo-Saxon. They had no idea what it was like to be a student in 20 - I’m going to say ’16, let alone an international student who had come from overseas to learn at our university. And that perspective was so important in what we did because we want to engage with international students. We want to bring more international students into our university. And to understand it from their perspective was just an incredible insight. And she was great. That lady was just wonderful, like, very smart, very articulate, and just an international student, female. She had it all."
19D,19D_160,Q,"Yeah, the authority of the chair, what the chair can do? Oh, great."
19D,19D_161,A,Mmhmm.
19D,19D_162,Q,Do they specify the relationship between the CE and the chair as well? Do they -
19D,19D_163,A,"Some do, yeah. Not all of them, but some of the more complex ones certainly will. I was going to say at the university, well, at UC, they were called standing orders. So I don’t know if you can get a copy of those at your university."
19D,19D_164,Q,"Oh, should be able to you, yeah. I will."
19D,19D_165,A,"Yeah, they should be there somewhere."
19D,19D_166,Q,I will. I’ll ask those above me. I’m sure they’ll be able to do that.
19D,19D_167,A,[Overtalk] 00:43:46
19D,19D_168,Q,"Okay. So there’s also - do you think that there’s particular board functions that diversity can really help with, and others that it really gets in the way of?"
19D,19D_169,A,"No. I’m just trying to think. I can’t think of anything off the top of my head. I think diversity makes for better decision-making because it’s bringing all those skills and experiences and differences that you’re being exposed to throughout your career, and that can make a difference. But I can’t think of anything specific that it’s good for and it’s - or easy to see that it’s good for."
19D,19D_17,Q,"That’s great. So do you think if that person wasn’t there that no one on the board would’ve thought, “Gee, I wonder what it would be like for our international students?”"
19D,19D_170,Q,"What about risk? Do you think it’s good for managing risk, diversity?"
19D,19D_171,A,"Oh, yes, I do, because I think people need to have those experiences to understand what - because risk is this really [unclear] 00:44:58 sort of people talk about risk. But it’s not clear till you get down and you think, “If I do this, what are the things that can go wrong? If I do this, what are the things or the opportunities that will go right?” And everybody can have a different, “Well, what about that?” And go, “Oh, but have you thought about what would happen if, you know, this happened or that happened?” And I think, “Oh, no, I didn’t think about that. But, yeah, no, that’s absolutely right. That could go wrong. And what would we do if that were to happen.” So I think that’s really important for boards."
19D,19D_172,Q,Yeah. Okay. That’s great. And so there’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity in board functioning. Is this what you might call cognitive diversity?
19D,19D_173,A,"It could be. Yeah, possibly. If they look at more of the - I suppose this is skills base. It’s about, again, those experiences that you’ve had because you can’t - unless you’ve been exposed to it, it’s hard to sort of think about it, if that makes sense. So it’s not necessarily, I suppose, looking at cognitive abilities, such as something that you don’t think about while you’re sitting there. But if I worked in an organisation that’s dealt with fringe benefits tax, and I’ve seen what can go wrong when you do get it wrong, you know, I’ve got a much better [unclear] 00:46:31 understanding of that, but that’s because I have that knowledge. It’s not because I studied tax law, for example."
19D,19D_174,Q,"So if I’m - because some of that was fading out, so I’ll sort of see if I can repeat the key points and my understanding there of what you’re saying. So different skills, your different experience, means that you will think about things differently. And it’s not that you have some innate different way of thinking. It’s your skills and experience that shapes how you think about a problem. And you gave an example of, you know, if you’ve come from a certain background, you will see different risks that other people may not see because of the background that you’ve had. Is that sort of how you -"
19D,19D_175,A,"Yeah. That sums it well, I think."
19D,19D_176,Q,"Oh, good, just because you were fading in and out. Not you, but my internet is not perfectly stable, I gather, from this message on the screen."
19D,19D_177,A,It could be here as well.
19D,19D_178,Q,"Yeah, I think it’s struggling. We’re geographically challenged her, despite our technology. Anyway, we’re nearly there, [Participant]. We want to understand - we’ve done that. We’ve done that. Okay. So minority groups - before we move to our final questions, minority groups, are there are - like you’ve talked about Aboriginal, people from Aboriginal background. You’ve talked about the state government, how it sets up a process for managing people with different - from different minority backgrounds. But what we haven’t talked about is people from different economic backgrounds, social-economic, like people, you know, from very low socio-economic backgrounds."
19D,19D_179,A,"I was going to say one of the things when I was on the board of the Women’s Centre for Health Matters, we looked after an organisation that was [Women and Prison] 00:48:47."
19D,19D_18,A,"No, nobody would’ve given it a moment’s consideration."
19D,19D_180,Q,Women’s Prison?
19D,19D_181,A,"Yeah. So we had people who we gave the opportunity to come and sit on our board that had not necessarily had a good life, [overtalk] 00:49:03 from very low socio-economic backgrounds and had spent time in the jail system, to help them build their skills to be able to go and set up an organisation that they were very keen to do, which would help women in prisons here in the ACT."
19D,19D_182,Q,That’s a great example. So you sort of mentored them? Your board mentored them?
19D,19D_183,A,"Yes, we did. Can I just say that actually was a personal challenge for me because you sat with someone on the board that had a very different approach to the way that I would have approached things. And I just have this thing in my head when she started talking, and using language that, you know, not that you find it shocking because you hear it on the telly and that all the time. But it sort of rolls around. But, all of a sudden, I’m sitting in this very formal board meeting, and I’ve got someone speaking in a very different way. And it does take you back in time. And then you go, “Well, actually, that’s okay, because that’s who they are, and that’s the way that they talk. And this is the reason why they’re here.” Because if they had’ve gone and done that on any other sort of formal board, they probably would’ve got kicked out of the room."
19D,19D_184,Q,How would’ve they got kicked out? How would’ve that happened?
19D,19D_185,A,"Well, you don’t hear people speak like that."
19D,19D_186,Q,I know. I can see the situation. I was just wondering how -
19D,19D_187,A,It was a very different way of talking.
19D,19D_188,Q,"Yeah, and not content. Was it meaningful, though? Did it add - like the meaning was clear? There was content there. It wasn’t just offensive language?"
19D,19D_189,A,"No, there was content there. But, yeah, there was a lot of offensive language thrown in [overtalk] 00:51:01 completely different background, upbringing, and life that I’ve led that I’ve never been exposed to. You know, I haven’t spent time in prison. I drive past it in the car. And her life experiences were really challenging. And to be able to help them build what they wanted to build in that organisation, and start talking to them about governance, and how they manage things, and what they needed to do, and how they needed to set it up, and how they would build a constitution, was great. I think [Women and Prison] actually won some awards here in the ACT."
19D,19D_19,Q,"Isn’t that interesting, and, yet, a significant share of your market is from there, yeah."
19D,19D_190,Q,Wow. Okay. And you were instrumental in that?
19D,19D_191,A,"Oh, I was part of the board that brought them into the organisation that then helped with that."
19D,19D_192,Q,"That’s fantastic. So, now, the board you were on that sort of mentored them, what was that board - what was it doing?"
19D,19D_193,A,"It’s called the Women’s Centre for Health Matters here in the ACT. So they do a lot of - not so much going out, and they’re not like Menslink. They’re not an organisation that deals with clients, and does mentoring and counselling. They do a lot of report, a lot of stuff around gender diversity. Now, one of the things that they did do, which was really cool in the ACT, they do a lot of research into gender-based issues. So a good example was women who get pap smears in the ACT, if you’re disabled, tables don’t go - you’ve got to get up and get onto the table. So they did some research into that. And now in the ACT, all doctors surgeries have to have tables which can be lowered to help women access those services."
19D,19D_194,A,"There’s a lot of stuff around women’s health that is based on statistics they’ve built around men, rather than women, in the ACT. Because nobody ever does the stats. So they do a lot of social determinants of health work in the ACT, and how that impacts women from culturally diverse backgrounds. And, as I said, that’s women with disabilities. They did a lot of auspicing. I can never get the word right. It’s called [React] 00:53:17 Women with Disabilities in the ACT, and their organisation’s being - they’ve [unclear] 00:53:22 with ours to learn and share those experiences."
19D,19D_195,Q,"Oh, wow, this is amazing. You’ve opened up a beautiful area. I’m just - we can’t keep going on. I can’t hold you too long. So I’m thinking what I’d really like to know for the purpose of this research is taking the line of this board that you have mentored to become a board of its own, by - can I just say tolerating their differences in language, which could be limiting in broader contexts, do you feel that you need to help them to become more mainstream in their language so that they could negotiate with a minister, they could communicate with the public?"
19D,19D_196,A,"Yeah, I think that was really important. Because if you’re going to [unclear] 00:54:17 the minister to ask for funding, they certainly need to do that, yeah. And those were some of the issues that we worked with them on. And they were great. Look, and from perspective, I thought it was hilarious. Like it was just so different."
19D,19D_197,Q,"That sounds like a very, very rewarding experience for you -"
19D,19D_198,A,"[Yeah, that’s right] 00:54:38"
19D,19D_199,Q,"- and for your board. Yeah. Oh, it’s amazing. Wow. And we are - I believe that we will be interviewing a board that has people with cognitive disability on it. So that will connect with -"
19D,19D_2,A,"Oh, okay. I wasn’t sure whether it was about The Australia Institute. I sit on a number of boards."
19D,19D_20,A,"Exactly. That that wasn’t - as I said, that wasn’t the mindsight that they were sitting - the framework that they were working in. Another good example was I used to do student - not data assist - student - sorry. I’m just struggling. I’m having a moment."
19D,19D_200,A,[Overtalk] 00:54:53
19D,19D_201,Q,"Yeah, I’m very interested in that scope, the full breadth of diversity, and how people on boards might manage it. So thank you. You can other examples there. I think let’s move to the final question, because I’m conscious of the time. We’ve only got five minutes. Now, [Participant], looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see diversity of Australian boards?"
19D,19D_202,A,"Oh, look, I think 10 years is [unclear] 00:55:23 cultures, there needs to be [unclear] 00:55:26 as well. There needs to be [unclear] 00:55:28. Again, experience of - you know, I think when you’re working on a community board, you need to be representative of that community. And so whatever that looks like, that’s what your board needs to look like. [Overtalk] 00:55:45 -"
19D,19D_203,Q,Okay.
19D,19D_204,A,"- 10 years down the track, I think that’s what should be all boards."
19D,19D_205,Q,"Yep. And as you said, you started with this. You were started by saying Australia is, you know, much more multicultural now, culturally diverse. And therefore boards are more culturally diverse, and need to be. So you’re saying, “Right, that trend is continuing. And who knows what other trends with emerge?” But in 10 years’ time, we’ll have a lot of baby boomers in nursing homes. That’s a big change. I wonder, yeah, anyway. Okay."
19D,19D_206,A,All right then.
19D,19D_207,Q,"So, [Participant], that was really fabulous. Thank you so much."
19D,19D_208,A,That’s all right.
19D,19D_209,Q,Is there anything else you’d like to say before we close?
19D,19D_21,Q,Advocacy?
19D,19D_210,A,"No, [unclear] 00:56:33."
19D,19D_211,Q,Okay. We’re frozen again. I think the technology is saying goodbye.
19D,19D_212,A,Lovely to meet you.
19D,19D_213,Q,"Yeah, lovely to meet you, [Participant]. Bye-bye. Thank you."
19D,19D_214,A,Okay. Bye.
19D,19D_215,Q,"Jeez, I hope that worked."
19D,19D_22,A,"No, it was the student conduct committee."
19D,19D_23,Q,"Oh, right, governance, yeah."
19D,19D_24,A,"Yeah, so students that had gotten into trouble for various reasons. And, again, to have a member of the body, it was compulsory that the student member of council to be an undergraduate and who has a graduated, member sit on that committee with a group of academics, and I was the professional staff [unclear] 00:05:54 to understand what it was like to be a student. And we’re looking at it from our experience of being a student 30 years ago."
19D,19D_25,Q,"You know, [Participant], I’m getting a bit of a lag. Are you getting - how’s the audio for you?"
19D,19D_26,A,It’s not too bad.
19D,19D_27,Q,"I’m thinking I might cut the visual, and see if that improves things, my visual. I don’t like doing it because I like to see body language. But I’m losing some of what you’re saying. Unless if I turn this off - let me just see that if I turn these things off. I’ll put my hand up, and that means I’ll have to do something like turn the visual off. But let me just try turning off other things that might interfere. I haven’t actually - I’ve done it between just La Trobe in here. I’m at my home office. And I’ve done it between La Trobe in here with no problems. But this is not good, and I don’t want to lose it. Okay. Let’s try. I’ve cut everything else off. Sorry. If you just continue - you were giving another example around governance, you know, university students who have got into trouble. And it started to - your voice started to just disappear. So we better start that story again."
19D,19D_28,A,"I was just saying that at the university, we had a student conduct committee. And we used to make sure that there was a student member on that committee, because the world’s a very different place to when I went to uni 30 years ago. And they had some great insights too on what it’s like to be a student, you know, some of the issues we had around car parking, and the frustrations that they had when they had to find a car park. Whereas I got in early every day because I had to start work at eight o’clock. So you didn’t see it through their eyes."
19D,19D_29,Q,"Okay. So I still - some board members have been talking about subcommittees, setting up subcommittees for things, and that way they could capture different stakeholder groups. But I think what’s interesting, what I’m hearing from you, you wouldn’t have thought to ask these questions, the board itself -"
19D,19D_3,Q,"Well, speak to both, whichever you think - wherever you want to go, really."
19D,19D_30,A,No.
19D,19D_31,Q,"- without these voices being on the board. So to Say, “Oh, look, you can set a subcommittee up to do that, and pull people in who are not board members.” that wouldn’t work in these situations?"
19D,19D_32,A,"No, not necessarily. And I’m just thinking most of the subcommittees that I’ve been involved with, they generally are made up of board members. It’s very rare to get a subcommittee that might bring somebody else in. And just some of the ones that I am thinking of, they might’ve had the occasional expert who might come in, so a finance committee, for example."
19D,19D_33,Q,"Well, that’s good. Your value of 10, as a board member - now as a person from The Australia Institute, how do you see, first of all, that organisation influencing boards, and would you give it a 10 or would you change your rating from when you put that hat on The Australia Institute."
19D,19D_34,A,"Yeah, The Australia Institute, so how does it impact other boards?"
19D,19D_35,Q,"Yeah, do you think it influences other boards? Does it seek to?"
19D,19D_36,A,"I think it doesn’t seek to. But I think just the nature of boards, and when you have a group of people who sit on a board, it tends to not only be one board that they sit on. They’ll do a range of boards. And I’ve found that anything that I learn in one organisation always flows through to the next organisation, whether it’s a way to present financial report, whether it’s a way to report risk, whether it’s just a mechanism or a process from a governance perspective, or a structure of how it works. I learn from everything that I do, and I take that to everything else that I do. So, there’s always this crosspollination of ideas and thoughts and things that happen. So that’s how you influence other boards that you sit on."
19D,19D_37,[Overtalk] 00,"10:26 and this is, I think, the issue that comes up, it’s the same people who sit on sort of the same, similar boards, particularly in a small place like Canberra. Everybody knows everybody. It’s all the same group of people. And it’s very hard to break into that group of people, and to build that diversity that you need to build on boards."
19D,19D_38,Q,"Yeah, actually, that’s a really good point because Canberra’s not as big as, say, Sydney or Melbourne, your pool is even smaller."
19D,19D_39,A,"And most of the boards that run here are usually not-for-profit type organisations the [unclear] 00:11:05, yeah. Whereas the big businesses run out of Melbourne and Sydney, and there’s not a lot of big business here. There’s government boards. But, again, you’ll tend to find that it’s the same group of people that sit on all the boards around town."
19D,19D_4,A,Okay.
19D,19D_40,Q,"That’s interesting. I hadn’t thought of the geographic barrier. But given that Canberra is the seat of our federal government, it probably means that people from Canberra tend to sit on those boards. Is that right? Or do people fly in?"
19D,19D_41,A,"People do travel quite extensively to come and sit on the boards. And, again, when some of the government boards that I’ve dealt with from the federal government around - we talk about rather than ACT Government, it tends - I’ve always found it tends to be who you know. So somebody within the department, very senior, will know somebody from some other department or someone that they’ve worked with in the past, and they’ll bring them in to sit on the board, because nobody wants to have a board that the chair and CEO don’t get on."
19D,19D_42,Q,So it’s very much the - people who have worked for the government in the bureaucracy - so we’ve got a cultural -
19D,19D_43,A,Absolutely.
19D,19D_44,Q,-@ similarity?
19D,19D_45,A,[We do] 00:12:17.
19D,19D_46,Q,"Very interesting. Okay. So I hear from you, [Participant], that we’re not really - The Australia Institute is not part of our discussion. It’s we’re talking about boards, so board experience. So we’ll focus on that. I’ll be clear now. And I need to work through those questions only. That’s good. So do you feel that it’s always been this important - you raised it as a 10. Do you feel it’s always been this important, diversity of boards?"
19D,19D_47,A,"When you say “always been this important”, I think it is important, but I think the importance has grown with the change in demographics in Australia. So I think that as we become a more multicultural society, we need to bring those differences into the way we govern organisations. Because we’re not governing for one group of people anymore. Whereas, in the past, it would’ve been very homogenous. Whereas now, it’s very different. And I think we need to have that reflected in the way that we govern."
19D,19D_48,Q,So is this diversity about representing the population’s demographics’ interests? Is it a sort of a representational thing? Is that why it’s important?
19D,19D_49,A,"I think that’s part of it. But, again, I think it comes back to having that experience. So when you’re on a board, and another example that I’m thinking of is when I was on the ACT Cemeteries Authority board, we were talking about building in the - and it wasn’t a chapel but it was like a room or an office or some sort of building where people could go and celebrate someone’s life. So we were trying to take the [unclear] 00:14:22 salvation and religion away. And the reason that we were doing that was to be able to cater for all faiths and all communities. And there’s a lot of people now that don’t necessarily have a faith, but they still want to have a memorialisation for their next of kin."
19D,19D_5,Q,"Now, first of all, I’ll just ask an opening question. What I’ve found is that if I just say what I really would like to hear from you, then you talk, and then I’ll sift through the questions where we’ve missed out. But it’s much better if you tell your story, rather than we have these fragmented responses, that’s what I’ve found. So what sort of boards do you sit on?"
19D,19D_50,A,"But then when we started - when we had people from different cultures that sat on the board, they had very different perspectives about what that should look like. So instead of building that - and I’m going to call it chapel sort of like building, you know, where you have your person at the front, you have all the chairs, you have a lectern to the side where someone may stand up and speak - they talked about having a circular room where everyone wouldn’t necessarily sit in their chair but they would come in, they could stand or they could sit on the floor, because that’s the way their culture, they did those things. And I thought that was really important to be able to make it fit for purpose for everyone within our culture to be able to use it."
19D,19D_51,A,"But, again, when you’ve got a group of - and I’m going to say white Anglo Saxon people, we only have been into churches and buildings that have all the chairs set out that you sit down in. I’ve never ever been to a funeral where I’ve sat on the floor. But, you know, again, we would’ve never considered that in the way that we worked, or in our plans for the people. And, again, you get an architect that doesn’t necessarily have that background to be able to make that building useful for everyone that you want to use - who wants to use it, sorry."
19D,19D_52,Q,"That’s really interesting. So we’ve got the multicultural - the demographic trends in Australia bringing with it religious and other sort of cultural values. So that’s been a driver for the - so it’s not the more importance that you give to diversity, but the different kinds of diversity come into play. Is that what you’re saying? So it’s always been a 10. Is that what you’re saying? It’s always been 10 to have diversity, but there’s more kinds of diversity that have become important because of our demographic trends?"
19D,19D_53,A,"Yes, I think so. Like, everyone’s focused very much on gender balance on board. So most boards I sit on now, they all talk about gender balance. If a woman leaves, you have to replace a woman. It was one of the reasons why I sit on a lot of boards because I tick that box of not only being female but I’m also an accountant. So [overtalk] 00:16:59, so to speak. So that’s very big. And every organisation that I’ve been involved with, they talk about making sure they achieve that 50:50 gender diversity because that’s representative of the world that we live in. But in conversations about getting an Indigenous person to sit on our boards, we have a few of those, but’s really hard to find the right person who wants to come into the organisation. And then I just don’t know whether the other cultural aspects are even necessarily thought about a great deal."
19D,19D_54,Q,"[Participant], you’re the first person to talk about - I’ve interviewed quite a number of people now, and you’re the first person to mention the Indigenous board member."
19D,19D_55,A,"Oh, wow, really?"
19D,19D_56,Q,"Yeah, people aren’t - they haven’t been on a board with one. So can you - you mentioned there are barriers. Can you talk a little bit about that, and about how the Indigenous people that you know got onto boards? That’d be interesting if you know that."
19D,19D_57,A,"Yeah, look, I do find it really interesting because it’s one of the areas that I’ve tried to work a lot with on - so I think tapping into Indigenous organisations that are embedded within universities, they are bringing people through that - because you can’t just put someone on a board because they tick the diversity box. Boards are skills-based, and I truly do believe that you have to have the right set of skills on a board to govern the organisation. So you need to tick the two boxes. You need to have someone with the right skills who can also meet the diversity requirements. And that’s where I think we engage better with universities, for example, as a way of getting those skills in."
19D,19D_58,A,"The chancellor of the University of Canberra was an Indigenous gentleman, Tom Calma. He was great. Look, and I think he was specifically targeted at the time to come onto our board via - we had a wonderful vice-chancellor, Stephen Parker. And he went out looking for someone. And we use that a lot as being the first university in Australia to have an Indigenous chancellor. So it was really important for us. And Tom had a great background in working on boards. He’d worked with government. He’d worked as an advisor to Philip Ruddock, I think it was, many years ago. So he had all those including co-relationships as well. But they’re [unclear] 00:19:37 to find those people."
19D,19D_59,Q,"So do you know how - it was just personal networking, was it, to find him?"
19D,19D_6,A,"Okay. I was going to say, at the moment, I do look after the board of The Australia Institute. I’m the company secretary here. I’m not actually a member of this board. I sit on the board for an organisation that does mentoring and counselling services in the Canberra region. I previously was the secretary to counsel at the University of Canberra. I’ve sat on the board of another Canberra-based organisation called the Women’s Centre for Health Matters."
19D,19D_60,A,"I believe so, yeah. He started before I started at the university. But that was my understanding."
19D,19D_61,Q,"So we’re going to get to recruiting activities, and how that might shape the boards. Maybe, you know, you’re talking a bit about it now. How are people recruited, and how do you think that influences the diversity of the board?"
19D,19D_62,A,"Yeah, again, look, it’s really interesting. Most of the boards that I’ve worked with or for generally recruit through somebody that they know. “Who do I know that might like to come and sit on this board?” And generally, most people - unless they’re thinking about diversity, they’ll recruit like. So I just find that - and it’s even an unbiased thought process, that they know someone who’d like to sit on the board they think will be really good. So they invite them to come in. Usually they come up to see how they all go, and then they get put into the board at the next AGM. Again, ACT Government has implemented very strict rules around that."
19D,19D_63,A,"So you must go through a process now of when you want to fill a government position and this [unclear] 00:20:59 so the local government, not the federal, you must go through a process where the position is advertised. You must go to the Office for Women to see if they have - and they have lists now in ACT - to see if there are any appropriate women on that list who you could put onto your board. And then we go through, I think, it’s the Office of LGBTQI. So we have to go to them as well to find out if there’s a person in that community that would like to sit on or board. And then we have the Multicultural Office. So we also go there."
19D,19D_64,A,"So you’ve got three sort of - well, four hoops that you have to jump through before you can appoint anyone to your board. And if you pick from outside of those lists that are generated within government, you need to have a real good reason why you couldn’t find the skills in any of these other areas."
19D,19D_65,Q,"Wow. So are there targets to support this? Or it’s just justify if you don’t have people who are - you don’t have 50% women, like a 50% gender mix, and then you have someone from the LBD - well, you know, that one - and what were the other ones you said? The Indigenous -"
19D,19D_66,A,The Multicultural Office.
19D,19D_67,Q,Multicultural.
19D,19D_68,A,"You go to those three organisations first to see if they have someone that they would recommend putting - and these recommendations all go to the Minister to sign off on. So unless you’ve got a good reason for picking someone sort of that isn’t any of those things, yeah, they don’t necessarily get a guernsey in Canberra. So that’s - and it’s like, you know, [unclear] 00:22:39 the labour organisation talking all the time that they had to implement quotas to build up the number of women. This is very similar to that. So ACT Government’s basically implementing quotas about, you know, “You need to employ from these lists and, if you don’t, why should I, as the Minister, sign off on somebody else?”"
19D,19D_69,Q,"Actually, I -"
19D,19D_7,Q,"Are they sort of not-for-profit, these ones?"
19D,19D_70,A,[And it’s actually working] 00:23:00.
19D,19D_71,Q,"Isn’t that great? So how long has this been going on for, these -"
19D,19D_72,A,"Look, probably a couple of years now."
19D,19D_73,Q,Really? Okay. So since about two thousand and -
19D,19D_74,A,"Well, I think since Andrew Barr got into power. So Katy Gallagher was the chief minister here, and she resigned and went to the Senate. I’m thinking that was a few years ago, 2016. And then Andrew Barr took over. And one of the things he implemented when he got into power was that this is the process we shall follow when we appoint boards."
19D,19D_75,Q,This is for state -
19D,19D_76,A,"Yeah, state-based."
19D,19D_77,Q,"Yeah, state-based. Because I remember hearing Penny Wong talking about four years ago, five years ago, at a Women on Boards thing. And she said, you know, she’d be given a list of potential candidates for a board, and she’d say, “Where are the women? You can’t tell me” -"
19D,19D_78,A,"Yeah, [overtalk] 00:23:56 because federal government tried to do a similar thing. And I know they set up a list, I think it was called on Women on Boards, because I put my name down for it. And then you never even heard anything again. So it actually never generated anything that it was [unclear] 00:24:13."
19D,19D_79,Q,"So the federal, you think, was less effective than the state."
19D,19D_8,A,"They’re a not-for-profit board, yeah. And I used to sit on the board of ACT Cemeteries Authority, which was sort of a trust organisation for the ACT Government."
19D,19D_80,A,"Absolutely, and I think it was because at the time, which would’ve been the coalition, refused to mandate any gender balance on boards or any other -"
19D,19D_81,Q,So the quotas have been very effective -
19D,19D_82,A,I believe so.
19D,19D_83,Q,-@ from your point of view.
19D,19D_84,A,"Yeah, [unclear] 00:24:33."
19D,19D_85,Q,"That’s good. You’re the first person from Canberra that I’ve interviewed. So I’m thinking, ooh, maybe we better make an effort to interview different states because here you’ve shown us that state government in Canberra has shaped something quite different to anything that I’ve heard here in Melbourne."
19D,19D_86,A,"Yeah, and I think we’ve got quite a good - if you wanted to try and google it - the lists have quite a good document around the [creating] 00:25:06 of boards."
19D,19D_87,Q,Okay. This is the Canberra - the ACT government?
19D,19D_88,A,"Yeah, ACT. That said, things have changed a little bit since the last time I was involved in it. I’m just thinking. I’ve been out of the university now for just over 12 months, so I’m not quite sure what’s happening the last 12 or more months."
19D,19D_89,Q,"I’ll look it up, and then I’ll look for similar things in other states. So that’ll be a good lead. Because you’re an example of how it has worked when - because it’s coupled with quotas. Please explain if you don’t comply. Then that’s really good. Okay. That’s great. So now let’s -"
19D,19D_9,Q,"Good. Well, given your perspective as a board member, how would you rate the importance of diversity on boards? If one is - sorry, zero is not important - one is not important at all, and 10 is extremely important, where would you put it?"
19D,19D_90,A,And it’s not just the quotas. It’s opening it up so every position on a board for ACT Government now has to be advertised.
19D,19D_91,Q,"Advertised, that was the other point, yep, so advertising."
19D,19D_92,A,"So anyone has the opportunity to apply for them, and then you have to - the committee or a board committee or whatever will sit down and go through those applications, and enter them, and who they think that these people sit on their board."
19D,19D_93,Q,So when you say -
19D,19D_94,A,"[Overtalk] 00:26:11 opens it up for - you know, not just sort of the person that you know, you know, “My good mate, Margaret, might like to come and sit on this board.”"
19D,19D_95,Q,"Yeah, exactly. So it’s breaking through what you were talking about early with that network."
19D,19D_96,A,Exactly.
19D,19D_97,Q,"Yeah, it’s really forcing that. With advertising though, is it using social media as well which is likely to capture younger people? Or is it really the traditional newspaper sort of thing?"
19D,19D_98,A,"Look, I was just - so the ACT Government advertises on their website. Now I know they did some of that recently through The Australia Institute [unclear] 00:26:53. I don’t know if they used Facebook. But I’ve never looked either."
19D,19D_99,Q,"Yeah, I’ll look. I’ll have a look."
1D,1D_1,The participant,[audio begins abruptly] – get apologies over and done with. I do apologise. That’s completely my fault and I just completely misaligned my – can you just hold on for a tick?
1D,1D_10,Paul,I can’t see Margo. I can see [inaudible] 00:00:38
1D,1D_100,The participant,"Yeah, it does come down to the chair competence. So one of the skills in being a chair is letting people talk but not too much. Because as I mentioned, once you’re on a board you love talking. So the thing that I try and tell myself most of all is The participant, it’s time for you to shut up now. I’m constantly trying to tell myself that. And a good chair will kind of manage that in way that that is diplomatic, but also move the whole meeting on. So they will notice if someone’s not talking. They will notice if someone should be talking and they’re not talking."
1D,1D_101,The participant,"Or even things like – so the chair for  not for profit organisation will say things like, I can see that you look a bit concerned. Is there anything you’d like to add at this point in time? So it does come down to that, picking up lots of different – and not being favourites. So you will have different – in the boards I’ve been on, you’ll have your chair which is hopefully the natural leader. But typicallythey’re not the most successful person. Or they’re not the richest or they’re not the CEO of some company. That’ll be another person who’s come into the board, just wants to be there for two hours, and so there will be another one or two natural leaders in the board that are probably, if they chose to, could be the alpha person. So the chair has to manage that and make sure that other people around -"
1D,1D_102,Margo,"So they’re all, like the soft issues. What about, are there any procedures or -"
1D,1D_103,The participant,"Well, we do board evaluations at the end of each board. And one of those questions is – and I could get that for you, if you wish."
1D,1D_104,Margo,"Yeah. That would be very useful, yeah."
1D,1D_105,The participant,"There’s a decision making framework that we use that’s aligned to the organisation. So one of the questions is, have you used this decision making framework? Was time managed well? Were there any issues that you felt – so anyway, there’s a whole series of questions. And we have a two minute reflection at the end to say, okay -"
1D,1D_106,Margo,Where do we sit here?
1D,1D_107,The participant,"Yeah. And the other thing that we’ve done quite a bit of is – so in February we’ve got a two day strategy day where we go away and we’ve done training with the [AICD]. 00:37:45 So it’s always good to get other people saying, well this is how a good board will work. And you have outside people coming in and there’s a big profession of trainers that are happy to do that."
1D,1D_108,Margo,"Good. And there’s no financial barrier to people on the board who might be from a lower socioeconomic background, skilling up?"
1D,1D_109,The participant,I’m just trying to think whether I’ve seen that.
1D,1D_11,The participant,All right. Let me just -
1D,1D_110,Margo,Does the board pay or -
1D,1D_111,The participant,"No, the both boards would pay that. Yeah, look that’s a good point. I haven't seen poor people on a board actually."
1D,1D_112,Margo,Really? Even with the NFP organisation ?
1D,1D_113,The participant,"Yeah, I don’t think – well, maybe I have but they’re never – yeah, I haven’t seen people where training would have been an issue, but the board do pay. So you might be right. There is a diversity issue with regard to – yeah. The other diversity which is very interesting, and I pick it up, especially because I’ve been – got involved in politics in the last 18 months. So a lot of people, for example, in  not for profit organisation would be Labour. And I don’t know why that is. Or maybe – yeah, so there will be a constellation of people and, yeah, the Liberals are very quiet if they’re on the board. And the Labour people – yeah, so I’m not -"
1D,1D_114,Margo,So values diversity might be -
1D,1D_115,The participant,"Yeah, or political diversity. Yeah, so for example, we’re trying to get [A particular person] to be chair of the board next year. By the way, all this stuff is really confidential."
1D,1D_116,Margo,"Yeah, we won’t write names."
1D,1D_117,The participant,"Yeah, and that’s very useful for this government. And almost certainly the Labour government federally will happen in May. But yeah, whether it’s a long-term thing is another interesting thing. And it’s not that there’s a bias against it. It’s just I don’t know why – and whether you – yeah."
1D,1D_118,Paul,"So, The participant – I think when talking about the social diversity, the socioeconomic background, there could be a case for a student to be on the SuniTAFE board or [a recent student]. 00:40:22 Or someone with a need for the services of  not for profit organisation or whatever [we are the board of that’s what Margo was getting at] 00:40:29And there’s another aspect as well, which is to say sure, technically people will sit on boards because of educational needs, curricular outcomes that are required to get effectively [on inaudible boards] 00:40:50 are going to be similar. However, they could still have different origins or backgrounds. So I think, if I recall right, you’re an ex-private school boy or whatever [inaudible] 00:41:02"
1D,1D_119,The participant,"Yeah, yeah."
1D,1D_12,Margo,It’s not – yeah.
1D,1D_120,Paul,"For diversity, what you need is someone from the other end of town as well. Of a different background. Because often they could, or they may see things differently or not."
1D,1D_121,The participant,"I agree. I think the case for that would be – I don’t know how you would even do that, to be honest. How you would – yeah, because you don’t typically pick board members based on where they grew up in primary school and how poor or rick their parents were. Yeah, I think that would be interesting. I think those stories do emerge, but it’s all anecdotal and it’s not a selection criteria. So we recently got two new directors for a NFP. And we realised that the women – we wanted more women on there.  not for profit organisationis a – we just had just fallen a little bit – it wasn’t because we were at 50% but it just felt that we needed more women around the table. So the two board members we did go to the [AICD] and say we want two female ones with these set of skills. Yeah, Paul, I think you’ve raised an interesting point with regards to diversity and I don’t know how to answer that question."
1D,1D_122,Paul,"[inaudible] 00:42:33 it’s only pushing that or [I believe] 00:42:38 that or whatever is just that again in some of the [literature] 00:42:42 and sometimes the newspapers they would talk about oh, all sort of blue-blooded, Anglo, older males or whatever [inaudible component] 00:42:52 And I’m not necessarily agreeing with that or not. I was just throwing it out there."
1D,1D_123,The participant,"Yeah, no I think it’s a really interesting point. I suppose I’ll just add my little story to that, is my wife’s a physician. A doctor. And so I have lots of doctor friends. And if I had to pick the most extraordinary doctor friend that I have, it would be an ophthalmologist who was in a small country town, who just did it all herself. She was just – she had to overcome more to get where she was. And then you have the women that went to PLC that had tutors and all that sort of stuff. And they’re not as – they’re extraordinary, but they’re not as extraordinary as this. So if you can get someone like this woman’s name – [Sue] – 00:43:43 if you can get someone like her, who’s just had to travel all that much more, it’s a great get for a board. Because they kind of get it."
1D,1D_124,The participant,"And I remember interviewing a Somalian guy for ANZ who had been a torture victim and he’d had to learn English while on the boat. And you just think, my god, what a journey that person has had to have done. What extraordinary depth that person would bring, especially at a not for profit. I just don’t know how you get – I don’t know even how you’d get selection criteria for that. You’d have to – you see it when you see it, but you can’t sort of market for that, I don’t think."
1D,1D_125,Margo,"Well, see, that’s really interesting. Because that’s where we’re heading, to the selection process."
1D,1D_126,Paul,[inaudible] 00:44:39
1D,1D_127,Margo,How do you?
1D,1D_128,The participant,"Yeah, so I think the selection for gender is easy. It’s almost the easy way that you appear to get diversity because we do – the board will kind of decide – so for example, I’m in the Labour Party, and we were just voting for the executive. And they said oh, I think we feel like we need some more women on the executive. And that what we collectively – it’s acknowledged that you kind of want that balance. Like a family structures is usually balanced – you just naturally feel that – and then if gender isn’t an issue, if you’ve broadly got it balanced, then you just cast the selection out just generally. But I think we’ve got well-established processes for bringing women on boards now. I know a number of women that that’s what they do. And yeah, they know that there are advertisements specifically targeted to them. So I think that kind of diversity, in the boards that I’m dealing with, is pretty easy to get."
1D,1D_129,The participant,"Yeah, at the big end of town, I don’t know about. I think that’s another level of competency that – so yeah, but you do go to the [AICD]. You do go to the Financial Review. These are all selection criteria. I mean, to be even on the [AICD] website you need to have done the $10,000 course. So that’s a little bit of a financial barrier. The way I got the TAFE one, was I was in the Financial Review. Had friends in government. Said look, you have the skills. I knew which TAFE to go for because I knew which TAFE was – so for example, Holmesglen had a managing partners of an accounting firm on there. They didn’t need another accounting governance person. They already had – they had the big name. And I wasn’t going to compete in that. So I knew which TAFEs needed the governance."
1D,1D_13,The participant,"Because it’s coming through the computer, so the computer – sorry. We’ll be -"
1D,1D_130,The participant,"So you get on these things by networks and you only get access to the networks once you engage. So there’s a lot of good people, I imagine, that wouldn’t – like this Somali guy, he wouldn’t have access to those networks or even [Sue], the ophthalmologist, who’s had to – yeah."
1D,1D_131,Margo,So do you as a board member influence the selection? Or the candidates?
1D,1D_132,The participant,"So typically what happens is you get a subcommittee. So you’ll have – it’ll be a renumeration committee and there’ll be one or two people that will interview. And obviously that’ll be the chair. The chair will issue out the skills matrix. They’ll also have a discussion about gender. And they’ll talk about sort of strategy and alignment with that. And where do we see – what skills do we need. So for example,  not for profit organisation has two skyscrapers in the CBD. And we haven't got any property person on the board. So it’s a screaming need. And we’re going to – you can see the cranes around the city. I think we’re coming to a commercial property recession in the next three years. I just think that it’s just – it’s a boom now. There’ll be a little bit of a bust. And the experts thing it’s 2022. We need a property person."
1D,1D_133,The participant,"And the other thing, if you’ve got any skills fundraising or bringing money into an organisation, or selling skills or even government contacts, then those skills are very valuable. And it’s not – you can almost ignore the gender thing if you’ve got those skills."
1D,1D_134,Margo,And do people outside the board influence your selection?
1D,1D_135,The participant,"Well, certainly the CEO would. And there will be key – so for example, I’ve been looking for a finance committee member. And I rang up the chair and said look, do you mind if I just send an email to the CEO seeing if they’re – because typically CEOs are extraordinarily connected. They get to that job because – so yes. And if a CEO is doing a good job, the board members will want to confer with him or her and just say, look I need some help with this. And there’ll be these side relationships – cleared with the chair of course."
1D,1D_136,The participant,"So actually one of the things for the executive training that we ran just before Christmas, I used my CEO contacts to get government – they’re very well connected so yes, the CEO will definitely connect in. And there’ll be one or two members that you’ll connect in as well that will emerge, but I don’t know."
1D,1D_137,Margo,"Yeah, it depends."
1D,1D_138,The participant,"Depends, yeah."
1D,1D_139,Margo,Okay. So you’ve already mentioned this a fair bit. Cognitive diversity. What do you understand by cognitive diversity on the board?
1D,1D_14,Paul,Yeah. The camera is on their computer.
1D,1D_140,The participant,"Yeah, no I think that’s really important. And I think Paul might be in this bucket as well. I can’t go into an organisation or a restaurant or really any entity without doing a little P&L in my head. It’s just – as I walk in, I’ll think oh, okay, this place is earning about $10,000 a week. And it’s just a natural thing for me to do. As I say I -"
1D,1D_141,Paul,[inaudible] 00:50:35
1D,1D_142,The participant,Yeah. And it’s just a product of -
1D,1D_143,Paul,What’s the business model? [inaudible] 00:50:41
1D,1D_144,The participant,Yeah.
1D,1D_145,Paul,And [inaudible] 00:50:42
1D,1D_146,The participant,"No, I agree. And also I mean – and you do notice dentists will look at people’s teeth. They just will. And my wife will notice sick people. And I can see that that bias is – so things that will ruin an organisation – it may well be – so things that will ruin NFP organisation , for example, will not be the financials. We’re sitting on this big wad of cash. Even though that’s where my questions tend to go. The thing that will ruin it will be things like the Royal Commission into Child Abuse. Any relationships with government. If we chose a bad CEO that wanted to move things in a wrong way. Those things are outside my expertise, and they’re outside my ability to ask good questions on. The things that will make it prosper will include things like interrelating it with a fundraising campaign that engages the public. So that’s marketing – I did an MBA specialising in marketing and the one thing I learnt in that is that marketing is not stupid. As an accountant you just think of marketing as a cost centre. And it’s not that.So I’m neutral on marketing now. But you want someone who understands it, believe it, will push it forward and will hustle. So they’re the things that will make it thrive. And none of those things I bring any special skills to the table. Some of them are developing slowly, but like the government thing I’ve started to get a little bit more intent on, but anyway the point is that the things – they’re really important things. And I have noticed – especially government boards, they can devote so much time on governance and compliance and ticking boxes that you can’t make things thrive."
1D,1D_147,The participant,"So I mean, if you choose a CEO that is great, it’s like a school. I was on a board – I’ve been on two boards of schools. If you choose a principal that’s great, you’re three quarters of the way there. And choosing that is really hard. And – yeah."
1D,1D_148,Margo,So you would include the CEO in your understanding of cognitive diversity?
1D,1D_149,The participant,"Yes. Yeah, well the CEO has to have it all really. It’s such a hard – yeah. It’s a hard job."
1D,1D_15,The participant,"All right. So Margo, you might have to come in just that little bit more."
1D,1D_150,Margo,"And do you think that gender, ethnicity, social status, age, is a good predictor of cognitive diversity?"
1D,1D_151,The participant,Yes.
1D,1D_152,Margo,Oh really? Good. Can you -
1D,1D_153,The participant,"Well, I suppose I gave that Indonesian example. I think -"
1D,1D_154,Margo,So ethnicity -
1D,1D_155,The participant,"Yeah. And with the gender, I haven’t – yeah, look, I suppose the female directors have asked more HR questions. And they have asked more holistic questions. So yes, I suppose I do think that. But not strongly. But I’ve seen very empathic men as well. And it might be because women have gone to those fields that are HR and by the time you get to a director you’ve had – wherever you’ve had 20 years experience, is kind of where you -"
1D,1D_156,Margo,Okay. So do you think experience is a stronger predictor?
1D,1D_157,The participant,Yes.
1D,1D_158,Margo,Sorry Paul. Yeah?
1D,1D_159,Paul,"[inaudible] 00:54:38 my Zoom will cut off at 11.30. Can I suggest we keep going – I’ll phone one of you on your mobile. Just put my on speaker. And we’ll keep going and given the time, if I can, I will get another Zoom connection."
1D,1D_16,Margo,Sure.
1D,1D_160,Margo,"Yeah. We’re nearly there. Good. Okay, so does your board consider ways to increase cognitive diversity on its board? When identifying new members."
1D,1D_161,The participant,"Identifying new members? Yes, it does. So in the selection criteria there’ll be a discussion – and it’ll be led by the chair again saying this is what I think the board needs. And it’ll be an open discussion. Yeah, so that’s certainly with the NFP organisation . And it’s certainly the case with the SuniTAFE and the government things. The government is a very – I could get it for you, but the interview structure is very – it’s very good. It’s very comprehensive. So it will – one of the things about government I’ve found is that it’s extremely comprehensive and it does cover these things that you would normally forget. But the other side is that it’s very slow. But the questions that they ask and that they consider, it’s certainly the government certainly goes back to that -"
1D,1D_162,Margo,It would be great to have a copy of that.
1D,1D_163,The participant,Yeah. Let me – I know one of the secretaries. So I can – and I can see the one. You’ll have to email me though to remind me.
1D,1D_164,Margo,I will email you. Yep. On your La Trobe one?
1D,1D_165,The participant,"Yes, go with that. And my Gmail if you would. My Gmail connects all my four jobs together."
1D,1D_166,Margo,"Yep, I’ll get that at the end. Okay, so all things being equal, in a scenario where you’ve only got one board vacancy, would you prefer this vacancy to be filled by a candidate who increases a particular kind of diversity? Like gender, ethnicity, age, social, or cognitive?"
1D,1D_167,The participant,Yeah.
1D,1D_168,Margo,Or does it depend?
1D,1D_169,The participant,"Yeah, it depends on the strategy and the need of the organisation. If you are – yes, sorry, it really does. If you’re planning to go into Asia, get some people – get some native born Asians on your board. If you’re looking to appoint a CEO, you want someone that – yeah, if you can get HR backgrounds, someone who’s employed people, someone who has been a CEO would be great. So that – if your board is a bit compliance-y, then don’t get them. Yeah, so it does. It depends on the strategy."
1D,1D_17,The participant,Okay. Very good. All right.
1D,1D_170,Margo,What about if it’s a merger? Post-merger?
1D,1D_171,The participant,"Well, I’ve done one of those, but -"
1D,1D_172,Margo,Did that have an impact?
1D,1D_173,The participant,"My once experience of that is it’s been very messy. And it kind of just falls out. If you can control the process, then that’d be good. I haven’t seen that in a coherent way. I haven't been close enough to where that’s happened."
1D,1D_174,Margo,And so you’ve answered the next question about the behavioural matrices quite well.
1D,1D_175,The participant,"Yeah, actually I’ve used -"
1D,1D_176,Margo,Do you want to -
1D,1D_177,The participant,"No, I’ve said competency matrices. I haven’t mentioned behavioural matrices."
1D,1D_178,Margo,Great. Skills and behaviours matrices.
1D,1D_179,The participant,Hold on one tick. Sorry about that.
1D,1D_18,Paul,"So we might as well get cracking. Now, Margo will actually be doing all the questions. I might throw in a few here and there. But just [inaudible] 00:01:08 this is part of a pilot study for an RSA funded project on board diversity. And Margo would have sent you an information sheet, essentially it’s all just [inaudible] 00:01:22 things, it’s received ethic clearance, everything you say is confidential. We report things in aggregation, all totally anonymised. And there are stringent requirements in terms of [inaudible] 00:01:41"
1D,1D_180,Margo,That’s okay.
1D,1D_181,The participant,"Yeah, no, I think that’s fantastic but very difficult thing to do. Yeah, so I think you had attitudes or behaviour. I think -"
1D,1D_182,Margo,Skills and behavioural matrices to assess balance.
1D,1D_183,The participant,"Yeah, I think behavioural is – I haven’t seen it done. I don’t know how you could do it. But I’d love to see it. Like conservative. Risk taker. Holistic. Analytical. It would come under discussion, I think. And a good chair would bring that out. They’d go oh, look. I think we’ve got too many bean counters, or we’ve got too many abacus – and we need someone – I think it’s holistic. And I haven't seen a framework for it. It would be very – I think it would be interesting if there was a framework."
1D,1D_184,Margo,"Right, so it’s not in these questions; this questionnaire that you said is so thorough. I thought it might be in that."
1D,1D_185,The participant,For the government?
1D,1D_186,Margo,For the selecting board. Yeah.
1D,1D_187,The participant,"Well, the government one, I do need to – I thought it was thorough. And you do have – I suppose you have behavioural questions. But I haven't seen where a board would go, gee, we’re just in need of a go-getting social person, because we’re just not coherent in that way. I’ve been to training where you’ve got drivers and you’ve got team makers and you’ve got all these things, but yeah, I agree. I think that would be – if we had a framework, the boards that I would be on would be interested in that, I think. All the chairs would be."
1D,1D_188,Margo,That’s good. So now we’re looking at cultivating diversity. These are the final set of questions. Does your board do anything to cultivate new potential members? Like your person from a disadvantaged background? This gentleman you mentioned.
1D,1D_189,The participant,"Yeah, well the cultivating diversity is – so this is appointing new people or is this -"
1D,1D_19,The participant,Sure.
1D,1D_190,Margo,Yeah. New potential members.
1D,1D_191,The participant,"Yeah, the other way that you get board members is just through the networks. So someone will – there’ll be an acknowledged need for something. And people will go out to the network and they’ll say oh, look. I know someone. And I think – I haven’t seen where that’s cultivated in any formal sense. It’s more an informal – and with cultivating I think you’re meaning choosing. So that Somali guy, he wasn’t going for a board member, he was going for a manager position. His name got written down to consider. He didn’t get it, because his communication skills weren’t – they were about a year off being what was required. But he was cultivated and he actually got it the next year. Now I haven’t seen boards – I’ve seen boards maintain relationships, like we’re trying to do with [A particular person]. So we’re courting her at the moment. If she wants a cup of coffee, we’re buying the coffee. Yeah, we’re telling her what a good – yeah, so there’s a lot of people – [A particular person’s] being courted by a number of people at the moment."
1D,1D_192,The participant,"So I suppose we’re trying to cultivate that. I suppose I haven’t seen it in a formal sense. I haven’t seen a framework where you go, oh, we’re lacking this. These are the questions [inaudible] 01:02:22 This is how we cultivate. It’s more the directive of the chair and yeah, I wish I could answer that question better."
1D,1D_193,Margo,"No, that’s okay. But you see there’s a gap possibly?"
1D,1D_194,The participant,"Yes. I think I do. I do like this behavioural matrices. And bringing different viewpoints to a table. And I suppose I’m along the lines of selling performance, holistic strategy, how do you get through the next 10 years when everything is changing. And what’s the best behavioural aspects. So one of the best behavioural aspects of getting through the next 10 years, for example, is to make lots of small bets. You go, I’ll have 10 options, six of those options won’t work, but four will. We’re not in the environment anymore where you have a business model that will last for 20 years. But behaviourally that is a different type of person. That’s not someone who’s been an accountant – that’s not the person who’s been at a law firm for 30 years. That’s someone who’s a little be entrepreneurial for example. Or has tried and failed. And I think they do that in America. I haven't seen it as much in Australia, for example. And boards are a little – I find that the boards are possibly a little bit conservative."
1D,1D_195,Margo,Yeah. Because I was also thinking back to those low socioeconomic groups that you’re services at  not for profit organisation targets. You might be able to think of ways to cultivate a potential member from that community who is -
1D,1D_196,The participant,"Yeah, I think that would be – and especially – so for example, one of the things that homeless people don’t like is they don’t like forming relationships with people – it’s understandable, they don’t like paternalistic relationships. And you get that. And I know this from not personal experience but closely related personal experience. They don’t kind of want their position shoved in their face by having another father or mother figure. They want friends and people that walk – and the people that would understand that best is the people that have walked the path. So I think that would be very good. But you have to have walked the path and then still be competent enough to contribute. You can’t be an angry young man in a board that requires competence and requires you to look at financials. So in a way you need that special breed of person that’s like the Eddie McGuire kind of person or this Somali guy. I don’t know how you find them. I think they’re gems when you do. Like [Sue], the doctor. You grab them when you find them."
1D,1D_197,Paul,"I think – I just want to make sure we kind of record this because the point you’re making is a very good one, The participant. Potentially you could get someone, say the  not for profit organisationcase who tick one box extremely well. Because [inaudible] 01:05:52 empathy and the understanding and all this sort of stuff. But will fall down in other areas and potentially in the behavioural competencies that are required. And there are some framework and stuff around, it’s more the big end of town. But I agree, it is very hard and it usually ultimately people getting interviewed and will [inaudible] 01:06:17 we’ve got so many type As, type B [inaudible] 01:06:19 and I think that’s a [inaudible subjective inaudible] 01:06:13 ultimately it’s not a scientific. But so I think that’s the point you’re getting at, right?"
1D,1D_198,The participant,Yeah.
1D,1D_199,Paul,"They tick that box where they can really add value on saying, oh well, a homeless person is not going to really want that. Sorry. But if they can’t then contribute and work as a cohesive team, work cohesively for the rest of the 90% of the time or whatever, then potentially a dysfunctionality or – is that what you were getting at?"
1D,1D_2,Margo,I think they’re probably there. Get kicked out.
1D,1D_20,Paul,[inaudible] 00:01:44
1D,1D_200,The participant,"Yes. And in fact, I love the way you’ve put that. And you’ve reminded me of something that’s – I think cohesion is really, really important. It’s more important that diversity. You do have to have a – so diversity is important but cohesion is something that you really want. And that’s what the chair has to bring out. And if you had to choose between the two, cohesion is really important. And I use an example of a board member that the chair got rid of, because he was exactly – super competent in some areas. But just wasn’t cohesive. And at the end of the day, it’s a very hard structure to just keep together. It’s like these atoms that they don’t want to fall apart, but you’re just there for four hours every month. You want to get the value you can. You can’t waste time arguing points that – so yeah, cohesion is really important. And a good chair will bring that out and then they’ll bring the benefits of diversity in as well."
1D,1D_201,The participant,"The other point I wanted to make is that you do need – and this is related to Paul’s point. You do want an area of expertise. But you want to be broad as well. So you want everyone to understand that marketing is important. You want everyone to understand that HR is important. You might need – and we go from a scale from one to five. Five is an execute that’s serviced at an elite level in one area. You want that. And then one is you’ve got a working knowledge. You’re not at zero, it’s just you have no understandings. You don’t want anyone at zero on anything.So I think Paul’s point is really good because you want ones. And you would want that – you also want, if you’ve got someone who’s a specialist in Indonesia and understand an Asian way of doing business and has empathy in that way, that won’t do anything unless you can form a coalition of people."
1D,1D_202,The participant,"And the other thing I wanted to say – this is something that I’m very interested in. And it is – I’ve got a theory that in every organisation there’ll be a scapegoat. In every group there’ll be someone in favour and there’ll be someone out of favour. Or at least that’s the natural tendency of humans to just – and so I did notice with the – a chair has to control that impulse. That scapegoating impulse. This board would be good except for that member. Or I suppose that’s that cohesion point. But there are things that push cohesion away. And it’s not diversity. It’s kind of a pack mentality. Because in boards you’ll have, out of 12 people you’ll have two or three coalitions. And then you might have one on the outer. And sometimes people want that person on the outer because their performance is, oh, at least I’m better than that guy. And so that’s a very – so I think it’s natural. In the pecking order, people will know if they’re first or second. And they’ll know if they’re last. And so – yeah, you will know that. Not the two boards that I’m on, but I have been on a board where I’ve just been the least competent person there, and you just go okay, well that’s – so I suppose what I’m trying to say is the cohesion is really, really important. And a chair has to manage that. And that may not be at odds with diversity, and hopefully it isn’t."
1D,1D_203,Margo,"Yeah, no, that’s really good. It feeds into a whole literature on managing difference and conflict within boards. Yeah, it’s great 01:11:08 stuff. That’s good. So more generally, how do you think diversity should be increased in Australian company boards?"
1D,1D_204,The participant,"I suppose this is a summary question, but I mean -"
1D,1D_205,Paul,"[inaudible general] 01:11:24 The participant, this is not about your experience."
1D,1D_206,The participant,"Oh okay, this is just general."
1D,1D_207,Paul,[inaudible] 01:11:30
1D,1D_208,The participant,"Okay, I mean, I think gender is the easy one to say. So that’s – I think that’s just a no-brainer. The one where I think – I do like the behavioural diversity. And I am of the opinion that you have this governance/performance diversity as well. You can have some people that emphasis governance and some people that emphasis performance. I do like the inward and outward diversity, if you like. Where people will be looking out and they’ll go, that’s the big picture. And there’ll be people that are looking in and they’re going for the detail. I think you really need some diversity on – especially Indonesia and New Guinea and all these things. All these things were Australia has been very lucky for 20 something years. But what I’m telling my children is that you’ve got to look out. And I think boards needs to look out as well. Look outside Australia."
1D,1D_209,The participant,"Australia is a spoke and there are hubs out there. And the spokes have to hook into the hubs. So one of the hubs is Indonesia and Singapore. Another hub is Japan and China. Another hub is America. These hubs are going to be directing the way things are done. And you can’t have 12 people from Melbourne who have travelled to these places for one week. You need some hook-in. I wouldn’t call it diversity, you just need people with those experiences there. One of the best things, for example, that ANZ did was bring in people from Google that has been in America. Because all of a sudden they have that Silicon Valley diversity that is really needed in today’s companies. So that’s a lot of diversity there. And I do really like, I think, both of your points. And if you can get someone who has done the hard yards – because they’re the skills that you kind of need. Those entrepreneurial, resilience, networking, all those skills. The skills that you need for the next 10 years are going to be much more hustling sort of skills. And if you can get someone who’s gone from the bottom to the top, as I said, if you can get them, you get them."
1D,1D_21,The participant,"Thank you, Paul."
1D,1D_210,Margo,"That would be amazing. Yep. Okay, so selection and networking and looking outward in order to do these effectively – it is a strategy."
1D,1D_211,The participant,"And it would be good – one of the things I really like, I got given by the [AICD] and also – is a series of questions, good questions to ask. And they’re just things that you go, oh, yeah, that’s an interesting thing to ask. And I like the idea of having things like behavioural matrices where you have – actually we’re going to add – there’s a book of questions. I’m sure there’s lots of books but I’ve got a book at home, is questions that good directors should ask. And I might flick through it to see if there are those behavioural and those kind of – those broader diversity questions in there. Because I mean, you want to ask, are you – you don’t want to say, should I think differently? That’s not a question – you want to be able to say, have you thought of this? Because then that makes – the first question is much too general to be useful. You want the intelligence to be able to ask the really fine-tuned questions."
1D,1D_212,Margo,So a bank of questions might be a useful outcome for selection?
1D,1D_213,The participant,"Yeah. It would be interesting to – I mean, that’s just an old book, but I’ve got a book. And it would be interesting to see if all these questions are in there. And then if they are in there, are they being used? Yeah, a bank of questions would be a good deliverable I think."
1D,1D_214,Margo,What barriers are there to increasing diversity in Australian company boards do you think?
1D,1D_215,The participant,"I think diversity breeds diversity. And I think you’ve got to get to the chairs. The chairs really run the roost I think. Yeah, if you get to the chairs then you’re kind of – and I do believe that women are more open-minded in employing women. That’s just –yeah."
1D,1D_216,Margo,And men in employing men?
1D,1D_217,The participant,"Yeah, maybe. I think you are imprisoned by your experiences. Not imprisoned, but you’re influenced by them and I think that’s – so if you’re experience is as a women, you do get – that’s a set of experiences you bring to the table. And your future will represent your past to some degree."
1D,1D_218,Margo,"Do you think that’s a comfort thing? A psychological, sociological – or do think it’s like a network sociological?"
1D,1D_219,The participant,"Oh, I think it’s a survival mechanism in some ways. So the way I got onto  not for profit organisation was a friend introduced me. And I’m not going to let that friend down. The network – there’ll be social consequences. And also that friend I’ve been friends with since I was 15. And so I’ve known her for a long time. So she knows that I’m not outrageous. I haven’t had 10 years of my life on an Ashram. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. But she knows the last 30 years. She doesn’t know just two references. So the network and networking skills are really important."
1D,1D_22,Margo,"Good. Great. Well, thank you, The participant."
1D,1D_220,Margo,And there’s a female choosing a male.
1D,1D_221,The participant,"Yeah, yeah. No, no, as I said, right now all my bosses are women. All five of them."
1D,1D_222,Margo,"Now, you’re a non-state sector board? You don’t have state sector boards do you?"
1D,1D_223,The participant,"Well, the  not for profit organisationboard – no, the SuniTAFE is -"
1D,1D_224,Margo,"Oh, so you’ve got both."
1D,1D_225,The participant,"Yeah, so that’s a state. I mean, state you mean government?"
1D,1D_226,Margo,"Yeah, non-profit and for profit I guess."
1D,1D_227,The participant,"No, there’s not – I’m not on a profit one."
1D,1D_228,Margo,So do you favour the introduction of gender quotas? And what are the pros and cons do you reckon?
1D,1D_229,The participant,"Yes I do. But I wouldn’t want it to be 50%, the quota. I’d want it to be something – some minimum threshold. Because you might want – NFP organisation , because of its history, you might want more women. I don’t know, if it’s the AFL, you might want – just because it’s servicing – it would depend. The Labour Party has it, and I think that’s worked. I would like to see the day where they’re off. So I’ve got three sons. They’re 17, 15, and 11. By the time they’re ready for board positions, I would like to see – I mean quotas will hopefully be a thing of the past. The women that I know are competent enough to compete on an even footing. They’re just as good networkers. They’re just – so I would like to see the day where they’re not needed. But I think the other diversity is quite interesting. So the state ones have – like if you can get an Aboriginal person on there, it’s – like if you can get a Noel Pearson, I mean he could be on 20 boards. He’s just so competent and yeah, I think gender quotas, they’re kind of any easy way. I’m hoping that that battle is half won. The other diversity is probably interesting to think about."
1D,1D_23,The participant,Very good. We made it.
1D,1D_230,Margo,It’s more interesting types of diversity.
1D,1D_231,Paul,"[inaudible] 01:20:23 quickly, The participant. With quotas I guess on two fronts. And firstly I’d be interested in a comment from you, if I say that most of the women in my personal life – I’m speaking of my ex-wife in particular, but one or two other people – kind of, if there’s anything that pisses them off is the quota concept because she’s achieved a hell of a lot without that. And just resent even the question around I've seen in a TV interview or whatever, so what is it like to be IT leader as a woman or whatever, do you know what I mean? [Gendering]. 01:21:12 I’d like a comment on that but I’d also like it reconciled where, you know, you started off talking about the importance of the competencies and obviously diversity around competencies. And the perception that even extremely competent women who end up on boards may be perceived by many as oh, they’re only there because they had a to fill a 50% quota, if you know what I mean? So whatever it is, 20% or whatever."
1D,1D_232,The participant,"Yeah, thank you. I really like your point. I don’t like the idea of quotas. And I would like them not to be there. I suppose my answer is driven by the fact that there’s been a lot of talk for a long time and the talk hasn’t worked. And I’m more thinking broader – so it has worked for the Labour Party where I’m not on the executive, I’m in there. And they do have women that have filtered through to the ministership and the deputy prime minister and so I’m just trying to think. It’s like cutting out a cancer or something. I don’t like it. I agree, I don’t want to live in a world where quotas are necessary. I don’t want the quota to be 50%. I just think they work. And I’d like it – yeah, I don’t want to live in a world with them. I think everyone – if there’s enough competent women out there who deserve to be there without quotas. And I think that’s – but yeah."
1D,1D_233,Paul,"[inaudible] 01:23:05 Yeah, there’s a trade-off and on balance you prefer – because it works and it gets the job done in some ways, you’re happy to wear some of the other negatives."
1D,1D_234,The participant,The cost. Yes.
1D,1D_235,Paul,[inaudible] 01:23:21
1D,1D_236,The participant,"I acknowledge there’s a cost. There’s definitely a cost. And there’s a cost on both sides, I think. Because in a perfectly random world, you may well have a board with all men and that would be fine. And you might have a board of all women, and it would be – actually no, it wouldn’t be fine. You want the balance. But a random distribution would be fine if you had two thirds male or – but you’re just not getting that randomness. And I would like it solved by the time my sons – it’s a little bit like – what I think, I’ve got a number of South African friends and it’s a bit like South Africa where the reason there’s so many white South Africans here, is because their sons aren’t being treated fairly because of the rebalancing. But you just want – but the rebalancing probably has to happen. You just hope it doesn’t have to happen for very long."
1D,1D_237,Margo,Affirmative action?
1D,1D_238,The participant,"Well, yeah."
1D,1D_239,Margo,"Okay, so our final is just, do you have any other thoughts to share on board diversity? And on how this diversity should be managed?"
1D,1D_24,Margo,"We made it. Exactly. So let’s get right into it, and we’ll try and keep it under an hour. But I think it might be -"
1D,1D_240,The participant,"Yeah, I really like your bank of questions. And as I said, the noses in – you are limited as – in a way, boards are very imperfect functions. You just don’t have enough knowledge, you don’t have enough day to day knowledge. I find it’s quite hard to add value. They’re cumbersome. They’re expensive. But they’re very useful for doing some very key things. So any help you can give a board, it’s very helpful. It’s very useful because – so it’s a kind of a very contrived structure in a way. Useful but forced together. And a bank of questions, questions that you go actually have you thought of this, would be a good thing to do. And especially those bank of questions that include things like behavioural, include things like strategy and alignment with – and also skills that are going into the next 10-15 years. Which I think would be -"
1D,1D_241,Margo,Future-looking not just outward-looking?
1D,1D_242,The participant,Yeah.
1D,1D_243,Paul,"So The participant, you sort – just for our help, because you’re an internal and this is part [of inaudible so inaudible formal interview kind of over] 01:26:03 Can I ask you a question, because this is something – Margo and I are going to do a debrief. You’re our first interview [inaudible] 01:26:13 I’d like to ask you a question. Very early on, when we talked about diversity, pretty much the first question, you immediately jumped on what was very logical, particularly  for someone in a medium-sized smaller board where you just [immediately jumped onto] 01:26:35 cognitive competency and diversity as opposed to gender et cetera. Now there’s [some studies very valuable] 01:26:44 for us to the extent that every [party inaudible] 01:26:46 a significant number say look, when you guys mentioned diversity, the first thing I think of is this sort of competency/cognitive diversity, not the other stuff, is important information for us. Right? That’s very important. Having said that, a lot of our questions and the research questions and the [bulk] 01:27:07 of the study is about the other type of diversity. So do you feel it off-putting or anything when I sort of steered you back to, if you like, the focus of the study, which was around gender, ethnicity, that sort of diversity?"
1D,1D_244,The participant,"No, no."
1D,1D_245,Paul,"Because [there was inaudible early] 01:27:34 I was a bit concerned that it was a very – it would have been a very interesting study to talk about the cognitive diversity and a whole range of questions around that, but the purpose of this study was to focus on the sort of diversity that we were looking at, which is around gender and ethnicity et cetera. Although your initial [inaudible] 01:27:58 is very valuable. So if the vast majority of people say that, that send a message as well. And that’s an important kind of finding and something that we want to analyse and report."
1D,1D_246,The participant,"Yeah, I really like your point. And I suppose the predictor of your future and your competency is a function of the past. And you’re trying to capture competency by having sort of some diversity in there. so in a way I think that you can bridge the two. I suppose you and I are very much analytical business model people. And we’re probably both interested in competencies and expertise and behavioural fit and cohesion. But that sort of stuff comes through – the way you pick it is going, well have you had the necessary experiences? Have you had – and those experiences might be gender-related experiences or work-related experiences. Or ethnicity. So yeah, you don’t get those competencies unless you’ve actually had that diversity. So I suppose I was going to the end game. Whereas I suppose you were more driving toward the legs of the table. And I was happy with both."
1D,1D_247,Margo,"Yeah, so you were comfortable with that? That’s good."
1D,1D_248,Paul,[That is good inaudible] 01:29:33
1D,1D_249,Margo,"Oh, well this is too long. We went too long. I’m so sorry."
1D,1D_25,The participant,"No, no. That’s fine. That’s all good."
1D,1D_250,The participant,"No, no. Don’t be silly."
1D,1D_251,Margo,"I think we’ll probably need to – I’ll work on a [sub-state] 01:29:55 of this, Paul. We’ll talk about it. I think we need to limit it."
1D,1D_252,Paul,[inaudible] 01:30:00 think we should necessarily make any changes until we finish the pilot.
1D,1D_253,Margo,Okay. Do the pilot first. Okay.
1D,1D_254,The participant,"So let me know – I’ve haven't got contacts at the way big end of town. I’ve got – so for example, when we had the executive training, I was able to talk to the speaker – things like CEOs of [AMES] 01:30:24 I’ve got contacts – as Paul has as well, but if you have any wishlist. If you have a wishlist of four people, I could probably get one or two of them. And Paul would probably get the other two."
1D,1D_255,Paul,"[inaudible] 01:30:37 one of the reasons we put that request on ice is we’ll finish the pilot and then we’ve got to think hard about – we’ll never get the wishlist but what’s our wishlist in terms of a [sample] 01:30:53 and then try sampling form there and then I’ll basically say, right, I could probably pick up these seven, eight types of people. A few others. And then we will come to you to try and help fill in those gaps et cetera. We will definitely come to you. Because it’s going to be a hard ask to get the – we’re aiming for 35-40 people. [inaudible] 01:31:20 we will definitely come to you on that."
1D,1D_256,The participant,"Yeah. And the bigger end of the town, the bigger you get the more you’re going to have to push it back to an hour. Just -"
1D,1D_257,Margo,Yeah. I think we can get this back to an hour. Yeah.
1D,1D_258,Paul,[inaudible] 01:31:35 that’s why – we could do that. Yeah.
1D,1D_259,The participant,That’s just a – yeah.
1D,1D_26,Margo,"Okay, so I’m going to just do a general interview and then it goes through five phases. So the first is, you look at the costs and benefits of diversity. Board diversity. Then we’ll look at processes related to managing diversity on the board. Selection process. How to cultivate diversity. And then some room for final comments with you. So that’s what we’re going to move through. So The participant, there’s a lot of talk about board diversity, but we’re interested to hear from you because you sit on an Australian board, and so we’re interested in that perspective. So let’s start by hearing about what board diversity means to you?"
1D,1D_260,Margo,"Okay, so did you mind the questions?"
1D,1D_261,The participant,"No, no. The questions were good. And especially the last half of the questions, they were – they’re probably thinking, I really like -"
1D,1D_262,Margo,So the cultivating or -
1D,1D_263,The participant,"Well, the behaviour one, I’m really – I’m quite interested -"
1D,1D_264,Margo,"Okay, so that’s the selection criteria -"
1D,1D_265,The participant,"Yeah, I’m quite interested in frameworks with that."
1D,1D_266,Margo,I’ll do some more research on that. Research frameworks for behaviour.
1D,1D_267,Paul,"Well, essentially, The participant, on the [AICD] course recently, or in the last year anyway – and [well I think that inaudible] 01:32:20 for matrices that have the competency and then they’ve put behavioural as well. But they don’t necessarily identify behaviour [or trace] 01:32:30 it could vary from organisation to organisation. And I really think – what I’ve heard from the big end of town where they’ve looked at that, it is more about fit. It is also more about having [inaudible] 01:32:45 to say look, I’ve got an executive. I’ve got this many type As. It’s actually good to have a couple of type Bs broadly speaking or [what else. So inaudible like that] 01:32:55 you know, the listening skills, et cetera. And it tends to get teased out – it’s not very scientific. I mean, if you did behavioural testing, and you could find a method that everyone agrees on. I mean, they’re all full of holes. My daughter was like, oh, [my inaudible] 01:33:18 there’s no actual evidence behind it. Even though we all [inaudible do that] 01:33:25 that’s difficult to implement in a board – a board-type setting. Unless it becomes and absolutely, this is what we do and everyone does it kind of thing. And so it really – at the moment to the extent that it happens, it is very much the chair and somebody else is [inaudible] 01:33:44 coming to do and interview and they’re trying to make that kind of assessment."
1D,1D_268,The participant,"Yeah, I agree. And one of the committees I was on failed because it had too many team players on it, and not enough – and the only person that wasn’t a team player that was a driver was the chair. So everyone else was trying to get along and the only person that was wanting to drive the organisation forward, irrespective of team cohesion, was the very, very boss person. And so ideally you would want a couple of drivers sitting in there. But how do you have that conversation? How do you go – how do you even start the conversation. Some of you are not ambitious enough and we need to get rid of two of you. I don’t even know how you move from where it was to where it needed to be."
1D,1D_269,Paul,"[inaudible] 01:34:40 it’s a bigger issue for example in a university setting where – so typically in [admin circles] 01:34:48 but not necessarily just in [admin circles] there wouldn’t – and you see this in some of the cultural values they’re putting out et cetera, which I’ve got no problem with by the way, as a general thing. They want – a good [vision] 01:35:02 is where everyone agrees and there’s consensus. And [that’s a load of bollocks.] 01:35:07"
1D,1D_27,The participant,"All right. And I might do it through a prism of a recent experience. And so obviously this confidential. So I sit on two boards and a number of audit committees. I’m the chair of the finance committee for  not for profit organisationas well. So I’m on a number of mid-sized – so I don’t have that – I’ve reported to boards that are bit, but I’m sitting on two mid-sized boards. One the SuniTAFE in Mildura. And one with NFP organisation . And the  not for profit organisationhas a number of areas, but it has, apart from anything else, it has $200 millions dollars of funds that it sits on. Due to some very canny real estate investments 200 years ago."
1D,1D_270,The participant,It is.
1D,1D_271,Paul,"I mean, [inaudible you do need inaudible] 01:35:09 you do need challenge, and sometimes the outcome that only 20% of the group in the meeting prefer maybe the better outcome for the organisation. But also and particular in [admin circles] but to some degree in academia broadly, those people are then seen as oh, the negative people. And they don’t get along. And they’re not team players et cetera. They’re seen very negatively. I’ve actually seen it with a senior admin person I’ve worked closely with who I value hugely. That person is being penalised elsewhere or not getting certain things because the person is being [inaudible] 01:35:56 just saying hang on, respectfully but nevertheless they say look, hang on. I disagree. Surely you’d have this problem. You should be doing this instead or whatever. So that’s an issue as well. I mean, General Patton I think summed it up very well. He said, if all of you are in agreement, someone’s not doing his job."
1D,1D_272,The participant,"Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I have an experience. The best boss I ever had was a fighter. And she put everyone offside. And she was called up to the CFO – this is [Peter Marriott] 01:36:32 if you know that name. And [Peter Marriott] called her up and said, I need you to keep doing exactly what you’re doing. Because otherwise -"
1D,1D_273,Margo,The disruption is good.
1D,1D_274,The participant,"Well, yeah. I’ve got too many team players and right now, status quo is completely not what’s needed. And yeah, so your point is really well made. You need different types and you can fail if you don’t have that kind of thing in there. But very good. All right, look, thank you. It’s very – and I do apologise that I’ve got no – [audio ends abruptly]"
1D,1D_28,The participant,"So, look, diversity is really important. And one of the reasons it’s really important, one of the things that happened recently is we had to sack a CEO. And CEOs tread this very fine line between risking enough to get a business going – because they have to be go-getters, and they have to be a type of person that is a go-getter – and to be a conservative person that keeps everything together. And sometimes I’ve seen that that mix doesn’t work. And you do need a board to oversee that. And you do need – when you’re kind of assessing whether a CEO is balancing on that line, whether he’s doing enough risk and he’s doing enough keeping the whole thing together – so you can have problems either way. You can have a CEO that’s not trying hard enough and not risking enough. Or you can have a CEO that’s actually gone a little bit crazy."
1D,1D_29,The participant,"And to assess that, you kind of need a trial by jury, in a way. If that makes sense. Because it’s a very hard decision to make. Whether they’re making enough bets or whether they’re making the right bets. And obviously the boards main job is to appoint a CEO and make sure that their performance is keeping to track. And then the rest is monitoring and governance, but that’s the really hard job. And I suppose if you’re going to – it’s not trial by jury, but it almost is. If you’re going to have that, you do need more than just one type of person to do that. You need someone that’s – so in the NFP organisation , which is mostly about resources and giving programs to disadvantaged women and girls, you need people that are good on that front, on the social front. You need people that are good on law, especially law. You need people good on accounting. You need people who are really hooked into government, because government funding is crucial."
1D,1D_3,The participant,Yeah. Sure.
1D,1D_30,The participant,"So you need that diversity of skills and you need the diversity of attitudes and ability to judge whether someone’s doing an okay job. Because apart from anything else, CEOS almost are always very clever. And they're very, very good at marketing, especially self-marketing. So yeah, I suppose I see it in that way. It’s not a trial by jury, but kind of like that."
1D,1D_31,Margo,"Okay, so you’ve mentioned that board diversity is like the capacities of the different people. So a functional diversity with different people on the board. But also their relationships, like networks to government. But then you’ve also brought in that third kind of diversity, which seems to be like the relationship between the board and the management. And that you have to be able to be flexible to manage – like board by jury, which is quite independent. And then is there another way that the board can relate to management? The chief executive?"
1D,1D_32,The participant,"Well, I mean, it has to go through. You have to be very – I mean, the [tricker] 00:06:31 model I think, because that’s the one that says you go through the CEO, doesn’t it?"
1D,1D_33,Margo,Yeah.
1D,1D_34,The participant,"Yeah, that seems to be the one that is workable that I’ve seen. I do have a relationship with the CFO – with the two CFOs, just because I’m finance-based. But there’s kind of an approval process that I’ve seen that you go through the chair, and the CEO, and you say look, just functionally I need to do this. If it’s anything important I will cc – I will courtesy copy both of you. It’s by appointment. It’s by exception. So you do have that relationship with management. But a lot of it does filter through the CEO. And I mean, it’s a hard job, because CEOs have to manage – there’s 12 people on both boards. It’s such a hard job to do. And you don’t want loose ends. As much as possible, you want to give them the capability of managing you to the extent possible. So you do – yeah, I mean, that’s why everything goes through the chair. And the chair’s job does seem to be five times harder than being on a board. And I think a chair’s job, you need 10 years of experience on a board to be a good chair, in my opinion. I wouldn’t be experienced enough, for example. Yeah, so the diversity mixes in, in that framework if that makes sense."
1D,1D_35,Paul,"Yeah, [inaudible] 00:07:57 so do a large degree what you’re describing, to a large degree is more functional line, so say for like the Australian Institute of Company Directors recommend that a lot of boards create their own skills matrices for example. Where [inaudible] 00:08:14 organisation, some people within the social world, some people who are the legal, financial – sometimes a combination, et cetera, et cetera. And the debate that’s going on with diversity at the moment – and we accept that. I mean, that’s understood. That’s obviously important – is also around other attributes such as gender, ethnicity, possibly age. But particularly gender and ethnicity. And gender I think is what gets most of the spotlight. Is that sort of diversity important, do you think?"
1D,1D_36,The participant,"Yeah, look, just by way of background – and obviously – so my two chairs are women. My bosses at La Trobe are women. My boss here is a woman. My wife is an extremely competent woman. I accept that there’s a controversy around it, but for me that controversy has – it’s almost – it’s not irrelevant, because I just think you do want women there. And yeah – just you want them there, as just a part of a natural process I think. It’s not – I haven’t been a part of a process where they’ve pushed for women to be on there, because the boards that I’m on are half and half. And it’s just a natural -"
1D,1D_37,Margo,Hasn’t been an issue?
1D,1D_38,The participant,"It hasn’t been an issue. So I know that you say there’s controversy, and the big end of town is probably there – and I haven’t got experience in that, but the not for profit space and the places that I play, it is – and I’ve had a number of chairs on both of them. And I really can’t see – the woman chair at the moment for  not for profit organisation– before that there was two main chairs. She’s the best one we’ve had. And maybe it’s attributable to gender, but maybe it’s attributable to the fact that she was the chair of Brotherhood of St Laurence, she’s just very competent in that social space. So I do look at it through the prism of competency rather than – and I also look at it through emotional lenses. So there will be very specific people that are empathic. There will be very specific people that are detailed and analytical. And I think you want that. So I’m not answering the question, I think, the way you want it answered, Paul. But I do see it as an non-issue where I’m at. And so I don’t know whether that’s politically correct or anything."
1D,1D_39,Paul,"[inaudible] 00:11:18 That’s fine. But just to say, a lot of the questions that Margo will be going through moving forward – I mean, not necessarily buying into a debate on one side or the other or whatever. We’re just trying to [understand] 00:11:34 some of the issues here. When we talk about diversity and diversity in terms of their competence is assumed as important, but we’re also thinking in terms of gender diversity. Because your boards are [clearly pretty diverse] 00:11:53 which is fine. Other boards aren’t. Some are extremely – you know. [inaudible] 00:12:00 But also not just gender. It’s things like ethnic [inaudible] 00:12:08 people from overseas on boards, which may makes sense in certain circumstances and/or any other 00:12:19 of diversity that make up demand."
1D,1D_4,Paul,Now we’ve got [inaudible] 00:00:20 on our screen I can’t see either Margo or you.
1D,1D_40,The participant,"Yeah. So one of the things I think is missing on boards a little bit in Australia that isn’t missing in America is a performance – so sometimes you have boards that are very not diverse, because they’ll have eighth of the 12 people will be very compliance based. And you’ll get a board that gets stuck in this compliance. And really you want to – I think you want a board to help performance as well. So you have that compliance/performance crossover. So in America you have an expression, you either give money, you get money, or you get out. So in a way that’s a very harsh way of saying American boards are – they will try and help the CEO on the performance side. My experience of what I’ve seen on Australian boards is that we don’t have that compliance/performance thing quite worked out yet. So I don’t think we have diversity in that way. I know that’s – but I’m happy to answer as many gender questions as you want."
1D,1D_41,Margo,"Yeah. No, no. We’re not limited to gender. It’s -"
1D,1D_42,Paul,[inaudible] 00:13:30 we’re not focused on gender.
1D,1D_43,Margo,"Yeah, yeah. Definitely not. Some people like you think it’s a non-issue because 48% or 50% of women are on boards. Represent the boards. But possibly, as you pointed out, the larger companies, not such a thing. So we’ll be looking at why do you think that’s not the case."
1D,1D_44,The participant,"No, I can get you some people from boards in that if you want. But you have to give me a few weeks to -"
1D,1D_45,Margo,"Oh yeah, yeah. Paul will – it sounds good, doesn’t it, Paul?"
1D,1D_46,The participant,Yeah. But let’s -
1D,1D_47,Margo,"Let’s move forward. Okay, so do you think diversity of Australian boards is important?"
1D,1D_48,The participant,"Yeah, I think it’s vital. I mean, but I think it’s vital – well, I was having this chat with some board members. In a way, one of the limitations of being on a board is that you don’t know very much. You go in, and you go in there once a month. You’re there for your six hours and you get given what you get given. But in some respects you don’t know enough to add value for one or two years. So you might know in your space – so once again, I suppose I do stress that competency and skills. And the other one is that emotional diversity and the attitude diversity. So I think you do need that for assessment of the CEO. And I suppose it was just very fresh –"
1D,1D_49,The participant,"So the CEO in example wanted to take the $200 million that the sisters had got for the last – and wanted to invest it in doing micro-insurance. Wanted to really expand out and start a business that he could name – that he could put his name to and his sort of – well, he’s 50 and he wanted to say in the next 10 years, I want to be a super success. And I’m happy [inaudible] 00:15:30 but I’m bluffing on two tens or something like that. And the board needed to go, gees, he’s getting some success. Maybe we’ll back him. Maybe we won’t. But to make those kind of – and we ended up saying, actually you’ve gone way too far. You need to stop. And he said, well I’m not stopping. And we said, all right. This is not the organisation for you. So to make that decision, it’s really hard. The board was divided. Really it’s a very, very difficult decision. And what’s that book that it gets expressed? The Wisdom of Teams. To make decisions like that, The Wisdom of Teams is really – I really support the notion behind that book."
1D,1D_5,The participant,"Oh, that’s because I think we need to – oh."
1D,1D_50,Margo,"Okay. There’s a few questions around how that – so we can drill down into that process later on. That’s really good. So you feel that the board’s diversity has have a positive effect on the decision making. You’ve just said yes, definitely. Particularly in this – the assessment of the CEO as an example. So that’s great. So do you feel the board diversity can negatively impact the board’s performance?"
1D,1D_51,The participant,"It has to have a strong chair. A lot depends on the competency of the chair. And the chair – so when you’re in a board, and I know you both know this, you’ve got 12 people and you’re looking around for a natural leader. And if you’ve got – like we’ve got a managing partner of a law firm there, and everyone kind of looks over to him every 20 seconds, just to make sure everything is okay. So if you’ve got a strong chair that can give everyone a voice – so when I’m on the board, I always say to myself, I’m going to be the fourth or the fifth person that’s going to talk. I’m not the most skilled. But I do have value that I can add. And there’ll be a few people that don’t want to talk on an issue. But a chair’s got to allow that. There will be natural leaders in there and the chair does have to be one of those natural leaders to bring that diversity. Otherwise it’s a bit of a rabble."
1D,1D_52,The participant,"Now, I’ve been lucky and had very good chairs. So I haven’t seen – but it is a very complex task to be able to manage 12 people who are different levels of competency, but you’re not really on a board if you’re not broadly competent. I mean, there’s not too many – so yeah, you’ve got to manage – you’ve got to herd those chickens. And if you can do that, and you’ve picked your chair and the chair has been picked well, then I think diversity is a strength."
1D,1D_53,Margo,"Okay, so how do we pick a chair?"
1D,1D_54,The participant,"Yeah, I think you let the natural – a natural leader will emerge. And as much as possible you should let that natural leader be the chair. So I’m not – yeah, so [ Chair], 00:18:36 who’s the chair on the This NFP board, she’s got an Order of Australia. She’s extremely experienced in this space. And so it was just natural that we would defer to her in that case."
1D,1D_55,Margo,She’s was on the board?
1D,1D_56,The participant,"She was on the board previously. We’re trying to get [a particular person] 00:18:56 as the next chair. She’s not on the board at the moment. So the board understands. So you don’t want to have, oh it’s his turn or it’s her turn. You want to be able to control that process to the best of your ability. Not control it, you want it to be – you don’t want the natural leader to be someone who’s part-time and not on the board. Unless that person has deferred a lot of authority to the chair. And then they have to be quite respectful."
1D,1D_57,The participant,"So I have seen, for example, I’ve seen a CEO sacked because – and they were a great CEO. This was a woman CEO, man chair. And she was having a coffee and said oh, I’m not very sure about the competency of the chair. And she was right. But you can’t interfere with the natural authority of the chair. And the chair heard this and the chair said look, I can’t have a board where you’ve said that in public. Or not in public, but to friends and it got back to me. So you have to go. And so that was – and she’s a CEO now of a big company. But she just made a stupid mistake. But that authority of the chair is really important in managing that diversity."
1D,1D_58,Margo,"Okay, that’s interesting. And you say a natural leader. Are there any key attributes or characteristic of that natural leader for the chair?"
1D,1D_59,The participant,"I’ll start by saying, they way you identify it is the way people defer to them. So for example, when we were sacking the CEO, I was on the side to say no. And the board was pretty much divided. Two people resigned over this issue. From the board. But you could see constantly that they were deferring to her. They were just going okay, what do you think of this? We’re in territory we don’t want to be in. So you do identify by seeing who people defer to. So you do need to be cool under pressure. You do need to be decisive. You do need to keep a bigger perspective. I know I’ve been mentioning the competency a lot but the competency is a big deal I think."
1D,1D_6,Margo,Is that better?
1D,1D_60,Margo,"Great, excellent. Okay, so we’re going to talk now about processes. How does diversity influence your board’s functioning? You’ve talked a little bit about it but do you want to perhaps focus on -"
1D,1D_61,Paul,"And perhaps, The participant, just within the context of the research, if we could focus on diversity in terms of gender, social background, ethnic background, et cetera."
1D,1D_62,The participant,Sure. Okay. So give me the question -
1D,1D_63,Paul,[inaudible] 00:21:53
1D,1D_64,Margo,So how does diversity -
1D,1D_65,Paul,-@ just to focus a bit on that.
1D,1D_66,The participant,Sure. Yep.
1D,1D_67,Margo,How does it influence your board’s functioning?
1D,1D_68,The participant,How does diversity -
1D,1D_69,Margo,So like different kinds of diversity might affect functioning differently.
1D,1D_7,Paul,"Yeah, that’s it. I [can tell inaudible] 00:00:32"
1D,1D_70,The participant,"Yeah. I mean, the board – you know that expression, noses in, hands out. So a really good board member will know what questions to ask. And the questions will be phrased – so there’ll be two or three management in there. And the good board member will be able to ask questions that relate to management. That is, not discouraging. Like how could you do this. But they’ll probe – the only tool a board member has got is that board meeting and the questioning. Sothe function – that’s what boards do. They ask questions. If you’ve got a different range of people you will have different questions. And I suppose, you’ll have better questions. Just because you’ll have more of them. If you don’t have gender diversity – and once again, I haven’t been on a board that does that."
1D,1D_71,The participant,"If you had 10 people like me – now, I’m obsessed, for example, with the NFP organisation , of maintaining this corpus of capital and being able to maintain  not for profit organisationfor 100 years. Now, I can’t get away from this series of questions that say along the lines of, how sustainable is this? Have we costed it? Those are my questions that I ask because I understand the numbers very well. Now, they’re nowhere near the right question to ask – so you need an [ Chair] 00:23:49 that says, what’s going to be the impact of this social policy? You need someone – there was a director on the Large not for profit organisation saying, how is this going to relate to other entities? So you do need that variety of questions."
1D,1D_72,The participant,"And I suppose with the gender – I haven't seen too much evidence of this, but I suppose you do get more questions along the lines – I don’t personally ask questions on how will this affect staff, unless I’m reminded. I suppose you do see more questions where – and maybe it’s just through background. So we have a human resources person who’s a woman. And she will always ask, what’s the impact on staff? And I don’t know whether that’s a gender thing or a competency thing, but I suppose I have noticed that you get a further ranger of questions and maybe you get a little bit more holistic organisational questions from the women. I can’t put my hand on my heart but that’s what I’ve seen, I suppose."
1D,1D_73,Margo,"Okay, so if I’m hearing you correctly, it’s more the background. It’s the background of the board member -"
1D,1D_74,The participant,Yeah. You slipped out of view from the call sorry.
1D,1D_75,Margo,Sorry. It’s the background of the board member that you think brings the diversity that’s functionally useful.
1D,1D_76,The participant,Yeah. But having said that though -
1D,1D_77,Margo,[And that should have a gender bias]. 00:25:20
1D,1D_78,The participant,"Well, you don’t want old men, old white men, asking the same questions. You really don’t want that. And I haven’t seen that, but you don’t want 10 people – I suppose I’m counting myself as old. You don’t want 10 people like me, you have accounting backgrounds, who are reasonably well off, who haven’t been in HR, who haven’t been on the front lines with regards to sales for example. I have been on sales, but yeah, you want people with a diversity of backgrounds. And by necessity that will include gender. Now, I think one of the things I think we lack even more than gender is things like, if we’ve got a massive Asian population, if we’re hooked into – so one of the things, for example, that businesses in Australia don’t do very well in, is in hooking with Indonesia and hooking with – China’s nine hours away, but Indonesia is three hours away. Our neighbours, and being able to hook in in that way. So I don’t think we have enough relevant ethnic diversity."
1D,1D_79,Margo,To do that?
1D,1D_8,The participant,You can now see The participant. Can you see Margo?
1D,1D_80,The participant,"To do that. So I think – it’s competency, but you can’t – my wife is Asian. And I only say that because I know enough to know that if you’re not embedded in that culture, you’re wasting your time. You can’t just say, I’ve read a book on it. It’s not enough to do that. So you do need to know contacts. So for example – and this was the ANZ board. It’s an anecdotal story. We were trying to get into business in Indonesia, and there was a guy – a white male boss that says, look, they’re a hard case to crack. We can’t get in there. We’ve just got to do little bit by little bit. And the board member had lived in Indonesia for 20 years. And said, I’m just going to ring up the governor of the bank there. I went to his kids christening. We’re going to – I’ll set up a meeting for you. And you go well, that’s the kind of – if you’ve been there for 20 years, you really know that."
1D,1D_81,The participant,"You can’t read a book and say, oh gee, they’re all a closed shop. So that ethnic diversity, you can get the skills. You can get 80% of the skills. But it’s the last 20% of the skills, and it’s the contacts and it’s the networks and it’s the trustworthiness that – and I suppose that hooks into my performance/compliance. You can be – another example.  We have, when I was at Westpac. I was at ANZ for 20 years. If you lend money to a Samoan, for example. Or if you lend money to an islander, you might write that off after 10 years if they can’t pay it back. Or two years. What happens culturally though is that they’ve got that – they’ve remembered that. And 20 years later they might come and say look, I’m sorry we couldn’t pay it back. But now we can. Here’s the money. And you go – staff are completely –"
1D,1D_82,The participant,"So even on governance, if you run a very legal, contracted sort of economy, you will go by the letter of the law and you need lawyers. But governance in those islands for example might be a different thing. It might be recognising relationships and recognising shame and also recognising a sort of an honour. Because it wasn’t a shame thing. It was more no, no. I made a promise at the time. And I suppose governance would tie through to that. But I suppose I’m more on that performance side, just because I think that that’s what the boards that I have seen are I think a little bit -"
1D,1D_83,Paul,"I might just ask a quite follow on of this, because the time we need to keep moving. But in the context of say your SuniTAFE board, given the business and the business model and the industry you’re in, do you see gender, ethnic diversity, possibly age, would be important? Or even social diversity in terms of socioeconomic backgrounds or origins?"
1D,1D_84,The participant,"Yeah, so I suppose SuniTAFE– China has come into Mildura in a big way. The Chinese, they like to invest in education. They like to invest in a lot of things. They love to invest in agriculture. That’s something that they're obsessed with. Locking in food security is something that – you can go quite high up in Chinese government if you talk agriculture. And not so much if you’re talking other things. So the point is, so yes, SuniTAFE, it would be really good if you had a ethnic Chinese person on that board. The other thing to – so we don’t. The other thing that SuniTAFE – so SuniTAFE does have – it has 12 people. I suppose on there I’m the governance/accounting side. It has about five business people. And they are old white men, like me. But they are – one is the biggest dealer in Mildura. The other one is the biggest grape grower. The other one is someone who controls the whole IT for the Mallee region. So I like the fact that -"
1D,1D_85,Margo,Useful skills.
1D,1D_86,The participant,"- those are very useful skills. The chair runs a law practise. And we probably need diversity in the way that you would get government – because TAFEs and universities are crucially linked into government. And government has their own way of talking and their own network. So for example, the previous chair of SuniTAFE lost her job because she didn’t have a good relationship with government. So the Minister just said – it wasn’t good, it was just neutral. And so when the Minister came to see her [refresh form] 00:32:00 he just – I don’t really know this person. So look, you do need – yes, ethnic diversity is really important. Also I suppose sometimes I think what you might be fishing for is that women directors are more empathic with students, they’re more empathic with – and I haven’t seen that. I’ve seen empathy across both genders. So I suppose I’m not going down that road."
1D,1D_87,Margo,You don’t have to.
1D,1D_88,The participant,"Yeah, and because I’ve seen women directors be hard or harder than I have at that level someone – yeah. So for example, when we were sacking the CEO for NFP organisation , it was driven by the chair. The woman chair. In fact she was – the other two chairs which were male weren’t decisive on it. And this issue had been going for a little while. And she was the one that said, we’re going to fix this up. We’re going to close it off right now. And it wasn’t – it was just as hard as you would imagine. So I’m not going down that road because I haven't seen it."
1D,1D_89,Margo,"That’s good. That’s what we want is your evidence. Yeah, from your experience. So can you think of ways that boards can help directors form minority groups to feel part of the board and to really contribute to decision making?"
1D,1D_9,Margo,It doesn’t matter.
1D,1D_90,The participant,"Well, one of the boards I was on was an international house at Melbourne Uni, I was a resident there. And I was the tutor representative. And I do like – so at SuniTAFE there is a staff representative. I do like that. If you can – so I really like – although it’s hard to do sometimes because sometimes you’ve got issues that affect those people. The other thing I like is I like mentoring programs. So I like the chair saying, look, I’ve got staff member – I know it’s hard, but I do like mentoring programs that work both ways. So you do get the voice of kind of the customer at that point in time. I have seen lots of 360 stuff happen. And I do think that is good as well."
1D,1D_91,Margo,So that helps?
1D,1D_92,The participant,"Yeah, I think so. I don’t like it, because it shines a light on it. But it’s the bit – you know how you don’t like – no-ones likes performance appraisals for example, but they’re very useful. So I think the 360 is just like that."
1D,1D_93,Margo,"Okay, and what did you mean by issues that affect – you can have issues that affect people? You didn’t finish that."
1D,1D_94,The participant,"No, that train fell off the rails. Sorry."
1D,1D_95,Margo,"Okay, it’s all right. So the minority people, the chair – you did describe the chair doing that. Is there something that other board members might do to enable or board selection?"
1D,1D_96,The participant,Is that minority groups -
1D,1D_97,Margo,Within the board.
1D,1D_98,The participant,Within the board?
1D,1D_99,Margo,"Within the board, like we might have one person in the  not for profit organisation board, for example, you might have one director who actually is close to the consumer needs or service needs of your -"
20D,20D_1,A,Don’t rush.
20D,20D_10,Q,"What we’re doing is we’re interviewing Australian directors of companies of different kinds and organisations that influence or govern them.  And the idea is to understand board diversity from their perspective, and to develop a model based on that understanding, and some ideas about how it can be managed, leaders and barriers.  That’s sort of the game.  First, how have the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?"
20D,20D_100,Q,"Did you see it coming, though?"
20D,20D_101,A,"I wasn’t on the Cochlear, but the hearing kids have Cochlear that I worked with, and so I’m not representing Cochlear.  Did they see it coming?  No.  Not to the degree it came and not how accessible it came, and not that people put profit before product, but they always will."
20D,20D_102,Q,"Now, board functioning;  we want to understand how diversity influences board functioning.  Are there particular functions that it’s really useful for, irrelevant to?"
20D,20D_103,A,"You’ve got to go back to what is the function of the board.  The function of the board is to steward, that’s number 1;  duty of care for people;  to set the strategy, to ensure that risk is being taken care of, and for the CEO to report into.  They are not to get day to day operational, but they absolutely have to work with the CEO.  Diversity to me is critical because all those - and is that what you asked?  So for the board to function on its strategy, it must think about, again, the community, the people, the customers, so diversity’s the only way to do that."
20D,20D_104,A,"Risk, it’s global now.  Risk is so global that you can’t now just look and look insular, you just can’t.  From a duty of care to your people, again, it’s about your people mix.  As stewardship - well, stewardship’s a really interesting one.  I think that even that word’s a bit old-fashioned.  It almost sounds like the captain of the boat, and the captain of the boat was always male."
20D,20D_105,Q,"Yes, but a [soft hand] 00:24:06."
20D,20D_106,A,"Yeah, yeah, but I don’t disagree with it.  It is still driving the boat or whatever you call it.  So should that be gender-specific?  No;  again, it has to be diverse.  But that’s the one that I think people were a little bit brave to make the chair also gender-aware.  So I often think that stewardship - on boards they think that’s the chair, but, actually, I don’t.  I think it’s everybody’s responsibility.  And so it’s communal on the directors."
20D,20D_107,A,"And then working together is another critical part of one of the journeys of the boards.  I mean, strategy, risk, all of those functions, absolutely.  The CEO, working with the CEO, well, I would hope the CEO would want broad thinking for them to challenge their own operation, and also for their own operation to see they’re being guided by diverse thinking.  But it’s that stewardship where I think we’ve still got a very big mindset shift to come."
20D,20D_108,Q,"And because that can focus the lens on the chair, that’s a conservative influence?"
20D,20D_109,A,"It can be, very much so.  And I have seen more male chairs through my time until recently, until the last two years."
20D,20D_11,A,"Over the dozen-odd years that I’ve seen working on boards, I’ve seen the calibre of people uplift.  Previously, particularly because I started on a not-for-profit board, they felt privileged that people would join their board.  But that has changed so dramatically in the last, probably, six years, that there’s a far greater pool of people out there with incredible competencies wanting to join boards."
20D,20D_110,Q,And the female chairs that you’ve seen?
20D,20D_111,A,Have only been in the last two years.
20D,20D_112,Q,Only in the last two years?
20D,20D_113,A,"I haven’t seen female chairs from the first 10 years, which is that interesting -"
20D,20D_114,Q,"And do they function differently to men, chairs?"
20D,20D_115,A,I think they add a different perspective.
20D,20D_116,Q,So they’re functioning as women.
20D,20D_117,A,"And I don’t think they’re trying to act as men in any way.  I’ve seen incredible deep thought from them, and I’ve found that they’re far more less hierarchical.  Far less hierarchical."
20D,20D_118,Q,So then the stewardship model is everyone.
20D,20D_119,A,"It’s shared.  Exactly, exactly.  And that’s what I’m saying should occur.  I mean, the chair has a place, don’t get me wrong.  Very critical place."
20D,20D_12,Q,Why do you think they want to join them?
20D,20D_120,Q,"Now, I’d like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards.  And if so, how conflict can be managed.  And I’ve had people discuss conflict, the difference between that and -"
20D,20D_121,A,Robust discussion.
20D,20D_122,Q,"Exactly, the latter being essential.  And others have used the word ‘conflict’ and said, “That’s essential”.  So let’s not get stuck in the words."
20D,20D_123,A,"No, I won’t get stuck in that.  I like to give from my perspective.  I think the more diverse thinking you have on a board, the more robust the discussion is.  I just think that one equals two.  If you have the diverse thinking, you will get the robust discussion because people are thinking outside the box, and we want that.  So for one to be gender diverse, of course you’re going to get more robust thinking, diverse thinking, so that’s perfect.  And that’s a board’s role.  It’s to challenge respectfully."
20D,20D_124,A,"I’m not going to - so conflict would have happened - conflict is such a different thing, and for me conflict isn’t difference of opinion;  conflict is where you can’t resolve in a board an issue.  And that’s where a chair is critical, to try to allow that robust discussion.  For me, if you have conflict on boards, it’s very important the directors address that very quickly.  It’s like any discussion off a board or on a board, you have to give and take.  And you’ve always got to bring it back to what are you trying to drive?  What is the ship, what is the purpose, and who’s our customer and community."
20D,20D_125,A,"If you keep it level at that, you’ll always be able to find a middle ground.  And it doesn’t mean that someone loses;  it means who has the biggest win.  Sometimes you have to bring that back, and I think a really good chair will always bring back, ‘What is our purpose’, and will resolve that conflict.  Because without diverse thinking, you’ll never get to that challenging thinking, and we need challenge on a board, we need it."
20D,20D_126,Q,"That’s great, thank you.  Can you give me an example of where you’ve had this robust discussion?"
20D,20D_127,A,"Absolutely;  got one right now.  But you can’t quote my board.  You can say it’s a public hospital, but you can’t say the exact board."
20D,20D_128,Q,"Oh, no, no.  No, it’s confidential."
20D,20D_129,A,"It’s health.  But I’m more than happy for you to write it down, yeah.  We’ve just got to be careful because it’ll be obvious if I’m too specific."
20D,20D_13,A,"For me, there’s been a lot more females and younger generation.  Boards have become, I think, dispelled from being something that was always quite exclusive and the same people with the same skills.  I think we’ve broadened our thinking.  And I actually think it’s been governments lobbying, and people like the Champions of Change and Women On Boards in particular, because they’ve been over that period out there advocating.  So now there’s a lot of inner reflection, and I’m seeing matrix skills being used far more in the last, probably, five to six years."
20D,20D_130,A,"We have a clinical issue at the moment - and this was a fabulous example, in fact - of whether or not we allow a certain thing in a hospital that other hospitals clearly said - let’s just say it’s smoking - “We do not allow smoking”.  I’m going to use that as the example, but it’s not the truth.  “We do not allow smoking”, and it was critical, it could end up in death.  But so can a lot of things.  So can smoking;  smoke enough, you die.  But we hadn’t put on our website that we condone 100% smoking."
20D,20D_131,A,"And the reason was, we had at this particular health facility customers would come from prisons, backgrounds of drugs, really tough environments because of where geographically it’s positioned.  We would have to turn those people away and no-one else will take them if we put that statement on there.  Whereas other hospitals put it on, and if they’re caught smoking, they’re sent home, even if it’s 2 in the morning.  But for our customers, where the hell are they going to go, and we need to help them get better to get back to a really good social environment."
20D,20D_132,A,"So we made a decision, we condone it, absolutely, but we didn’t advertise it.  Instead, we managed it.  If someone did smoke, yes, they could die from that last cigarette because one’s going to get you and it could be during your time at our hospital.  But we said we would rather sit with them and try to convince them not to smoke, and put all these things in place - low tar cigarettes, e-cigarettes, whatever they might be.  “We will stand with you to make sure you don’t fall over from that last cigarette and have the heart machine ready”.  We put in every possible thing, and we will actually spend more time with you, and we had it all documented, what were all the things to do if we saw someone smoking."
20D,20D_133,A,"Certainly when we brought them in and we inducted them, we said, “We do not allow smoking”.  But we know they’re smoking anyway.  Look at them, that’s why they’re in hospital."
20D,20D_134,Q,So harm mitigation?
20D,20D_135,A,"Exactly.  But we were not prepared to say, as a hospital, “We are not going to accept patients who smoke in our hospitals”."
20D,20D_136,Q,Because you know your community.
20D,20D_137,A,"Exactly, exactly.  And geographically, the people who needed to come to our hospital would have been turned away."
20D,20D_138,Q,And that was the point of your service.
20D,20D_139,A,"And a particular board member brought it onto herself, and she didn’t realise - she said a patient could die with that last cigarette.  It wasn’t a cigarette, it was more serious.  We said, “But what about all the other patients who could fall over and die?  Or who could jump over the damn ledge and suicide?”.  Just because everyone else said that’s their one thing because it’s socially not acceptable to smoke anymore.  Patients die every day in hospital.  We’re always at risk."
20D,20D_14,Q,"With the gender diversity, we’ve then got a skills mix coming in which measures things like -"
20D,20D_140,A,"And so she had only thought about - and she absolutely lobbied every director to say, “We don’t have this on our website, and everybody else says” - “and why are we accepting people who smoke”.  We actually went and we brought the CEO and the operational head of clinical to come in, and they said, “We’d probably do more because those other people are still smoking and they’re all turning a blind eye”.  Because, unfortunately, any habit you’re going to hide, so we’d rather not hide it, and we’d rather help.  Work with it."
20D,20D_141,A,"And it nearly came to the point where they started to lobby other people, and it was the health people that started to say, “Oh my god, we were allowing smoking?”, and we said no - and so it was the diverse thinkers, actually, on the board.  It was those of us who weren’t clinical that said, “Hang on, no offence, what about all these other deaths that could happen?”.  And then we brought in - we said, “No, we need evidence, we’ve got to be prepared that someone could always die in our very specialised hospital, always”.  So you’ve got to be aware our brand could get hurt."
20D,20D_142,A,"But the duty of care says not just to our staff.  Our staff have a whole process that we would feel comfortable - and we asked the staff this one question, the head of the whole clinical, “Would you be prepared to go up to the coroner’s court or coroner’s hospital” - whatever it’s called, I don’t know what it is."
20D,20D_143,Q,Coroner’s court.
20D,20D_144,A,"“Hand on heart and say, ‘We did everything we could and we have no guilt’”, and they said, “Absolutely”.  And I said, “As long as that’s the culture for the staff, that we’re not forcing them to do something they feel is wrong”.  And we were able to actually dissipate the issue."
20D,20D_145,Q,"And you could indemnify, obviously."
20D,20D_146,A,Yeah.
20D,20D_147,Q,Beautiful.
20D,20D_148,A,"Sorry, it’s a long example.  I think it absolutely describes robust discussion.  And if it hadn’t had us non-clinical people on that director’s thing, that would have gone on our website, we would have turned away all those patients."
20D,20D_149,Q,"And it’s fantastic because it goes back to your elements of the functioning of the board, how diversity plays a role at those -"
20D,20D_15,A,"Do you know some of the new ones?  What was traditionally - I didn’t even see skills matrixes 12 years ago.  Now I’m seeing that we’ve got to keep up with what’s happening in the broader environment.  Because most companies are in a global environment to some extent, or being influenced by disrupters, by the digital footprint out there, by fraud.  So I’m seeing a lot more looking at understanding our customer base, but also the broader environment."
20D,20D_150,A,"And it was me and a few others that said, “Duty of care, risks are much bigger than that”.  And our staff.  Exactly.  Is it affecting our culture, but, no, it was the opposite.  And what was so beautiful, our culture said, “We’re the only place that takes them”.  These people would be on the street dying.  And that’s why I was so proud of the staff for how - it was the only time I allowed operational through the CEO to bring in for this particular issue, but we had to.  We had to hear it as directors."
20D,20D_151,Q,"Yes, exactly.  And there are other stakeholders, like professional bodies, that might - professional health regulation, professional bodies, their indemnity insurers and things like that.  So you negotiated that as well so that the operations were supported."
20D,20D_152,A,"We did.  We basically said the fact we haven’t said anything does not mean we do or don’t support.  We have a process that will stand up, and we made sure our process would stand up."
20D,20D_153,Q,That’s great.  So that’s just to show how it’s multilayered.
20D,20D_154,A,"It was fabulous.  And it was only because - and otherwise it would have gone on the website, and we would have turned away the most needy people on the streets."
20D,20D_155,Q,And your purpose would have been compromised.
20D,20D_156,A,"Absolutely, absolutely."
20D,20D_157,Q,"Fantastic example.  Now, there’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and board function.  Do you feel that cognitive diversity influences your board’s functioning?  Is this a positive or negative influence?  You’ve [already] [inaudible] 00:35:02.  Now, this is about potential new members.  Does your board consider ways to increase the diversity of the board?"
20D,20D_158,A,Absolutely.
20D,20D_159,Q,What does it do?  What are some ideas?
20D,20D_16,A,"I’m seeing people wanting not just finance or commercial skills, but digital innovation skills, commercial skills with maybe a bit of marketing from a brand perspective because that’s so much more recognised how quickly that can dissipate.  I’m seeing far more broad diversity from industry, so not just getting health people for a health board, and I’m seeing far more interesting balance in boards from a gender perspective."
20D,20D_160,A,"So we as the executive - we have an executive, and that moves as well.  It’s the chairs of the board and a couple of committees we call the executive.  And we sit there to look at who’s currently on the board, and we get everybody on our board to self-assess what skills they have.  We identify a whole lot of skills either we need or don’t need, what we consider are skillsets, and we say, to start with, “Let’s see what skills we have”, and then we look at how broad that is."
20D,20D_161,A,"And even if we think we may not need those skills, to drive diversity of thought, we look at, ‘What’s our cross-function’, and if we think these other ones are completely missing and our community might need us to do that - and we should because we serve everyone - that’s what we look for.  So we do evidence gap analysis to say, ‘Where is it we’re not strong’, and we try to balance that way.  We also look at it from - so that’s the skills one that we always do."
20D,20D_162,Q,Am I able to have a copy of your skills matrix?  Or is it confidential?
20D,20D_163,A,"I wonder if I’ve got an old one.  I actually don’t even know if I’ve got one.  Because [inaudible] 00:36:22 a portal that we can’t share from.  But if I could print one out, I think - I don’t know if I can because I think they’re protected."
20D,20D_164,Q,"Are they?  Yeah, see, I have no idea."
20D,20D_165,A,You’ve not seen the skills matrix?
20D,20D_166,Q,On Google.
20D,20D_167,A,"Okay.  If you send me an email and remind me.  Not now, but I’m terrible when I go back, I’m going to get kicked by my staff, and I’ll see if I can find you one.  And I’ll take names out."
20D,20D_168,Q,"So when do you want me to send it, next week?"
20D,20D_169,A,"The email?  Oh, no, you can just follow up with an email."
20D,20D_17,Q,"So might a health board get someone from, say, a mining industry?"
20D,20D_170,Q,"Oh, good, okay."
20D,20D_171,A,I’m saying just send me an email to remind me.  If I can - I’ll go on the portal and have a look.
20D,20D_172,Q,Thank you.
20D,20D_173,A,I get to my emails within a week.
20D,20D_174,Q,No urgency.
20D,20D_175,A,"No, and if I have I’ll send you one."
20D,20D_176,Q,"I understand, that’ll be great."
20D,20D_177,A,But I’m not sure if I can get it.
20D,20D_178,Q,"Understand.  Do people outside the board influence your selection, who you select?"
20D,20D_179,A,"What an interesting question.  Yes, absolutely.  So on a health board, you are responsible - now, can I give you this as multi - if you’ve got time - and I’ll give you my experience."
20D,20D_18,A,"Absolutely.  I’ve been on health boards now for 12 years and I’ve never worked in health.  And I was invited - and it was quite an innovative, specific board;  they didn’t want more of the same of what they had.  They had people who understood the actual specialist skill which was hearing and children, and they actually needed other skills to think more broadly."
20D,20D_180,Q,Absolutely.  Because you’ve got - we are doing so well.
20D,20D_181,A,"Oh, good.  Oh, thank you.  So this is - can you ask that question again so I’ve got it clear?  Do outside influence - yes."
20D,20D_182,Q,Do people outside the board influence your selection?
20D,20D_183,A,"Okay.  On NFP, we were influenced by the people who put the money - the biggest philanthropists.  Because they had the children who initially they’d built the facility for.  Because there’s always philanthropists in NFPs.  And I’ve been on quite a few different boards."
20D,20D_184,A,"On public boards for Victorian Government, it’s a government agency that gets the final say, and the most annoying thing about that is, if I can just say - so if you’re a health board, basically it’s DHHS, let’s just put it out there.  If you’re a hospital, DHHS.  You can submit with every reason - we actually submit our skillset and it’s all on the safe portal for government - show our reasoning, we give our reasons why we choose these people or [inaudible] 00:38:13 people on the board."
20D,20D_185,A,"You can be sure that they will not take our recommendation after all that work.  What they’ll do is they’ll often put one of their own people on that board and substitute one of ours out.  And I’ve seen it - off the record - many times.  But don’t ask me why.  And there’s never a reason why.  And when we see the person they give us, it’s not trying to fill those skillsets up is all I’m going to say.  So, yes, there are other people that you have to get approved on."
20D,20D_186,A,"On another board I sat on which was more education, it was more the members - the students, the members - that influenced to some degree removing people off the board.  So I’ve seen both."
20D,20D_187,Q,The members of the -
20D,20D_188,A,"Well, that was CPA.  I’ve got to be very careful.  They basically said - because they own the company.  So when it’s the -"
20D,20D_189,Q,Own shareholders - stakeholders -
20D,20D_19,A,"And they actually approached me and said, “Look, we need your particular treasury and procurement skills”, which was - I didn’t even really - thought about it.  And they said, “Because we keep getting the same male accountants that do the same thing, auditing and risk, and we want a different perspective”, so that’s how they came to me."
20D,20D_190,A,"Let’s call them stakeholders.  They’re stakeholders.  And that’s happening now.  They’re voting for directors not to be renewed on boards, and this is something new.  Because of digital media - and I think it’s a great thing - social media, and accessibility to voting rights, et cetera, people are actually voting people off boards, and this is new.  I actually experienced that on a board.  And rightly so or not, it doesn’t matter.  But it was something that - we had to listen to our stakeholders, so that’s the new thing."
20D,20D_191,A,"So I have seen all different things happen.  But then have they listened on ASX-listed boards in the past?  Maybe not, but now they’re having to.  It’s a new environment."
20D,20D_192,Q,"Radically new.  Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process?  For example, between, on the one hand, obtaining a good culture, collegiate fit, and on the other, to avoid groupthink?"
20D,20D_193,A,"Brilliant question, brilliant.  On one of my first boards, I was very privileged that - we’d decided - and we raised the funds through a sponsorship, philanthropic whatever it was, so as not to spend the kids’ money.  We recognised that was occurring to some degree, that the groupthink was too influential, but we needed the groupthink because it was a very specialised facility."
20D,20D_194,A,"What we did was we brought someone from outside, who was a facilitator, to take us off-site as a board to explain - without even knowing too much about what we did - what was the criticality of not falling into groupthink, and so they helped us drive our strategy.  By using a facilitator, it helped us stop that groupthink.  Because we had to challenge the strategy, but the strategy was just very much the same thinking.  And I’d only recently come on the board, and they started to try and bring diverse people, but what they did was - this external facilitator, being an independent, helped break that.  And they stayed with us for board meetings for the next year."
20D,20D_195,Q,So you had coaching for over a year?
20D,20D_196,A,"Exactly, but they also coached the CEO.  Because they were such a specialist.  Because often you’ll find the CEO - and we recognise - the CEO helps set the agenda for a board, let’s be honest.  But it was coming from them as much as from us that we were always talking the same things.  And we said, “No, we’ve got to get brave, how do we do this”."
20D,20D_197,A,"So it wasn’t just to coach us, it was to help coach the CEO to think broadly and what were the true issues that they should be bringing to the board.  They helped the CEO recognise what were the really big items that we could help stewards.  We did it on both areas.  And, I tell you what, it worked magnificently.  But we slowly weaned them out so they became less and less influential, but they watched to make sure we had adopted the thinking."
20D,20D_198,A,"And I was so privileged to be a part of that so early in my directorship that I’ve carried it ever since.  I’ve often said, “Get an external, just even for a day for us”.  Because it’s pointless you all going into a strategy meeting with the same thing.  And so I find that if you bring an external - a good one, and there’s the question, ‘How do you find a good one’, but they’re out there.  Get someone to challenge your thinking, but also who recognises, ‘Is it coming from the board or is it coming from the CEO driving the board’.  And they were the ones that recognised, ‘It’s coming from the board, yes, but it’s coming from the CEO;  we need to work on both’.  And it worked terrifically."
20D,20D_199,Q,Is there any way I could interview someone like that?
20D,20D_2,Q,"We’re recording, okay.  20D, thank you so much for agreeing to be interviewed for our study.  I just have a few questions before we get into it.  So you’re female; discipline background?"
20D,20D_20,A,"And I think they were trying to balance it, also, from a female point of view because the finance and risk team in particular had far more males than females.  I think they thought broadly, and I think there’d been a change in chair as well, and they wanted to bring in different skillsets so that’s where that came from.  And although I’ve been on health boards, I’ve done that probably because it is something quite lateral to my day job, the industries I’ve been in, and I feel that I can be that diverse thinker in the room."
20D,20D_200,A,Sorry?
20D,20D_201,Q,Any way I could interview someone like that?
20D,20D_202,A,"Who’s a facilitator for boards?  They’re not in Victoria, that’s the only problem."
20D,20D_203,Q,We’ll talk about later -
20D,20D_204,A,"All right.  You can put that on the email and I’ll see what I can do.  But I don’t even know if they’re still - it’s about 10 years ago, and I’m not sure they haven’t retired or even if they’re alive.  Let me check.  They were a bit older.  You never know."
20D,20D_205,Q,"Yes, and they probably won’t donate their time."
20D,20D_206,A,"Oh, you never know."
20D,20D_207,Q,"Yep, they might, their swansong.  Do the boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity, and so what are they?"
20D,20D_208,A,"Could you say that again, sorry?"
20D,20D_209,Q,What are the barriers that any boards you’re working on have to building diversity?  What’s holding them back?
20D,20D_21,Q,And you value that?
20D,20D_210,A,"Look, you tend to have on boards - and this is another one that I fell into years ago.  There were people that were - given so much of their time to the board, and could you chop them?  Do not recommend them for renewal.  It’s that courage to say, “How much of this is occurring”.  And it’s very difficult, if they’ve committed themselves, and particularly when they retire, in my opinion."
20D,20D_211,A,"And so often you needed to swap out men to bring in women, or swap out the white - someone told me the term at the AICD recently is “stale white bread”.  I said, “I’ve never heard that in all my career”.  I only heard that a week or two ago.  “Stale white bread”, which means males that are white.  And I said - and they called themselves that.  I said, “I’ve never heard that term”.  But do you get that sort of older, “This I my job, I’ve earnt it”.  How do you break that?  How do you break having too much of that and non-diverse?  And that was really hard.  And I saw this in one of my early boards, that they expected a third tenure.  And to be honest, I wouldn’t have given them one."
20D,20D_212,A,"I actually thing second tenures are great on a three-year term, I really do.  Because I think it takes a year, maybe, to learn to listen, new on a board.  It takes second year to get the courage.  You’re still the new kid.  Until you’re into that third year or second tenure, you’re still pretty much the new one if you have someone come off every year, which is what you’re meant to do, say, on a 10-person board.  But once you’re talking that third term, does everybody get a third term?  Or do you get brave and say, “We’ve got enough three to six year people, we probably only need one if that”.  Things are moving too quickly and they’re probably not coming on the journey."
20D,20D_213,A,"And that’s the thing.  I find tenure and that commitment, people aren’t brave enough to say that that skillset - they don’t look at the skillset, they look at the person, that’s it.  They haven’t thought about this.  They look at the person and say, “Oh, but they’ve given so much to the industry”, and, “Oh my god, they’ve given us six years of their life and they expect to be back on”.  But if we’ve got a bit of that already, we need this new world thinking.  How do we get it?  Well, they’ve had their time.  And that’s one of the hugest barriers I find, is people are not brave enough.  And more so if they’re the chair, if they’ve been the chair or if they are the chair."
20D,20D_214,A,"And the other thing I’ve found very stagnant is we might have three-year terms for directors, but crikey, I’ve seen chairs that have sat there for six years.  Don’t say that ain’t still happening because it is."
20D,20D_215,Q,How do you get chairs off?
20D,20D_216,A,"Well, you’ve got to have a policy that says their tenure is one year or two years.  And I think one year’s too short for a chair, I think two years is perfect.  But that’s just what I’m feeling.  But it’s very difficult."
20D,20D_217,Q,"Sorry, there’s a name of a document that frames the governance of the board.  What’s it called again?"
20D,20D_218,A,"Well, the governance -"
20D,20D_219,Q,Is it a constitution or something?
20D,20D_22,A,"Absolutely, absolutely."
20D,20D_220,A,"Oh, yes.  Constitution, absolutely."
20D,20D_221,Q,Is that where that’s written?
20D,20D_222,A,"Absolutely.  And it has tenure, and it should have the chair tenure as well.  Now, I have been on a board where it was annual renewal, and they had two deputies, and it was expected - now, I was also on a committee where I was the president, and your second term was very rare, but sometimes your own people asked you to do a second, but you’d never do a third.  You had to let the next people for thinking, and for chairing, and for stewarding.  I think that’s as critical as the constituents on the board."
20D,20D_223,Q,"Okay, the chair -"
20D,20D_224,A,"The chair position also having a tenure period.  I just think that changes and keeps you alive.  Because otherwise you fall into a pattern.  But I can tell you now, I haven’t seen enough of it."
20D,20D_225,Q,So that is a barrier.
20D,20D_226,A,An absolute barrier.
20D,20D_227,Q,And gender targets and quotas aren’t going to touch the chair.
20D,20D_228,A,"Isn’t that interesting?  Well, I think tenure full stop has to be looked at very seriously for the chair."
20D,20D_229,Q,"So we’ve got targets, but we need tenure.  That’s the gap."
20D,20D_23,Q,What does it give you?
20D,20D_230,A,"Tenure, particularly for the chair.  I think that’s the gap for the chair.  And maybe it’s not just tenure for the chair;  maybe it’s gender for the chair and rotating that for diversity of thought.  But I think by approaching tenure, you’d get that if your board is diverse thinking.  Because you can only get three stale white bread.  You can’t, because we’ve got a diverse board.  And I think that the chair position is the critical position for any committee or board."
20D,20D_231,Q,"This really brings us to our last question, which is:  finally, looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
20D,20D_232,A,"That nobody has a position on a board more than six years, two terms, without it being by absolute exception, that’s fine;  that we rotate chairs;  that we look at the number on boards and we be brave to challenge that maybe each three years.  Because why are they 10, why are they 12?  Nobody ever tells you why.  How did we arrive at this?  Should there be 20 for a year because we’ve got a tough year and we need all this diversity, or should there be five?"
20D,20D_233,A,"That diversity of thought and the skills matrix are absolutely part of every constitution;  that all these are addressed in a constitution, and that we absolutely look at age as well in part of this.  And that we relate it to our purpose.  So our boards must be reliant, I think, to the, ‘What is it we’re trying to achieve’.  And then I think the global community.  And maybe there’ll come a time with virtual reality that we’ll look at global boards, global thinking."
20D,20D_234,A,"And that’s the one that I think that even now, there’s this absolute rule - and this is another thing that I haven’t mentioned that annoys me, and I don’t mind it, but we restrict people with young kids, I feel, because you have to be there, and the timing of the board is so critical, and it’s got to be in the evening, and there’s got to be red wine, and blah-blah.  That takes out so many mothers."
20D,20D_235,A,"And for me it was the biggest challenge that there were evening boards, and I could never be on more than one or two, and I was on two.  Because I’ve got kids, and I just felt - and so there weren’t many of me on these boards.  Because it’s just too hard.  Weeknights - god damn, the kids and [inaudible] 00:50:20.  And let alone that 25% are single mums.  Forget that.  They have to get babysitters and - oh my god, it gets so hard."
20D,20D_236,A,"But, look, I did it, and I did it as a single mum, and I did do it with babysitters because I really, really love boards, the challenge, and I wanted to help this thing.  But I think we’ve got to get away from that and say, “What is the outcome you’re trying to achieve, how do we address that to make people feel like they’re part of a group”.  And maybe sometimes all being in the same room isn’t the best thing.  Maybe we are better to have people in different geographies."
20D,20D_237,Q,"And we’ve got virtual video, teleconferencing, whatever."
20D,20D_238,A,"Teleconferencing.  Imagine then, holograms will be in.  Or whatever it is."
20D,20D_239,Q,"Oh, wouldn’t that be great?"
20D,20D_24,A,"I’ve got so much out of this because - I always think these places that I’ve been on boards have a purpose, and they’ve always known their purpose.  They’ve been very purpose-driven.  So for me, even though I don’t have that particular purpose directly relating to me - such as hearing, I didn’t have a child or a family member.  Maybe some selective hearing, but I didn’t have that cause.  It allowed me to give back to a cause and an industry that I wasn’t currently contributing to.  So very rewarding for me as well, but also learning from those other people on the board that didn’t have the same skillset as me."
20D,20D_240,A,"And so that’s why I’m saying I think we have to challenge all of it.  And then maybe challenge is stewardship really - is even a 10-person board the right thing with a mix of externals?  What is it?  I would love us to do design thinking and say, “Well, what is a board, is it 10 people?  What is it?”, so I think that that’s where we’ve got to challenge.  Because at the moment we’re challenging the gender.  But, okay, the constitution say you must have a board, what is a board?  And maybe we should have a few kids on that board, or maybe we should have a few people from overseas - I don’t know.  I don’t know, I haven’t done the design thinking.  But let’s challenge, ‘What is a board’."
20D,20D_241,Q,"Beautiful.  That’s fantastic.  To enable that to happen, you’ve mentioned the constitution."
20D,20D_242,A,"Well, it’s also broader, it’s the company directors - not directors, the corporate law."
20D,20D_243,Q,Corporate law.
20D,20D_244,A,"So I think it’s called the - oh, god.  I even knew -"
20D,20D_245,Q,That’s all right.
20D,20D_246,A,"The corporations law.  The corporations law said, “If you’re this sort of entity, you’re required to have this sort of da-da-da”.  But we need to challenge it.  And particularly for government boards.  They need to go back to design thinking more than anyone."
20D,20D_247,Q,"That’s a very hard one, with all the politics at the moment."
20D,20D_248,A,"Yeah, I know."
20D,20D_249,Q,So fantastic.  Loved it.  Thank you.
20D,20D_25,Q,"I really like that.  That’s sort of a new spin just today, about how being on a diverse board benefits the board, the directors themselves."
20D,20D_250,A,Good.  Thank you.
20D,20D_251,Q,Thank you so much.
20D,20D_26,A,Absolutely.
20D,20D_27,Q,"So how does it benefit the - I should ask you first, do the quant.  This is our quant.  Let’s say 10 is extremely important and one is not important.  How important is diversity of a board?"
20D,20D_28,A,"Oh, it’s 10."
20D,20D_29,Q,And do you feel that it’s always been important?  Or is this a recent phenomenon?
20D,20D_3,A,"An accountant, Bachelor of Business."
20D,20D_30,A,"I can only talk, I suppose - no, I can actually speak about boards that I’ve worked in companies because I’ve always had to prepare reports and whatever to boards.  I’ve reported to boards as well, obviously, and I still do to this day;  as in, I prepare - either CFO or director or finance or even GM, you’re always preparing information for boards.  And I’ve done that for many, many years in some form."
20D,20D_31,A,"I don’t think it was as important when I started.  Maybe seeing a bit of board culture and consistency of how they were formed I think has become more important in the last - again, I’m going to say half a dozen years."
20D,20D_32,Q,"Half a dozen?  Okay, so probably -"
20D,20D_33,A,"For me, really critical."
20D,20D_34,Q,"What’s that, 2013?"
20D,20D_35,A,"I really feel it’s been - and I think Women On Boards has had a huge drive on this more than AICD, I’m going to say that.  And Women On Boards in particular have been in the forefront of advocacy.  And I think I became a member of them probably about six, eight years ago - maybe eight, maybe a bit longer.  And I’ve seen the work they’ve done and just how far they’ve come in such a short time.  I don’t think they’ve been around more than 20 years.  Maybe 10, I’m not sure;  you’d know more than me.  But, boy, they’ve made a difference."
20D,20D_36,Q,So why do you think board diversity is so important?
20D,20D_37,A,"It’s diversity of thought.  For me it’s not gender;  it’s thought.  And so I look for, again, that matrix of skills, but also the way we think, and the industries we’ve come from, and the exposure we’ve had.  And I think the best example is you know in your own team, if you just keep employing the same people with the same skillsets, with the same experience, you’ll just get the same thinking, and nobody’s going to challenge."
20D,20D_38,A,"So for me, I look for design thinking where we are brave enough to ask someone without the skillset the discussion point and what’s their opinion, and you’ll nearly always get a fresh idea that you haven’t thought of."
20D,20D_39,Q,That’s real out-of-the-square thinking.
20D,20D_4,Q,And are you on Australian boards?
20D,20D_40,A,"Yeah, and that’s why you do it.  And I always think to myself, ‘The board has’ - from AICD, there were two things I always took away from all the years I’ve been involved.  One was you’re the stewardship;  you’re the stewardship for the company.  But the other one that’s always resonated with me was the duty of care.  Because in most companies, it’s your people that make the difference.  And that duty of care does not need the thinking of the industry;  they need the thinking of the people.  Because you drive the people, it drives the processes, and the systems enable."
20D,20D_41,A,"And I think that in boards gone past, they perhaps forgot that, and that’s why the cultures got very messy, and we’re now seeing the horrible position we’re seeing in some of the most - what were trusted brands in Australia.  And so I’m saying, ‘Well, where was the diversity thinking and where was the duty of care’.  Because if they had’ve had a duty of care to their people, the culture would have been different."
20D,20D_42,Q,"And the duty of care to their people, how - sorry, how is that part of diversity?"
20D,20D_43,A,"Well, because if you think about it, you have such a range of people in all these organisations.  You have to think about how broad your employee base is.  And I think that with all these corporates, when you really hone in on what are our jobs, that’s culture.  And so they say if you’re purpose-led with a good culture, you’re three-quarters of the way there."
20D,20D_44,Q,Because that brings - that’s the duty of care coming out.
20D,20D_45,A,"It is, it is."
20D,20D_46,Q,"Because you understand your consumer, your stakeholders."
20D,20D_47,A,"Exactly, and it’s the community, the broader community.  It’s the people.  So it’s not just employees.  You say it’s the employees, it’s your stakeholders, it’s your members, it’s your customers, and the broader community, and you keep drilling it down.  And that’s where I think diversity of thought encompasses a far better way of - rather than just concentrating on one element such as the shareholder.  You’ve missed the whole point.  And the culture will change.  We know that culture is king, we know this."
20D,20D_48,A,"And what we’re seeing in the press now, in my opinion, we’re seeing poor culture.  And if you look back on a lot of those boards, particularly traditionally, not more recently - we always home in on who’s sitting on the board today, but that’s not fair.  Some of them have just walked on those boards in the last year or two.  You have to look back at least a dozen, if not 20, years.  What was the culture in the board themselves.  And you’ll see, it was the same players in many cases.  There wasn’t diversity.  You’ve thrown diversity in the last year and they’re copping it.  No, culture’s not built overnight."
20D,20D_49,A,"And so that’s why I think that now we’ve got this really good understanding and we’re getting the evidence to say, “Let’s look a little bit further back of what that culture was on the board and was that reflective of the company as well”."
20D,20D_5,A,Yes.
20D,20D_50,Q,"So can we go to the skill matrix you were talking about, the modern one.  What’s the current one?  How does it differ to, say, one that was used 10 years ago?"
20D,20D_51,A,"Well, sometimes they didn’t exist 10 years ago.  It was more aligned to what are the functions of the business, rather than, ‘What are our duties as a consumer or as a global participant in the world’.  And I think what I’m seeing now is we’re far more aware of not what’s in our sphere as this industry.  So in superannuation - and I don’t want this to be the example, but if you were to think of a bank, do you just put bankers on the board?  So any financial institution, do you just put experts on?  No.  We’ve got to get away from that, and that’s what they used to do.  And even on health boards, I saw it too often."
20D,20D_52,A,"So now what we’re saying is, “No, because we’re part of a far bigger stratosphere, we have to think about what’s affecting us and what’s disrupting us and what’s coming at us;  who are our stakeholders, who are our people, what is our culture, and where’s our place in the community”.  And this is the more global thing I think that’s coming now, and so you want people who are broad thinkers as well as experts."
20D,20D_53,Q,And so the matrix will measure those kinds of dimensions?
20D,20D_54,A,"And so the matrix is starting to do that.  So now we’re saying, “What is coming at us”, and I still hadn’t seen it to this extent.  I would love us to think futuristic and say, broader, “Where do we want to develop for the next” - we want to drive the global picture in 30 years.  They’re the ones I’m not seeing yet on a matrix.  We tend to look more current and align it to our next year or two strategy.  Still a bit too immediate for me, and I think when we get braver, boards will start to say, “Well, let’s think like a futurist”."
20D,20D_55,Q,"And have one on the board, maybe.  Or think that way."
20D,20D_56,A,Yes.
20D,20D_57,Q,Or planning day.
20D,20D_58,A,"Or on a strategy day, bring in the futurist.  Because I think everybody just waits for things to hit them, but the really brave companies are the ones who are young and free, almost, without these heavy boards and who are out there, saying, “I’m going to create the future”.  And that’s where a lot of the corporates I’d love to see - and the public hospitals, et cetera -get to.  Think beyond that three-year plan."
20D,20D_59,Q,"So you’ve explained why you see board diversity as so important, so we’ll move to do you think that there’s any situational context where it’s not important?"
20D,20D_6,Q,What are they?
20D,20D_60,A,"No.  Sorry, impossible."
20D,20D_61,Q,"Some people have said to me it is exactly in situations of high uncertainty and risk - because I said, for example, that, and they said that’s exactly when you need diversity."
20D,20D_62,A,"Absolutely.  This current world, there’s no room for it.  Just no room for it."
20D,20D_63,Q,You’re sounding like the start-ups.  I’ve interviewed some directors from start-ups.
20D,20D_64,A,"Oh, really?"
20D,20D_65,Q,And you have an energy like theirs.
20D,20D_66,A,"Oh, they love board work.  It’s something that I would love to develop more.  Because I’m now placed where I really get it and I’ve learnt.  Twelve years ago, would I have fought like this?  No."
20D,20D_67,Q,"So now, let’s sit back, what does board diversity mean to you?"
20D,20D_68,A,"Diversity of thought;  a very well thought-out and constantly reviewed - like, annually reviewed - broader global picture;  having the right people at the table to help us navigate and also plan.  So it’s having that broad thinking for immediate, but also for beyond the immediate.  It has to have a lot of different skills, in my opinion, and the diversity has to be not just gender;  it has to be gender of thinking.  And that’ll come from - depending on what the board is, what it’s stewarding -what the needs are."
20D,20D_69,A,"So I always go back, “Who’s your customer”.  And if your customer is only women, I still wouldn’t have a board with only women, but I’d want people to think about our customer and challenge that.  So if our customer is a very diverse racial group, I would absolutely insist that we, anyway, look at that as critical that we don’t try to all represent but think even more laterally.  So what is our customer, or our member, or our stakeholder, or the broader community and how are we balancing that."
20D,20D_7,A,"Well, currently I’m on one board, which is a public hospital board.  It’s called Tweddle;  it’s a Vic Government-owned public hospital."
20D,20D_70,Q,"You said, “Gender of thinking”.  What do you mean by that?"
20D,20D_71,A,"Sorry, what did I say?"
20D,20D_72,Q,Gender of thinking?
20D,20D_73,A,"Diversity of thinking, which is - the different genders think differently.  What I’m saying is that the gender of thinking, for me, is about how do different gender - and not just male/female, but also LGTBI, that whole - how do people relate, how do we relate.  So it’s not just, ‘You’re a male, I’m a female, we’ve done it’."
20D,20D_74,Q,"And social networks that people have, is that important?  Is that part of diversity?"
20D,20D_75,A,"Now, that’s a really good question.  On health boards, that’s quite a critical one.  Why I say that is because we’re always trying to advocate, and they’re always competing with other areas for budgets and for philanthropic funding.  For both NFP and many industries, your social network is critical, so they will actually choose in many cases."
20D,20D_76,A,"But I’m going to draw the line there and say I’ve also known of boards - which I haven’t been on but I’m very aware of them in a competing space - who only put people on because of their social networks.  And it’s because of that philanthropic network that they’re being asked to go on, but doesn’t necessarily mean they have director skills.  And so that’s often been the traditional case."
20D,20D_77,A,"And I didn’t know if this would come up, but off the record, I really believe this has been part of the problem.  Do we think of diverse thinking, or do we - in many cases, if you look at boards, the people on there have deep pockets, and so they’ll help drive that funding.  And that might be essential.  But often that’ll be part of the thinking, and I’ve often found there was an old school of very wealthy people who are being invited to boards because of their social standing, in their words."
20D,20D_78,Q,And their economic standing.
20D,20D_79,A,Exactly.
20D,20D_8,Q,And you’ve been on other boards?
20D,20D_80,Q,"So that has a place, but it can’t replace -"
20D,20D_81,A,"Well, it can have a place in some very competitive environments and philanthropic-related areas.  But should they be on a board?  My question is, ‘Or should they be on’ - and this is what we did on one of our boards, we recognised they weren’t the board members.  Their thinking weren’t the board thinking;  they were the foundation.  So sometimes I think this where we’ve got to get smarter with what defines a good director.  Deep pockets can’t be a criteria for most boards.  It’s got to be a little bit better than that.  Do they have the discipline, do they have the training, do they have experience.  Maybe you put one invitee on there for the skills matrix because they think differently, because they do think differently.  But is that right?"
20D,20D_82,A,"So that’s where I think there was a lot of these social networks that were protecting each other, putting each other on boards.  And that had to change as well, and I think that one - now we know to use your committees for that, or your advisories, or your foundation.  And I’ve seen that move."
20D,20D_83,Q,"I want to just qualify here, you said, “I don’t want this to be used as an example”.  What -"
20D,20D_84,A,Only from my boards.  Specifically from my boards.
20D,20D_85,Q,But we can use the bank -
20D,20D_86,A,"Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, absolutely.  But not specifically from the board I’ve been on."
20D,20D_87,Q,"No, no.  Good.  Does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others?  Or do you see them as all reducible to different thinking?"
20D,20D_88,A,"No, I don’t.  I think that some are more critical, and I think I’m going to go back to where you’re placed in the broader community.  The community - let’s just say - I know it’s not quite, but if it’s 50% male and female, well, clearly that’s going to be a huge criteria.  If it’s racially, you have a lot of diverse ethnicity.  Maybe that will be important as well.  It’s who are you serving, and who do you want to serve, and who is the community that you’re impacting."
20D,20D_89,Q,"Now, you mentioned earlier that we’re all part of a global community.  How do you fit that in?"
20D,20D_9,A,"Absolutely, so I’ve been on other health boards.  I’ve been on boards for roughly about 12 years.  Health boards, and an accounting board, and I have had a lot of committee work as well, with finance and risk committees attached to boards."
20D,20D_90,A,"Well, I think there’s very few industries now that aren’t able to be either disrupted or in part that innovation isn’t impacting.  Be it because of online, be it because of fraud;  think really broadly.  Be it because of competitiveness.  The globe has really shrunk now that we can move goods within days, we don’t have to physically go places.  So because of accessibility, I believe we’ve always got to look globally for most things."
20D,20D_91,A,"Now, for something like a hospital where your patients are your district, it’s still about accessibility, and what we’re seeing is people are moving more to tele practice.  So even a hospital you think that is in - let’s just say Barwon, you say that’s your community, but it’s not because you can actually do things online now that you never could before.  So you’re no longer all working in these tiny geographics.  So globally, if somebody in China can tele practice as good as you, is that now your competitor?  And that’s why I say we’re all part of a global community."
20D,20D_92,Q,"Because I was thinking, Chinese medicine, we can all just opt out of -"
20D,20D_93,A,Look at what’s happening with dentistry.  People are literally going to Malaysia.
20D,20D_94,Q,It’s cheaper.
20D,20D_95,A,"Yeah, so who would have thought that five years ago or 10 years ago?"
20D,20D_96,Q,I know.
20D,20D_97,A,"So dentists now, some of their competitors are literally - they’re actually flying there because it’s cheaper;  it’s not even online.  So I just think that the world has shrunk a little bit more.  Now, there will be exceptions.  Please understand, I know there’ll always be exceptions.  But I think that if you can do health for something like a hospital with a specialist skill - and Cochlear is a fabulous example of this.  The Chinese are absolutely competing against Cochlear now.  And we had the market completely -"
20D,20D_98,Q,Absolutely cornered.
20D,20D_99,A,Absolutely.
21D,21D_1,Q,"Just let me check.  21D, I think I need a consent form from you.  Is that -"
21D,21D_10,A,So have a look and let me know and I can resend it to you if you -
21D,21D_100,A,"Yeah well I won't name names but I had a situation some years ago where we needed to replace or appoint a person to the CEO position in a particular business.  Fundamentally that business was involved in women’s fashion.  I had a pretty strong view that the CEO should be a woman and the owners of the business didn't share that view Margot.  So that caused some debate, ultimately they got their way because they owned the business but that was – there was some conflict on the board around that situation."
21D,21D_101,Q,"Okay so did the resolution, if you could call it that, or the decision outcome, was that really made because of the power of the, let's say the – because they owned the business, their ultimate power to make that decision?  Did they resort to power tactics?  Do you know what I mean?  Was that why that decision finally came down on the side of not appointing a female CEO?  Or was there more discussion and agreement in the end?"
21D,21D_102,A,"Well it was ultimately agreed that they own the business and it's their money, but yeah there was a number of – there were discussions with various other members of the board.  And ultimately it never came to a vote because ultimately they own the business so that's fine.  But there was a minority of us that felt it was pretty important for the staff and the business and the perception of the business for a female to be appointed.  The owners had a view and to say that no, we actually – we rate some of the other criteria other than diversity over a female.  We rate some other criteria rather more highly than that and that's what we want to do, so we had some good discussions about whether that was the right way to rate things but ultimately they had their way Margot."
21D,21D_103,Q,Was the chair one of the owners?
21D,21D_104,A,Yes.
21D,21D_105,Q,"Okay so what role did the chair then play in that?  How did they manage the division in the group, in the board?"
21D,21D_106,A,"Well I think they were respectful.  Everyone was invited to give their view and it was – early on it was pretty apparent that everyone wasn’t going to necessarily be aligned on that so there was another month passed, we all had some conversations outside and to various people and within the board.  And the chair certainly did some work, had some conversations with members of the board themselves around this.  We all sat back together and I think largely the positions were unchanged and respectful conversations and so on with the decision ultimately made Margot.  So the chair did the right things but there was no doubt there was conflict, as there sometimes is on – conflict is a strong word but robust debate and different views which ultimately weren't reconciled."
21D,21D_107,Q,"Yeah so did everyone, like no one left the board, everyone felt respected you said was it?  Respected you said, they were respectful?"
21D,21D_108,A,"Yeah I think everyone felt respected for their views, there wasn't any fall out.  People weren’t being fired from the board.  It was respectful."
21D,21D_109,Q,"That's a really good example, thank you so much because actually getting a feel for how values, different values, different beliefs, different priorities, when they can't be reduced to a point, there is just a difference and one wins, one doesn't, how that's managed by the board in a way that's functional for the board.  And the role of the chair in that is really important so thank you so much, that was a really clear story for us to look at."
21D,21D_11,Q,"I'll find it, I'm really sorry about that."
21D,21D_110,A,Well I hope that's useful.
21D,21D_111,Q,"Yeah it will be, you'll be surprised how useful those things can be.  So look, there's a lot of talk about this term cognitive diversity, but you can think about it as different approaches to problem solving, which you sort of alluded to at the beginning.  So do you feel that cognitive diversity influences your board’s functioning, whichever one you want to think about, all of them, some of them?"
21D,21D_112,A,"Does it?  Yes, it does absolutely."
21D,21D_113,Q,And we've got here is this a positive or negative?
21D,21D_114,A,Well I think it's positive.
21D,21D_115,Q,"Definitely, yeah.  And we've talked about why.  Do you want to – is there any difference, because of your spread across different kinds of board, is there any difference between those different kinds of boards, the not for profit, the private small and the private big?"
21D,21D_116,A,"Yeah there is a difference, there are differences, and it's because of I suspect large – well I guess they have, particularly not for profits have some different objectives.  It's fundamentally around service delivery and not [inaudible] 00:36:13 loss whereas the other boards I'm on are much more about financial outcomes Margot.  So and the ones where they're not for profit really I would argue there's more cognitive diversity on those boards.  [Inaudible] 00:36:32 the private boards are run by some extremely intelligent people, but they're much more – I mentioned similar corporate backgrounds, they'll have some different skill sets but really focused on capitalistic behaviour.  The other boards are – the not for profit boards, there's a bigger spread of talent and broader spread of talent, possibly maybe not as deep a talent as on the other one."
21D,21D_117,Q,"I interviewed someone, they were from a start up, in a start up sort of situation, and only one, so only one person has said this and I've interviewed a few start ups.  And they talked about in the context of the private for profit, private profit orientated, the power and influence of the sources of capital in shaping, influencing board decisions.  Does that connect with you?"
21D,21D_118,A,"Sorry, the power of what sort of capital?"
21D,21D_119,Q,"The sources of capital, so for example -"
21D,21D_12,A,"No, no problem."
21D,21D_120,A,Oh yeah.
21D,21D_121,Q,-@ private equity.
21D,21D_122,A,That's clearly enormous.
21D,21D_123,Q,Okay so you've got corporate backgrounds dominating that private for profit sector -
21D,21D_124,A,Yes they do.
21D,21D_125,Q,"- and you've also got the influence of private equity sources of capital, private equity, is that right?"
21D,21D_126,A,"That's correct, yeah."
21D,21D_127,Q,"So how – can you talk to me a little, tell me a little bit about how the board in that for profit, private for profit sector manages the influence of the – so they've got their own goals for profit and they've got a strong corporate background, the members of the board, but then they've got the influence of this private equity organisation or institutions, whatever you want to – sources of capital.  Can you unpack that a little for me?"
21D,21D_128,A,"Well usually the founders of the business, the founders of the business use from idea to requiring capital to execute on their ideas, the start of sort of land.  And there's absolutely no way forward unless they can find that capital.  So hence responding to the goals of the people that derive in capital is vitally important otherwise there is just no future.  In a more mature business, there are alternatives.  You might just not grow as quickly or you might not – I'd rather be more environmentally conscious and I'm happy to forego maybe some short term profit to do that or I might – perhaps one of the members of the family that owns the business is very strong on women having appropriate access to high levels of management and so on and hence they'll champion that sort of outcome."
21D,21D_129,A,"I think most people these days on boards say, “Yeah we absolutely see the value, we can see the value in diversity, we can see the value in being a good environmental contributor, we can see the value in perhaps having a voice on some more contentious things around worker’s rights, the rights of people for a fair days wage,” and all those sorts of things.  But the priority, how quickly those things are acted on and what sort of resources we put into those things on the short term, that's an area of debate.  And there's not a road map really, there's not a book that gives you guidance on that, it's different people will have different views."
21D,21D_13,Q,"21D, just a couple of demographics, you're discipline background?  What's your -"
21D,21D_130,Q,"That's interesting.  What I'm getting a sense of is that in this stage, with this start up stage, the early start up stage where we've got the idea and we're just trying to get to market, we're trying to get some capital for it, that the private equity company, they might be short term financial profit oriented priorities, that they can act almost like the imperatives, like the legal imperatives in the example you gave of trading while insolvent.  So it's almost like the diversity of a board and that richness of problem solving that can result, those benefits are almost lost in this situation or irrelevant because of this -"
21D,21D_131,A,"Yeah I think some of these benefits – I think yeah, there's an imperatives early on in – the imperative I chatted about earlier, that within – with a start up, the need for capital support, sadly, is pretty – extremely fundamental.  And as you grow and have a bit more options -"
21D,21D_132,Q,Autonomy.
21D,21D_133,A,"- autonomy develop, there is much more capacity to pursue some of these other attributes, which you could argue, and I think the great case to make, if you are able to do them anyway, maybe you should just be doing it because you won't get a better long term outcome.  But sadly, in the early days, businesses are managed for the short term rather than the long term.  I think some of the things that diversity brings are probably more long term optimised outcomes.  If you're not in that situation Margot, then you don't necessarily have the luxury of pursuing those goals."
21D,21D_134,Q,"Yeah it's a power relation, granted short term hopefully, but it's a power relation while you're in that stage."
21D,21D_135,A,"It's a short term lower value that I survive, which is – you just have a different horizon.  Well you're able to have a different horizon if that's another way of putting it.  It's a better horizon and a higher value horizon, but it's not actually – if that option is that available to you, then you can't pursue it."
21D,21D_136,Q,"No however just like in your earlier example of the insolvency, it doesn't mean that a diverse board is not useful, it's just for that particular stage, that particular decision, it was in there, that particular decision it was irrelevant.  And you've got boards here who tend to be corporate background dominant because they are in that phase where there is not real autonomy, the driver or the responsibility of the board is to meet the short term financial imperatives of the source of capital.  And then once there's more autonomy, then the board needs to become more diverse.  So it's sort of like a lifecycle."
21D,21D_137,A,"Well absolutely, you just don't have the luxury of pursuing diversity until you get to a certain scale and capacity.  It's just a bit like you're starting your own business selling lemonade at the front – well you won't have a nice diverse board to think about whether your lemonade is organically sourced and all the rest of it.  You just have that -"
21D,21D_138,Q,That luxury.
21D,21D_139,A,"It's not available to you, that option."
21D,21D_14,A,"I'm a chartered accountant, finance."
21D,21D_140,Q,"Okay that's great, thank you, that's really good.  Managing diversity, now we're moving toward the – we're 45 minutes in so we're nearly there.  When identifying potential new members, does your board consider ways to increase diversity?  You've explained that as an extension of the skills matrix so we'll move on.  Do people outside the board influence this selection process?  And you did say something about using recruitment organisations, is there anything else?  What about the – I know, with the start ups, because there's not – with the situation you were just talking about, the private equity situation, do they influence recruitment on the board?"
21D,21D_141,A,"Well they're usually sitting on – they'll have a couple of people from that private equity house on the board, so yes absolutely they'll influence that."
21D,21D_142,Q,Anything else like that in the not for profit or -
21D,21D_143,A,"Yeah well we're just doing that on another, about to look through new principals in the school I'm involved with.  So we're actually doing – we have a search consultant about to engage, but we're also seeking – we're doing a CareMonkey survey with the parents from the school to get some input from those – because what we ultimately want [inaudible] 00:46:55 because they inform the views of the board around well what are we really looking for here, including diversity and so on and we're getting some input from that.  And we want to be able to brief the search consultant as to well okay what do we think is important?  So they can bring back some people that look like – so we're trying to get soundings from [inaudible] 00:47:16 the obvious ones being the parents of the school, the alumni from the school, the senior executive team from the school, but also more broadly the staff."
21D,21D_144,Q,"Thank you.  21D, have you got any experience of having institutional investors on influencing your board decisions?  I mean like the major superannuation funds or something like that?"
21D,21D_145,A,No I'm afraid I don't Margot.
21D,21D_146,Q,"No that's okay, it just prompted me to think of them."
21D,21D_147,A,Yep sure.
21D,21D_148,Q,"Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process between, on the one hand, trying to obtain a good fit, a collegiate fit with your board, and on the other trying to avoid group think?"
21D,21D_149,A,Yes I do.
21D,21D_15,Q,"And boards, there's a lot of talk about board diversity and the focus of this research is to talk to people who are on Australian boards or from organisations that influence people who are on boards.  And so my  understanding is you're on a number of boards, or on a board?"
21D,21D_150,Q,How is that managed?
21D,21D_151,A,"Well I think that's – obviously the chair has a key role to play in that and I think a lot of that is around the right board culture Margot.  I think the constructive – what the board needs to have and the chair needs to create a constructive courteous challenging respectful environment.  And you need a process that also provides people the opportunity to get together and share ideas but also the opportunity – well yeah, individual thought as well."
21D,21D_152,Q,"Brilliant, okay, that's good.  And so then that, with that culture, then it sort of removes the tension between those two things, is that right?"
21D,21D_153,A,Yes [inaudible] 00:49:04.
21D,21D_154,Q,Yeah beautiful.  And so are you a chair or have you been a chair?
21D,21D_155,A,"I have been a chair on a number of them, yeah."
21D,21D_156,Q,How have you sought to build that right culture?
21D,21D_157,A,"Yeah well there's a range of – there's the whole I guess on-boarding, if that's the right – sort of it's in the induction, (a) do your homework to find suitable people to begin with, have the right criteria and values and so on, so it gets back to that values, that they want certain skills and we went certain values and certain behaviours as part of that matrix.  So it's trying to find the right people, induct them in a strong way in terms of well this is what we expect, this is how we'll behave, we want feedback, so setting up their understanding.  And then being pretty strong on encouraging – encourage all board members to contribute, encouraging people to give their best, being a good listener, being – not rushing through points even though you might think it's pretty obvious, take time to bring people along but also listen to alternative views.  As I say it's around communication, culture, respect, and good process I think."
21D,21D_158,Q,"Does the, what do you call it, it's like the legislative framework for the board, constitution, does that have anything to do with this?"
21D,21D_159,A,"Well not constitutions from my perspective.  But I think it's – on none of the boards I've been involved with, we haven't had a sort of written [inaudible] 00:51:16 the behaviour of the board that we expect, but I think there's a lot of literature and so on around about good functioning boards.  We try to do – all the ones I'm on we try to do annual reviews, so how we're performing, and get survey – each of the board members to contribute and improve et cetera, et cetera.  So behaviours are pretty well understood."
21D,21D_16,A,"I'm on two at the moment and I've been – I guess background really is I've been on – well I'm on two not for profits at the minute, but I've been on half a dozen private boards, ranging from a very large family group where I was actually [inaudible] 00:01:41 on the main board and on all the subsidiary boards, I was the director of the group.  So very large organisation and I've been on three boards involving private equity backed businesses, and then just another couple of privately owned businesses as well."
21D,21D_160,Q,Do the boards that you're familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity?  And how have you sought to overcome these barriers?
21D,21D_161,A,"Yeah well the barriers in – I think all the boards have barriers to do certain things Margot.  I think the private ones I'm on, they tend to be more compartmentally focused and they don't have – I guess the stakeholder groups ultimately in those sort of boards are more limited.  They're less concerned public perception.  Their activity is not really in the public domain, they're less concerned about what others may think of them.  Therefore to say, “Look we really need someone who's black,” which is not – that would be a good look, well they're saying, “Well that may well be the case but” -"
21D,21D_162,Q,At the moment it's not a priority.
21D,21D_163,A,"Not a priority, how does that change the bottom line for me?  It's just not [inaudible] 00:53:08 problem.  So I think – so there's that, the private ones have that sort of what's the driver for change?  Another situation I think would be school board, well it's hard to get people that don't have a – it's not a paid position so unless you have some sort of a relationship with the school or your children are there or you were there or whatever [inaudible] 00:53:31, why would someone come and contribute time, even though that would be very valuable for them to do that.  And I'm on a disability services board, the barrier there again, well it's not remunerated so how do you get someone?"
21D,21D_164,A,"Someone really needs to dive in and say, “Well I'll spend my charitable time, I like diversity.”  Or some [inaudible] 00:53:59 the guide dogs, and that could be a priority for them so how do you attract them in?  So I think more boards have barriers.  You can't just click your finger and say, “Well we'll get all these people in,” you have to find a way to attract them to the cause and that's not – any board will be ever, there will be barriers around that."
21D,21D_165,Q,"That's interesting, okay.  So we've got a supply of members, if there's lack of remuneration, and people have mentioned that before with the not for profits.  Do you think that the solution or a solution there is to actually ensure that there's remuneration for members?"
21D,21D_166,A,Oh that would be a solution.  I think that would be enormously helpful but it's just not -
21D,21D_167,Q,It's not feasible?
21D,21D_168,A,"It's not feasible for a lot of boards.  Yeah some people Margot don't like private boards because they know there will be these strong owners, or owners that are very fixed in their ways, and can I really make the difference?  Maybe I can't.  That's a barrier."
21D,21D_169,Q,"Yeah you described that in the example of conflict, yeah.  Do you think the use of targets or quotas to influence board diversity are useful?"
21D,21D_17,Q,"Great, you've got a lot of -"
21D,21D_170,A,Somewhat useful.  If you're going to a scale of one to 10 I might say three.  I think it's good to have a light on the hill directionally and I think targets are useful to keep the issue in the front of mind.  But I don't like quotas.
21D,21D_171,Q,What's the problem?
21D,21D_172,A,"Other than they flag the issue, because I just think look ultimately the person needs to be suitable.  And even if they are female Somalian and you say we need one of those, well ultimately if they don't have the time or they're not strong people or they're total unsuited – they're impatient or be those other attributes which might just mean well I'd rather actually miss my quota Margot, than have someone who ticks off these two items for me."
21D,21D_173,Q,"So your example, your illustration of the skills matrix extended to include diversity is what you’d like to see and targets will work with these but quotas are too prescriptive, is that the thing?"
21D,21D_174,A,"Yeah that's my view, that's it.  I think quotas are useful to keep – if we didn't have quotas or we didn't have – I think it's too wishy-washy to just say, “Oh we need to get more women on the board.”  Well we can keep saying that for the next 20 years, say well we want three women on the board by 2022, well that's – but that's good, but I'd rather miss my target than appoint the wrong person Margot."
21D,21D_175,Q,"Do you think that if you found someone when you were trying to recruit, and you found someone who just lacked some skills and experience but they would really contribute to the board you think well, and of a minority group, so maybe gender, would you as a board consider investing time and energy in cultivating the supply of that person?"
21D,21D_176,A,"I have done that sort of thing, would do and would do it again."
21D,21D_177,Q,What sort of thing do you do to cultivate a future board member?
21D,21D_178,A,"Usually it is around, into my area, usually it's around well we think they have the – they may not have the, perhaps the corporate skills that others have, and usually the board [inaudible] 00:58:18 plenty of that.  But they might have a set of values, they might be – I'll give you an example, I could say [inaudible] 00:58:25 around people and how people might be thinking and so on, but they've never sat on a board in their life, they don't know how to read a balance sheet Margot and they don't – well don't know board protocols.  How do we – do we vote now, that sort of thing.  I mean you're happy to invest time in those sorts of people because they bring a dimension that's not around the table and you can educate on those sorts of things.  It's much harder to educate a set of values."
21D,21D_179,Q,"Okay so you've got your values fit but – and they've got a useful skill but not all of them, so some of them – you'd have them on the board and you'd coach them while they're on there?"
21D,21D_18,A,"And one of them, sorry, one of the ones I was on a subsidiary board of Price Waterhouse Coopers as well, so one of their company subsidiary."
21D,21D_180,A,"That's correct and I've seen a number of people on boards where – I'm on a board with a doctor who's never had a corporate role before but offers a really – because there's a health dimension to what we're doing, to have the insight of well how would the patient be feeling or how did that affect the work, that's very valuable."
21D,21D_181,Q,"Okay great, that's good.  So finally, this is the final question, looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
21D,21D_182,A,"Well diverse Margot.  Boys club days, we're witnessing the dying days I suspect.  It will probably take 10 years but I think we've come some way and I guess it's pretty massive if you were sitting back in 1990 looking at what's happened now you'd say, “Well that's an enormous journey.”  You sit here now and you say, “I'm [inaudible] 01:00:10 dissatisfied with where we are.”  But 10 years, I think we keep the quotas and you'll get some generation – I'd like to think – it's a lot of pressure on I think the 60 year old white Anglo-Saxon men, but that will take a while to churn through the system and it is doing that.  So I think in 10 years time it will be rather different."
21D,21D_183,Q,"That's fantastic, thank you so much.  We're spot on, one hour, that's great."
21D,21D_184,A,"Oh yeah we are, well if we're missing questions I can give you another 10 minutes if that's useful."
21D,21D_185,Q,"That would be great.  I would like to just drill down a little on that last.  Do you think there needs to be any reform to help this change that you'd like to see in the next 10 years?  Can the government do anything?  Can institutions that shape boards like the ARCD, like women on boards, there's heaps of them, the investing bodies, the superannuation – there's an association for them and there's one for private equity."
21D,21D_186,A,"Yep.  I wouldn't say reforms, I mean I still think a [inaudible] 01:01:30.  I think the ARCD needs to keep the issues front of mind.  I think quotas, as I say, I think as a tool to keep the issue front of mind, I think that's very valuable.  I suspect – I think some directors have too many boards.  I think having a pretty good look at the more robust about well how much really can this one white Anglo-Saxon chap do?  I think that would be a fair question to ask.  I think there's a piece around board rotation probably, a bit like auditor rotation and so on.  I think that would be useful.  I think it might be useful to consider some sort of a – in the public domain, something that I think all the boards have it and I think we're starting to [inaudible] 01:02:39 some sort of diversity score card or metric or something like that might be worth considering."
21D,21D_187,Q,It sounds like you have the beginnings of it with your skills matrix extended -
21D,21D_188,A,"Probably [inaudible] 01:02:54.  I think people will be – I think there's a move really around good super funds and so on, the amount of power; they have now, I think there's a mood around well we can improve.  So it's a good time to start to think about those sorts of – best practice will be – those sort of things need to be mandated but I think encouraging best practice is where the sector could go Margot."
21D,21D_189,Q,"That's brilliant, so that's like industries leadership, industry leadership programs, recognitions and things like that, awards for -"
21D,21D_19,Q,"So it would be great, because you've got such a spread of board experience, compare, contrast with the questions, because some of them you might be able to say, “Oh yeah this happens here, but look in this situation I think blah, blah, blah,” so that would be great."
21D,21D_190,A,"Yeah that sort of thing, yes, I think that's useful and I think organisations like the ARCD and the super funds, they should really, really – not penalising people but sort of really encouraging best practice and they'll get more stories around all the benefits.  I guess you need those more pieces of research, just like what you're doing, just saying well look here, [inaudible] 01:04:05 there's a benefit here.  It's a bit like all things, it's a bit nebulous.  We all think it's right but the more you can draw out stories around, “Well hey, we never would have thought” – and I think there probably are plenty of stories from boards around well, “Gee, if we didn't have Mrs so-and-so on the board, we never would have thought about this issue.”  Well wasn't that valuable."
21D,21D_191,Q,"Exactly, I've had some really good examples of that.  The problem solving aspect seems to be really key in terms of benefits and that's a hard area to quantify because it's hard to -"
21D,21D_192,A,"Oh absolutely.  I assume though, on the sounds of it I think it is, but somehow we just need a new – need to grab hold of those examples and go, “Well look here it is.”"
21D,21D_193,Q,"Exactly, we don't need to quantify, this is qualitative research.  We can work with this, this is good.  So the other question before we go, someone yesterday mentioned tenure, and it was her view that tenure should be limited to six years on a board.  What do you think about that?"
21D,21D_194,A,"Well I don't know if six is the right number, but I think it should be limited."
21D,21D_195,Q,"How, to how many years would you suggest?  How would you come to limit it?"
21D,21D_196,A,"Well I wouldn't think it would be any longer than 10.  I mean the problem with six is, particularly for someone like the chair, there's a corporate knowledge and you build relationships and so on, you sort of have a – but 10 year, it's sort of saying you need to get on the board, okay maybe I'm there for a couple of years and I become the chair, I probably want to be chair for at least a few years otherwise it's all a bit rough.  And then you probably want the chair around maybe for a year or two after they're not the chair, just to help with the transition.  So six years, albeit that's a long time, it's, well from my perspective when you sort of think about what is ideal in a substantial and complicated organisation, that's not a long time.  But 10 years, more than 10 years you'd have to be looking at it and saying, “Well come on,” if you [inaudible] 01:06:33 the value that you might add over 10 years, you'd have to question whether it's ever coming I think."
21D,21D_197,Q,"Yeah that's great, thank you so much 21D.  It's been really interesting and really helpful."
21D,21D_198,A,"Thank you Margot, I hope there was some observations that are vaguely useful in that lot.  I hope it's been beneficial, as I said."
21D,21D_199,Q,"Oh I'm sure.  You've really helped to clarify some key points, it's been fabulous so thank you so much."
21D,21D_2,A,I sent one through to you Margot.
21D,21D_20,A,"Sure, yeah I'll try to relate back to those ones, albeit I must admit, I think back now and I think about diversity on those boards and [inaudible] 00:02:34 probably not that, I suspect not best practice on a few of them but anyway, we'll [inaudible] 00:02:39."
21D,21D_200,A,"Oh my pleasure, well good look with drawing together all the - I'm sure it's very wide and varied and -"
21D,21D_201,Q,Yeah well fortunately there's a good team.
21D,21D_202,A,- [inaudible] 01:07:13 and more verbose answers.
21D,21D_203,Q,Yeah well there's a good team working on it so we'll give it a good bash.
21D,21D_204,A,When are you looking to publish your document?
21D,21D_205,Q,"I think the team will – I don't know.  I don't know, we'll be analysing the data in July, August, so publication, probably there will be something not published.  It takes at least a year to publish something."
21D,21D_206,A,"Yeah that's what I thought, so I'm assuming there wouldn't be anything before the end of the year."
21D,21D_207,Q,"No but we might be able to – yeah, who knows.  As soon as we know you will be included in an email."
21D,21D_208,A,"That's all right Margot, don't – I'm [inaudible] 01:07:53."
21D,21D_209,Q,No rush.
21D,21D_21,Q,"But that's good, the contrast is great, yeah.  So for how many years have you been on boards?  How long does this go back?"
21D,21D_210,A,I'd rather the thing be robust than rushed out so that's understandable.
21D,21D_211,Q,Okay thanks so much 21D.
21D,21D_212,A,"Good on you, okay, have a good day Margot, nice to talk to you."
21D,21D_213,Q,"Yes thank you, bye, thanks."
21D,21D_22,A,"Oh I think – let me see.  Look I don't have that information sitting in front of me.  What would it be?  Probably from about 2005 or so, so maybe 15 years."
21D,21D_23,Q,"So that's been an exciting period, you've seen a lot of change since 2005 I presume."
21D,21D_24,A,"Well yeah, economy, yeah [inaudible] 00:03:09.  It seems like a long time ago now Margot, yeah."
21D,21D_25,Q,"So first, how have the composition of boards that you're familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?  Has it increased?"
21D,21D_26,A,"Sadly – the not for profits I'm on, they're quite diverse, they're pretty good.  But I must admit in the – my boards have been, the other boards have really been privately owned businesses and for the most part they've been pretty non diverse, pretty static.  So that would be I guess the headline comment Margot, so I haven't – I've sticked with – I mean the private states, I think some of the drivers that are perhaps impacting public companies and public – government owned corporations are not impacting that, my sector as much."
21D,21D_27,Q,Okay so what are these drivers that are affecting the not for profits that's not affecting your privately owned company?
21D,21D_28,A,"Well look I think it's the press and just greater discussion, particularly around the benefits of diversity on board and also particularly regarding women and people from different demographic backgrounds and so on, the not for profits I'm involved with really are aligned to that.  And the private are more focused on I guess business outcomes and reluctant – I wouldn't say they're not – I mean there's a good argument to say there are business outcomes from diversity but they're taking longer to change."
21D,21D_29,Q,"Good, that will be great to explore a little further as we move forward in the interview.  So first of all, just a quick idea, get an idea of how important you think board diversity is, 10 is extremely important and one is not important at all, what would you rate it?"
21D,21D_3,Q,Oh did you?  Okay.
21D,21D_30,A,Nine.
21D,21D_31,Q,"Nine, and so do you feel that it's always been important?  Has it always been important to you?"
21D,21D_32,A,"No.  No I think I've been one of the ones that probably not thought about it properly until perhaps the last 10 years, as I became more involved in boards and became more educated about some of the theory behind them and did the Institute of Company Directors course and become a bit more alive to some of the literature Margot.  You start, I guess I sort of understood more and identified more with the case of diversity. So I hadn't always felt – this hadn’t been alive to – I've been around, sadly I've been around a long time so I guess your thinking and understanding of things changes over time."
21D,21D_33,Q,"That's good.  So for you, the main drivers have been courses and literature that you've read, so that's a personal story."
21D,21D_34,A,"That's right.  So it's courses, literature, and I think just discussion in the media around benefits of diversity and shortcomings of lack of diversity Margot."
21D,21D_35,Q,"So there's been no organisations that have influenced you to do this, like any regulation, targets or quotas or – it's really been social media and your -"
21D,21D_36,A,"No, none of the regulatory piece or quotas or that sort of thing."
21D,21D_37,Q,"Just for my clarification, when you say privately owned, so we've got not for profits and privately owned, is this a listed company or is something that's not listed?"
21D,21D_38,A,"Not listed, so full profit, so large private – an example I was the executive director of a group called the Spotlight Group which owns 180 stores across the country, owns Anaconda, owns a lot of property as well.  It's owned by two families."
21D,21D_39,Q,So why do you think that board diversity is so important now?
21D,21D_4,A,"A week, 10 days ago or so, I can check to see what date."
21D,21D_40,A,"Yeah well I guess probably just a few reasons on that note.  I think ultimately it's around different skills and insights to problem solving coming from through having people with a diverse – with diverse values, backgrounds, educations, life experiences, et cetera, et cetera.  It's a better analysis and a better planning environment, rather than having a homogenous, Anglo-Saxon group of chaps who all went to private schools sitting around.  So I think it's better analysis, better solutions, from diversity."
21D,21D_41,Q,"So do you think that there's any situation or context that might cause you to change that rating, for example if there's a high uncertainty, high risk situation, do you think that the diversity is important then or not so?"
21D,21D_42,A,"Oh I do think it's probably even more important.  The only thing that could change my view might be if there was a particular need for speed on a particular matter.  That said, usually if there's a need for speed, getting a suboptimal can result.  So that yeah, I guess you need to be – sometimes you have to go for the suboptimal result because of timing.  But for that, that would be [inaudible] 00:09:45 situation, that would be the only construct I can think of where less diversity would be good, but probably not a great outcome."
21D,21D_43,Q,"So in that sort of – it's almost like a reactive decision mode is it, this speed you're talking about?"
21D,21D_44,A,Yeah correct.
21D,21D_45,Q,"Okay so in that reactive situation, the board functioning, how might it look?  You've got diversity, how would it look?  How would diversity get in the way of being able to react quickly to a situation?"
21D,21D_46,A,"Well I think with more diversity, there's just by definition a greater range of views to canvas, to consider.  There's more complexity in the analysis and the potential solutions Margot, and that just takes time.  I have no doubt it probably gives a better solution but sometimes, occasionally, I don't think it's so often, just things that are just so pressing that you may have to sacrifice that.  Or it might be appropriate to sacrifice that better decision, the less than perfect, but it's a reality."
21D,21D_47,Q,"Can you give me an example?  So it doesn't have to be – it can be just a plausible one, not an actual."
21D,21D_48,A,From the prospect of trading insolvently.
21D,21D_49,Q,"Oh okay, yeah."
21D,21D_5,Q,"Okay that's okay, I'll recheck.  I was away and so I'm -"
21D,21D_50,A,"Which it's obviously a major board consideration, a lot of directors become liable for the debts of the company if you are trading insolvently.  Well we can all sit around for a few days and work out whether we could and whether we could get out of it and so on, but there's pretty significant implications from that.  So as I say, yeah, I think it's rare but off the top of my head it would be a reason to perhaps – where a non diverse board might be able to get a – would get a better outcome first."
21D,21D_51,Q,"So I mean there's law there that guides that decision making.  So I guess if there is a clear legal directive, I mean I don't know if in the real world it is that clear, but is it a clear legal directive in that situation, there might be others as well.  I mean there might be other legal imperatives as well, then a diverse board becomes irrelevant or an interference, is that a principle do you think we can draw?"
21D,21D_52,A,"Is it a principle?  Well I guess the question was can I see sort of situations where a diverse board could be suboptimal?  [Inaudible] 00:13:02 I guess it's pretty rare constructs, fundamentally around – fundamentally it's around time.  I think the quality – if it's regarding quality of decision making, a diverse board is always better Margot.  There could be some legal constructs or perhaps, I don't know, the CEO – sexual misconduct or there's – or criminal activities or whatever it might be, those pretty extreme events, well there might be situations where you need to act very quickly and sort of engage in a – a full analysis from many perspectives is (a) not required, (b) time consuming."
21D,21D_53,Q,Yeah or it's deferred to an external body.
21D,21D_54,A,Yeah [inaudible] 00:13:54.
21D,21D_55,Q,"Yeah the analysis, okay.  So that's really good.  You're the first person who's been able to articulate that, and that sounds like a really important point for us to consider.  So that's great, thank you."
21D,21D_56,A,"Yeah I would like to think most – on a diverse board, it wouldn't be everyone would appreciate well, hello, we can all forget where we come from demographical or whatever, this is just a regulation or this is a huge issue, and frankly all the nuances are [inaudible] 00:14:28 issues.  But I can see a scenario where there's personal relationships or whatever there might be that might become problematic."
21D,21D_57,Q,"Right, but in terms of board functioning, I guess even these particular situations you've articulated, you can still have a diverse board but these decisions are really almost the board functioning becomes irrelevant, it's just a decision.  The board really has to call it, agree, or the chair calls a decision, right we're at risk of trading and being insolvent, we don't want trade, so we need to stop business and whatever you do, have it all -"
21D,21D_58,A,"Yeah [inaudible] 00:15:15 we need to get this [inaudible] 00:15:18, so that's the sort of [inaudible] 00:15:20."
21D,21D_59,Q,Yeah so is that really a situation where the chair – see I really don't know how this works.  So is it a situation where the -
21D,21D_6,A,"That's all right, maybe it's in your spam box or -"
21D,21D_60,A,"Yeah well that is a situation where you'd like to think the chair would say, “Well hello, we all respect each other, we all have a view, but this is just what” -"
21D,21D_61,Q,What we have to do.
21D,21D_62,A,"This is what we have to do, we don't have time to sort of really – it is just required.  Or we think the CEO has done something inappropriate with a staff member and he needs to be suspended immediately.  Some might have an alternative view on that, well don't really have time, we need to act et cetera.  So yes, you'd like to think the chair and the directors would all be very unanimous on that; I guess there is a scenario where that may not be the case Margot."
21D,21D_63,Q,"Yeah okay that's great.  So that's not against the idea of being a diverse board, that's really about the board – we could construct that as really about there are particular decisions that sometimes it's not democratic, it is an imperative, and it's managed differently to every day board business."
21D,21D_64,A,"Absolutely, they're pretty unique, almost like crisis type -"
21D,21D_65,Q,"Yeah.  So are there any less extreme – so that sort of imperative, that one must act on.  Are there any other situations where you think the functioning of the board around, with diverse voices and drawing all those voices together, so the functions of bringing that diversity together gets in the way of board functioning do you think?  Is there any other kind of -"
21D,21D_66,A,"No, no known situations.  It's – no, I don't see any other situations."
21D,21D_67,Q,"Yep beautiful, that's great.  Now let's move back, sit back and think what does board diversity actually mean?  So how do you understand board diversity?  What's it meant to you?"
21D,21D_68,A,"Well I think to me, it's having a range of experienced values and perspectives around the board table Margot."
21D,21D_69,Q,What about gender?
21D,21D_7,Q,"Yeah exactly, I was away so it was probably while I was away.  Yep that's okay."
21D,21D_70,A,"Oh yeah so I guess from that perspective, so I guess the female or – the female [inaudible] 00:18:18 male, so you're having the female, which I see as very valuable, around the board table.  I don't pretend to be a psychologist and there's different – males think different – some males think differently to other males and some females think differently to other females, but I think having a female voice, a strong female voice sitting around the table, I think it goes – there's much bigger diversity, much bigger with gender, and various other verticals, with age is an obvious one.  I guess religion probably less so these days but probably values and ethics, or values.  Some people are very interested in money, some people are very interested in environment, some people are very interested in technology.  So some people are very interested in people and their growth.  So I what are the main diversities needed?  Well gender, age, religion, skill set, geography, industry."
21D,21D_71,Q,Would you want people from different industries on your board or do you think a focus on the industry that you're board’s stewarding or directing?
21D,21D_72,A,"Well I think for the most part people with an experience of the industry the company is involved in.  That said, there are interesting relevant industries which aren't necessarily directly involved in an industry, so the insight – like I've got a lot of background in retail but technology and media is very interesting for retailers at the minute, as an example."
21D,21D_73,Q,"What I'm interested in here, there's so many different facets, different types of diversity, how do you choose?  Are you going to have just one female, one person who's interested in - one person – like a spread, or is this a strategic decision?  And if so, how do you make that?  How do you decide what kinds of diversity you want on this board at this time?"
21D,21D_74,A,"Well I guess my views on that, and I've done it on a few boards where we've had these sort of conversations, yeah we just – I guess we extend out a sort of skills and experience matrix, which you would normally do for a board, that's the old way of doing board selection, and you extend it across to the diversity lens Margot.  So you start saying, “Well female,” and then you say, “Okay well youths,” and you say, “China,” if that's relevant or, “Environmental,” or – when I was on a medical board we felt we needed a doctor probably with experience in the sector, just the business people Margot.  So you just extend out that skill matrix to more of a diversity lens and look at what you're looking at.  I don't think it's simply just a head count matter.  You might have four females on the board but if they're all shrinking violets, then you might in fact be better with just one who's much more robust in terms of their nature.  So I don't think it's an arithmetical exercise, it's more nuance than that."
21D,21D_75,Q,"So with the skills matrix, some of those can be quantified, but the shrinking violet versus the – these sort of personal, these characteristics, how do you assess those?  And is it something you do within the board or is it something that you outsource?"
21D,21D_76,A,"It can be either.  It depends on the situation.  I think search consultants are quite used to dealing with a range of very tangible KPIs they're looking for in a search and in tangibles as well, in tangibles of being well how vocal is this person, how compelling are they, what sort of presence do they have, are they likely to be influential or not?  And you can talk to people, gauge their experience, get references, et cetera, around those sorts of things."
21D,21D_77,Q,"So for me, what I'm getting, because this is sort of a bit of a challenge for modelling, understanding diversity and how it functions.  One point you've got is likely to be influential, so there's no point having anyone on the board if they're not likely to be influential, so that's essential, would that be right?"
21D,21D_78,A,"Agreed, correct."
21D,21D_79,Q,"Okay and the other would be to improve or to enhance problem solving, so it's to ensure that problem solving is deep and you've got, what is it, the skills and insights so that problem solving analysis and planning is optimised.  So would they be the sort of two guiding things you're looking for or is there something else?"
21D,21D_8,A,The 6th of June I sent that to you.
21D,21D_80,A,No I think that's a good summary Margot.
21D,21D_81,Q,Okay good.
21D,21D_82,A,"Perhaps the only element, I mean and it's obviously with the person who's motivated to be involved with the board.  I suppose that's just a given but people might have all the talent and capability in the world, but if they're otherwise distracted or disinterested, then they won't execute on what they could contribute."
21D,21D_83,Q,"Gender diversity has been debated for a while, how do you feel about the recent inclusion of ethnicity, sexuality, as part of the board diversity debate?"
21D,21D_84,A,"I think it's very valid.  I mean that's a better – again, I'm – well sadly I guess I didn't – I'm disappointed I didn't think of it first but it's very valid.  It's valid."
21D,21D_85,Q,Good and is there a particular kind of diversity that you think matters more than others?
21D,21D_86,A,"No I don't think so.  I think just a bunch of these, maybe the male female ones would be the obvious, the straightforward one.  But I don't think – yeah I'm on a school board, a private school, and having a youth voice is probably more important than gender diversity, now it happens that we happen to have gender diversity as well on our board but that youth voice I think is at least as important as gender diversity in that particular instance."
21D,21D_87,Q,So it might depend on the situation or the context -
21D,21D_88,A,Correct.
21D,21D_89,Q,"- of the board?  Okay that's once again the filter you were sort of putting over it of the – because the skills matrix is linked to the board’s strategy analysis of its strategy and how it's going to get there, the people, what it needs on the board to get there.  My really -"
21D,21D_9,Q,Okay I'll check my emails.
21D,21D_90,A,"Oh it's a good summary, no I think it's [inaudible] 00:26:54 what we're trying to achieve.  Here we are, we're a company, what are we trying to achieve, we have a range of stakeholders, some of whom are interested in dividends and others are interested in our environmental impact and others who – employees and well okay, we had some goals, but we have a strategy to achieve those goals.  I don't know what part of that – well what do we need on the board to achieve what we're trying to – setting out to do."
21D,21D_91,Q,"Yeah and then you extended that skills matrix to include diversity elements and so that brings it all back to the strategic function of the board or the goals of the board.  Yeah okay so that's great.  You've got the real beginnings of a model there, that's fantastic."
21D,21D_92,A,I'm sure I'm not telling you [inaudible] 00:27:41.
21D,21D_93,Q,"No, no, you've got the info.  I certainly do not.  Okay so now we're going to focus on the functioning of the board.  We've done some of this, we've done that one.  So now I'd like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards, and if so, how so conflict can be managed.  Can you recall a decision where there was conflict?"
21D,21D_94,A,Yeah happy to talk about that Margot.
21D,21D_95,Q,So can you recall a decision that the board needed to make which involved some conflict and you felt that -
21D,21D_96,A,"Oh okay sorry [inaudible] 00:28:20 recall a decision.  Yeah there are numerous, numerous difficult decisions over [inaudible] 00:28:31, many, many on a number of fronts."
21D,21D_97,Q,"So maybe one that will help us to understand, it illustrates how diversity is part of conflict."
21D,21D_98,A,"Yeah I'm trying to think of one where diversity – yeah well I've been on one of my boards, we looked at discussion around replacing the CEO, which is a key role of the board.  And just framing what attributes we're looking for in a new CEO is one where yeah, different people – it's where they find they have different priorities Margot."
21D,21D_99,Q,"Yeah that would be – yeah.  I don't know, it really helps us if we can get a story because it's amazing how powerful a story is when you analyse it.  So if you can, without sort of -"
22D,22D_1,,"So thank you very much for agreeing to participate, and I have those information, the information you gave me.  I’ll fill that out later.  First, how do you feel – because you’ve been a member of, a director of a company for 11 years you said, is that right?"
22D,22D_10,A,Yes.
22D,22D_100,A,"Yes, really part of the risk mitigations.  Because if you sit on the board you are so cocooned in that meeting, actually what happened outside you actually don’t know but your responsibility is huge."
22D,22D_101,Q,The inclusivity extends to the staff and there needs to be an openness and a dialogue between the two.
22D,22D_102,A,"Yes, absolutely.  We have had diverse board because now the employees are of a diverse background, they feel confidence in expressing their point of views.  They will tell you more."
22D,22D_103,Q,It’s amazing how different information is still coming up.  It’s very good.  That means it’s worthwhile.  Do you think there’s any board function that diversity can limit or undermine?
22D,22D_104,A,Yes.
22D,22D_105,Q,What function might that be?
22D,22D_106,A,"Most probably is budgeting.  How you allocate the funds.  To do, to be fair.  I think there is a lot of evidence they will pour in all the money to what they are comfortable with.  If things are new or something is out of the comfort zone they don’t want to touch it.  But those are missed opportunities."
22D,22D_107,Q,Diversity is a problem because it won’t get funded because people are still not comfortable with it or things will be funded -
22D,22D_108,A,"I’ll put it the other way around.  If the board is a diverse board at the time the funding comes along if we’re talking about how to fund a certain number of projects, I always say the project which is English speaking will fund a lot more than other cultures projects, is what I’m trying to say.  Because it’s out of the comfort zone because they don’t know."
22D,22D_109,Q,"It’s like it won’t be known, it won’t be seen, so it won’t get funded, it won’t be thought about, it won’t be strategically – it’s an opportunity lost, as you said."
22D,22D_11,Q,Can I say – so you’re from an Asian background?
22D,22D_110,A,That’s right.
22D,22D_111,Q,That’s the different points of view and -
22D,22D_112,A,"Of course the board members need to keep on pushing, every board meeting keep on reminding them that this one is really good, this one is really good until you are sick and tired of it."
22D,22D_113,Q,Sounds like you are a lobbyist.
22D,22D_114,A,"They are learning.  Other board members are learning.  They didn’t see it as important as what they are comfortable with.  Which is understandable, it’s human nature.  Everyone, there’s comfort zone.  It’s important.  But being a board member we really should not put ourselves in that comfort zone.  Because we’re part of a board, boards are the leader, to lead the organisation to bigger and better things.  We should have the foresight.  And really need to explain and convince other board members the importance of thinking ahead."
22D,22D_115,Q,"Thinking ahead and also it seems you need to advocate for, when you’ve got diverse backgrounds on the board each person from their different background needs to advocate I guess, their background."
22D,22D_116,A,And also lead by example.  You have to work a lot harder to prove it works.
22D,22D_117,Q,But not in a way – could that therefore become a problem because you might have different people with their different pet allegiances advocating and creating conflict on the board?
22D,22D_118,A,"That means you need to look at, go back to your mission statement.  Time after time, if we’ve got some differences we just go back and look at the mission statement, look at strategy paper.  I think that is very important.  That’s why the strategy needs to be revised every year."
22D,22D_119,Q,"And this process of conflict, let’s call it, different points of view it could challenge the strategy because it might be seen as an opportunity lost or an injustice or something?"
22D,22D_12,A,Yes.
22D,22D_120,A,"Yes, absolutely."
22D,22D_121,Q,That is the best description I’ve had of the way this conflict can be creatively managed.
22D,22D_122,A,"I think conflict is good.  Different opinions.  We are not sitting ducks.  We shouldn’t have the same opinion, everyone.  Some chairs like that but I don’t think so.  Everyone is different.  But as long as when in time we have our debate, we can agree, or disagree, we go back to our mission statement, we go back to our strategies so that we will not lose sight of the big picture."
22D,22D_123,Q,"The reason for the – that’s great.  That’s really clear and helpful.  We’ll use that.  Now I’d like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict – we’ve done that.  There’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity in board functioning.  Do you feel that cognitive diversity influences your board’s functioning?  Have you heard this term, “cognitive diversity”?"
22D,22D_124,A,No.
22D,22D_125,Q,No.  It includes different approaches to problem solving and different perspectives or different information processing styles.  That kind of thing.
22D,22D_126,A,It depends on the chair.  We can always work around the chair’s style.  Once you’ve got that style if you want to perform at something you know what to do.
22D,22D_127,Q,"I had someone say it’s really important to have people – some people are outcomes, very outcomes focussed, and others are more process.  And it’s important to have both."
22D,22D_128,A,"Yes, I think so.  That is why for debating it’s important.  You can disagree, you can agree, everyone says their opinion, the reasons why, so that everyone understands."
22D,22D_129,Q,Do people outside the board – just revisiting the recruiting new board members is there anyone outside the board that influences this selection process?  The chair does.  Who else does?
22D,22D_13,Q,"I won’t be more specific.  So you’d want an Asian background – so maybe an Aboriginal background, European -"
22D,22D_130,A,For that I’m not sure because for all of what I see the chair is the one who makes all the -
22D,22D_131,Q,In your experience.
22D,22D_132,A,"Yes.  To select the appointment.  Of course, at the time they also ask some fellow board member to sit on the selection panel but ultimately it’s the chair -"
22D,22D_133,Q,It’s the chair.
22D,22D_134,A,Yes.  I never want to be a chair.
22D,22D_135,Q,You don’t want to?
22D,22D_136,A,No.
22D,22D_137,Q,I was going to ask -
22D,22D_138,A,I never want to be a chair.
22D,22D_139,Q,You’ve certainly critically reflected on the role.  Why don’t you want to be a chair?
22D,22D_14,A,"Because Australia is multicultural.  When you look at the percentage of the populations I think it should be correctly represented on boards.  From my old job when we look at the junior staff Asian was, got a very high number of staff.  But when we go to the leaders Asian actually diminish, their representation."
22D,22D_140,A,"For myself I haven’t got the foresight in, not visionary enough.  From process I’m pretty, I know.  I haven’t got the foresight for five to 10 years.  I really just cannot imagine, to bring the organisation forward.  But lots of people are very good and they can see in 10 years’ time what will happen.  I just haven’t got that.  If I’m not that visionary I shouldn’t be a chair.  I always think the chair should be very visionary.  Not only lead the organisation, they also lead the board."
22D,22D_141,Q,That’s a really good point.  And it makes sense.  I’ll keep that.
22D,22D_142,A,"So that’s why if the chair’s been there for say, 10 years I think, I always think six years is the max."
22D,22D_143,Q,To stay fresh?
22D,22D_144,A,"Yes.  Sometimes a chair can be there for 20 years and what other new ideas you have got, they should move on to another board."
22D,22D_145,Q,Do you think that needs to be in another industry or just another organisation?
22D,22D_146,A,"I would say a bit of both.  It’s good to have similar industry, especially those organisations who need help because they have done that, the experience can tell.  But a different industry that means you’ve got fresh eyes.  I would say a bit of both."
22D,22D_147,Q,"Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process between on the one hand trying to obtain someone who’s a good collegiate fit and then some, trying on the other hand to avoid group think?  Do you think there can be tension between those two – the chair might be thinking, I really want someone who’s a good collegiate fit but I also want someone who can bring in different points of view, different industry knowledge, different whatever, so that we don’t have group think?"
22D,22D_148,A,"I think it depends on the chair, whether they’re open minded or not.  If they’re open minded they’re quite happy to accept a challenge."
22D,22D_149,Q,Collegiate fit doesn’t matter you mean?
22D,22D_15,Q,"But how would we – because there’s a fixed number you can have on boards.  If we represented the Australia, the diversity of the Australian population proportionally on boards we’d have to have large boards wouldn’t we, because we have so many different cultures here in Australia.  So how do you see the role of cultural diversity playing out?  Do you know what I mean?"
22D,22D_150,A,"Yes, that’s right."
22D,22D_151,Q,If they want group think – they want to avoid group think?
22D,22D_152,A,That’s right.
22D,22D_153,Q,"So you think this is really, the chair determines that – it’s almost like a risk appetite."
22D,22D_154,A,That’s right.  What he is comfortable with.
22D,22D_155,Q,And do you think – have you worked on both kinds of boards?
22D,22D_156,A,"Yes, I have.  We just make sure we say the right things.  You can only try so many times to challenge him.  Once try, third time and then just shut up.  What can you do?"
22D,22D_157,Q,Do you have a preference yourself as a director being on a board that’s more open and -
22D,22D_158,A,"Absolutely.  More open.  I don’t want to have the group think.  More open, open for discussion, bring new ideas.  Because I also want to learn too.  If it’s group thinking everyone’s just sitting down, no one wants to learn.  It’s a waste of my time.  For me, I want to learn new things."
22D,22D_159,Q,So if you’re on this other kind of board that’s very inter-collegiate and no conflict you don’t learn as much?
22D,22D_16,A,"Yes, I do.  For example, at the moment is Asian century. I would say of course people other than, apart from European and Asian, and people from other countries are also important.  But when you look at the populations they haven’t got that higher percentage yet.  And for Australia they would do it, reaping the benefit to understand where Asian century. I think Asians should have more representatives sitting on boards, thinking how to connect with the customer, how to connect with the suppliers, the ways of life."
22D,22D_160,A,"Yes, and I say see you later.  I’m not interested."
22D,22D_161,Q,"So you won’t be extending your time there, you’d rather go somewhere where it’s more fun, more -"
22D,22D_162,A,"Yes, because it’s important for me to keep learning."
22D,22D_163,Q,You sound like these start-ups.  You’re wonderful.  It’s great.  Got the energy and fun.  Do the boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity?
22D,22D_164,A,"They say they don’t but actually still on that comfort zone and risk, actually they are.  That means we really need to work on both sides, the potential diversity, the potential for member of diversity background for another skill or culture, or capability.  They need to really to build up their skill, make themselves known.  And also for the board they need to be more open minded so that both party can meet together.  And both party need to work harder in order that they can meet."
22D,22D_165,A,"Otherwise if – once I say, wow, I’m so special, why did they select but they’re not prepared to do any work.  It will never happen.  That means you’ve still a big gap.  [Unclear] 0:39:02.7 and the board-side, they didn’t move, they’ve still got a big gap there.  So I think it’s both parties need to work harder, maybe need a lot of mentoring for the potentials for the members.  You also need lots of strategies, meeting, sell the benefit of a diverse board for the existing board members."
22D,22D_166,Q,And how might we work on these sides?  What do you think we could do here in Australia to try and build those two sides?
22D,22D_167,A,"I think the former Race Discrimination Commission, Doctor – what’s his - Dr. Tim Soutphommasane.  He just, he finished his five year term at – what’s his name?  I forgot.  I forgot his name.  But he did an excellent job.  He wrote some books talking about diversity on boards. He’s got a lot of papers on diversity on boards.  At the moment her – after a five year term and then he’s at the University of Sydney at the moment."
22D,22D_168,Q,I’ll look him up.
22D,22D_169,A,His is from Laos.
22D,22D_17,A,At the moment I find it’s misunderstood with Australians who think that it’s what Asians want but actually that’s not what Asians want.
22D,22D_170,Q,"Let’s go back to your, what I was understanding you’re talking about barriers.  We need to build capacity on the supply side, as in candidates, and a capacity on the board side that is like an inclusiveness."
22D,22D_171,A,"Yes, that’s right."
22D,22D_172,Q,Have you any ideas about how we might do that here in Australia?
22D,22D_173,A,"I would say the board members, they should be great mentors."
22D,22D_174,Q,Get the board members to be mentors?
22D,22D_175,A,"Mentor the potential up and coming, the people who wish to join the board."
22D,22D_176,Q,"I’ve interviewed people from the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  Do you mean that sort of thing, these organisations -"
22D,22D_177,A,"Yes, and the actual board member.  They should do that too if time permits it, but [unclear] 0:41:43.5."
22D,22D_178,Q,"Because they have members and then they have this place where members can go, and I presume it’s so as they can informally meet other directors and chairs and things.  So that kind of thing?"
22D,22D_179,A,"And I think for the existing board members if they want to help the next generation they really need to go all the way and mentor one or two, select one or two people they see their potential, and then they mentor them.  And then after they mentor them he or she become their sponsors."
22D,22D_18,Q,"You’re on Government owned boards and not-for-profit boards.  Do you think the BHPs, would it apply to them as well?"
22D,22D_180,Q,"What about – I notice there’s organisations that help people from refugee background and low socioeconomic background.  They might have, people from these backgrounds probably need a fair bit of mentoring to bring them into this space where they could go to the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  Do you think there’s a need for affirmative action to try and help people -"
22D,22D_181,A,"Obviously for, if you look at that [unclear] 0:43:07.6 for the foundation they did lots of work like that already."
22D,22D_182,Q,I notice they did some for schools and scholarships but -
22D,22D_183,A,"And also for the refugees, because for the mission is, education is important to make them get the skills to join the workforce."
22D,22D_184,Q,"I noticed that.  And then mentoring as well, they had people who were -"
22D,22D_185,A,"Yes, that’s right."
22D,22D_186,Q,They’re non-Government organisations investing in that kind of thing.  What else can we do?  How do you feel about the use of gender targets and quotas to influence board diversity?
22D,22D_187,A,"For me I – I would say we can use targets, not quotas.  If you’ve got the target if you can achieve it it’s good.  If you can’t you find out the reasons why.  I think that is, for me that is good enough.  If you’ve got a quota that means it’s really compulsory and then you will fall into the trap say, you just need to tick the numbers.  I prefer a target.  If you cannot achieve that target, why?  And find out what we can do so that next year we can achieve that target.  So whoever is appointed to the board they are not the one who just need to tick the box."
22D,22D_188,Q,And then there’s token.
22D,22D_189,A,That’s right.
22D,22D_19,A,"Absolutely.  BHP is a big organisation.  And then I still remember that the former chair [Don Argus] 0:04:31.1 to say, every morning they need to say thank you to China because customers.  But when you look at the board, they really understand what the customers need."
22D,22D_190,Q,"Although we’ve got – I was at the launch of the AICD 30 per cent target on Monday night last week and it was a disappointment that everyone thought we were going to get the 30 per cent and we fell just short of it.  It was very disappointing.  And then here we are we’ve got our Government, we have no female as the leader of the party or the deputy on either side.  And that’s the first time – so we seem to be going a little backwards."
22D,22D_191,A,Backwards.
22D,22D_192,Q,"I suppose we – the targets, do we need explanations?  Are explanations enough?  Is there something deeper?"
22D,22D_193,A,"The problem is that whoever makes decisions are men.  So the comfort zone – they want men.  Until the day that the men change, open mind, change their mindset we’re going to force them."
22D,22D_194,Q,So we need more female chairs.  I guess then if there is that inequity fundamentally within the people in the most power then targets and explanations won’t get around it because there’ll be rationalisations.
22D,22D_195,A,But do you think a quota will get around it?
22D,22D_196,Q,No.
22D,22D_197,A,No.
22D,22D_198,Q,You don’t think it will?  Why not?
22D,22D_199,A,"When you look at the saga for AMP, for the Royal Commission, when you look at all the list those are the, female directors, they’re all gone.  And you ask why?  They meet all the quota but they’ve become -"
22D,22D_2,A,"Yes, 11 years now."
22D,22D_20,Q,"Some people have mentioned in order to understand what customers need they have a sub-committee of the board.  Let’s say they were going, they’ve used this example like with BHP, they would be wanting to open, work with stakeholders in China.  They would get a sub-committee together with people who know that market, people from China or whatever, to inform them."
22D,22D_200,Q,The ones that have been knocked off their perches.
22D,22D_201,A,That’s right.
22D,22D_202,Q,The most vulnerable.
22D,22D_203,A,"There is something that’s missing.  I think being, I think for, talking about gender, for a woman, because we look after the house, the household we’ve got more important things to do than fight.  And haven’t got that energy to fight.  I think that is where, what we are missing.  If we have that full energy I’m sure we would be equal.  But actually we are not."
22D,22D_204,A,But when you look at the New Zealand Prime Minister she’s going well.
22D,22D_205,Q,"I know, she’s amazing.  Exactly.  She’s our beacon."
22D,22D_206,A,That’s right.  Maybe -
22D,22D_207,Q,It’s possible.
22D,22D_208,A,Yes.
22D,22D_209,Q,And she’s the younger generation.
22D,22D_21,Q,"But I asked do you think they should be on the board, and that wasn’t always a yes.  It was no, sub-committee.  So where do you draw that line?  A sub-committee -"
22D,22D_210,A,But do we need to wait for the next generation to be equal?  Maybe.
22D,22D_211,Q,Maybe.  This is your culture – you’ve talked about culture.  It keeps coming back and now we’re talking a very deep culture aren’t we?
22D,22D_212,A,Yes.
22D,22D_213,Q,The baby boomer has come up in other conversations by young people.
22D,22D_214,A,And I’m sure -
22D,22D_215,Q,[Overtalk] 0:49:19.5.
22D,22D_216,A,"- you’ve interviewed some – feedback.  Say that 29-year-old lady is her feedback, is she ambitious?"
22D,22D_217,Q,"She is ambitious but she had insight.  She was pulling back because she realised I’m not quite ready for some things.  So she was, she reminded me of, that reminded me a bit of what you were saying.  The 40-year-old cohort that I’ve interviewed there’s a more explicit concern about sustainability and environment and a concern that that has been mismanaged by the white-hair grey male."
22D,22D_218,Q,"And I was thinking yes, I think you’re right.  But anyway, this is the first time we’ve really touched on this deeper cultural problem, barrier to diversity, gender diversity.  But then possibly others, that inclusivity."
22D,22D_219,A,"A couple of years ago the Chinese community did, talking about bamboo ceiling."
22D,22D_22,A,I disagree with the committees because -
22D,22D_220,Q,"Really, in China as well as -"
22D,22D_221,A,"No, here."
22D,22D_222,Q,"Oh, here."
22D,22D_223,A,"Yes, talking about bamboo ceilings.  There was lots of conferences about bamboo ceilings."
22D,22D_224,Q,So this is Chinese not being able to move up?
22D,22D_225,A,"Yes, that’s right."
22D,22D_226,Q,"The Asians.  I’ve heard, is there an organisation associated with Melbourne Uni that is about trying to help people from Chinese background get on to boards or something like that?"
22D,22D_227,A,I’m not aware of that.
22D,22D_228,Q,"Someone told me at a conference but I need to research it.  There’s something at Melbourne Uni.  I’ll have to find out.  Do you think – we’ve got to that deep cultural level, which is sad, and it’s bamboo ceiling, glass ceiling.  Do you think it was worse five years ago than now?  Are we getting better?"
22D,22D_229,A,"No, I think it’s getting better.  It is for the next generation.  They realise they can do it and they are, instead of see themselves as the victim."
22D,22D_23,Q,Great.  Tell me.
22D,22D_230,Q,I’m going to be haunted by your comment “do we have to wait”.  Do you think we have to wait?
22D,22D_231,A,I think for the next couple of years the trend is not encouraging.
22D,22D_232,Q,If we had more female chairs do you think it would be different?
22D,22D_233,A,"It all depends on the chairs, whether the chair’s open minded or the chairs, they are, it took me so many years to be the chair I need to protect, I’m the queen bee, I need to protect my position.  I don’t want anyone really to get a free ride."
22D,22D_234,Q,You described it beautifully.  And you won’t be a chair.
22D,22D_235,A,"Yes, I don’t want to be a chair because I’m not visionary enough."
22D,22D_236,Q,Because of the visionary?
22D,22D_237,A,Yes.
22D,22D_238,Q,"Do you feel that regulation can help with, to improve this, to make it happen faster?"
22D,22D_239,A,But will there be regulations for that?  What law is it going to be under?
22D,22D_24,A,Because that means you are downgrading the importance of inclusion.  If they’re sitting on the same table they should have the same opinion instead of just third party information.
22D,22D_240,Q,"It doesn’t have to be direct.  It doesn’t have to be a direct.  It could be working on your two sides, the supply and the demand.  The board cultivating more inclusivity somehow.  That will be the future generation.  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  You’re the person who -"
22D,22D_241,A,"I think we are.  I’ve got hope on the future generations.  They’re ambitious, they’re articulate, they communicate well.  If they’ve been here – for me because I’m a migrant, first generation migrant it’s a lot more harder than them.  Say for my daughter, if you talk to her there’s no difference between talking to Aussie or not.  She understands the Aussie culture and people see her as an Australian instead of an Asian."
22D,22D_242,Q,So the future generation will be our solution.  No more regulation.
22D,22D_243,A,"Yes, regulation is a little bit hard because once you’ve got the regulation you’ve got a lot of people that say oh well, if I have to do it I will do it.  You have to earn that respect."
22D,22D_244,Q,"And finally, looking 10 years into the future, your favourite, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
22D,22D_245,A,"I hope it’s more diverse, more inclusive and when we walk down the board the positions will be exactly as what we walk past on the street."
22D,22D_246,Q,Perfect.
22D,22D_247,A,Because when you walk past Collins Street it’s not all white men.
22D,22D_248,Q,No.  It’s so diverse.
22D,22D_249,A,Yes.
22D,22D_25,Q,"This word “inclusion” has come up not with everyone, but has come as a really interesting thread in about four interviews and I’m very interested in it.  You’ve just mentioned it as like a power thing, symbolic power.  So you can’t just have people on a sub-committee because they don’t have the same power then."
22D,22D_250,Q,It’s so wonderful.
22D,22D_251,A,"Take a snapshot of that, that should be our board."
22D,22D_252,Q,"Perfect.  Do you think we can do anything – this is really going back to the same question – direct programs, maybe we could start them at school."
22D,22D_253,A,So in school teach them equality?
22D,22D_254,Q,"Equality, yes.  And also the importance of boards in society, maybe."
22D,22D_255,A,"Maybe, yes.  To co-ed or to boys school or girls school."
22D,22D_256,Q,Yes.  And have inclusive schools so you’re not – someone else raised that.  They think that the time’s gone for having segregated schools.  Do you agree with that?
22D,22D_257,A,"I think human beings, everyone is different.  Some girls thrive on being at a girls’ school.  Some boys are, some are co-ed – it all depends on the kids.  Give them choices."
22D,22D_258,Q,Just choice.  Have choice.
22D,22D_259,A,Yes.
22D,22D_26,A,Yes.
22D,22D_260,Q,"Good answer.  Inclusive.  Individuals such as leadership coaches, head hunters, do you think they have a role to play in this?"
22D,22D_261,A,"Coaches, yes.  Head hunters, I don’t know.  I never, in my whole career -"
22D,22D_262,Q,Never.
22D,22D_263,A,"- I never used any head hunters for my job.  Because people say, I never needed to put a CV together.  [Overtalk] 0:57:25.5."
22D,22D_264,Q,That’s wonderful.
22D,22D_265,A,"Maybe someone knows me and tell me [unclear] 0:57:30.7 yes, okay, I’ll go."
22D,22D_266,Q,You’re amazing.
22D,22D_267,A,I’m very lucky.  I must say I’m very lucky.
22D,22D_268,Q,You’re a good spokesperson.
22D,22D_269,A,"I’m very lucky.  I think the key word really is, being on a board, if that means the up and coming board members they need to have a sponsor.  I think it’s important.  And as I say I’m very lucky.  I’ve had lots of sponsors during my career."
22D,22D_27,Q,Can you talk more about this inclusion idea?
22D,22D_270,Q,"Well, you’re a good networker then."
22D,22D_271,A,"Yes.  Remember you need to give first.  Don’t ask, ask, ask.  If you want a bit of help you give first."
22D,22D_272,Q,Exactly.
22D,22D_273,A,You need to serve the community.
22D,22D_274,Q,And you will attract.
22D,22D_275,A,"Yes, that’s right.  You don’t need to ask for things.  Things will come to you automatically."
22D,22D_276,Q,That’s a really note to conclude on I think because [unclear] 0:58:38.4 –
22D,22D_28,A,"As the research has shown with the board, if you’ve got a more diverse board actually for the profit-wise they are a lot more profitable than they concentrating on gender balance or male dominated board.  If you’re looking at the businesses the benefit of having a diverse board has outweighed anyone who’s not prepared to do it."
22D,22D_29,A,"Of course, there will be some risk, it’s out of their comfort zone, it’s not something they know.  In Australia it’s who you know that’s important, who is your sponsor is so important.  If you are not in that club you’re out.  It’s so important.  But I’m saying I encourage people to look at their skillset and be maybe prepared to be a sponsor, be prepared to be a mentor to bring the next generations.  Because a lot of young people they are very ambitious, they would like to sit on the board and give."
22D,22D_3,Q,"Eleven years, yes.  For 11 years.  If you think back over that time how has the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed in terms of diversity over that time, 11 years?"
22D,22D_30,Q,We’d better go to how do you understand diversity?  What do you understand diversity to mean?
22D,22D_31,A,"Diversity is not only for the heritage.  Diversity, I would think diversity include a lot of things.  Different thinking, even people with special skills, even people with disability.  I think, as you mentioned inclusion is so important.  The board need to represent – it all depends on what sort of company it is – it should be representing all walks of life."
22D,22D_32,Q,So you say depending on the company.  What makes the difference?  How do you decide what kind of diversity is needed for what kind of company?
22D,22D_33,A,"If you are, for example, if your company is health related that means it all depends on what sort of health.  And then for your board of course you need some health expertise, you also need to have someone who understands the patients.  For health the outcome is important.  I think it all depends because every company structure is different.  The board should be formulated differently.  For example, if you’re a university you have all walks of life you need everyone.  But when you look at university are there skills representing the whole Australia?  Most probably they are not."
22D,22D_34,A,"Is anyone representing the students?  Most probably not.  I think that is, that is what we think what the students or the undergrads want but actually it may not be the case."
22D,22D_35,Q,That’s consistent with what many people have said is that you and the board analyses – it’s often using it’s skill mix thing in its strategy.  So you agree with that and then -
22D,22D_36,A,"And I think the most important at the moment on the board is still who you know.  I think we need to break that barrier.  We need to tap in outside of who you know to give people opportunities.  I’m fortunate enough to have a lot of opportunity maybe because of who I know and lots of people just haven’t got this opportunity.  Of course, this is both sides.  The potential up and coming board members they also need to work very hard, they also need to excel to do what they are good at, they always need to put their hands up, they also need to serve the community."
22D,22D_37,A,"I think that is where the mentoring comes into it.  For them if they ever want to be a non-executive director but they don’t know how.  But the first question I ask, have you given back to the community yet?  Are you prepared to do it for free?  Not only the money-wise, the time.  And a lot of people back off.  They thought non-executive director is good pay, couple of meetings, is easy life.  But if you take it seriously it’s not.  You need to spend lots of time understanding the culture and know the staff, and then communicate with the fellow board members.  Put your hands up, always ask questions."
22D,22D_38,Q,How important do you think it is to have a diverse board?  Let’s say 10 is extremely important and one is not important at all.
22D,22D_39,A,"I would say 10, definitely.  I think lots of companies for their sales, the outcome is not what they expected.  Maybe they haven’t utilised the board members to the maximum.  They really haven’t [unclear] 0:11:48.3 for the board member’s skills, what they can bring to the board. At lots of board meetings they become a management meeting.  The management just keep on reporting, reporting, and reporting and then approving things.  So I say hang on, what are the strategies?  We’re thinking about five years down the track, 10 years down the track."
22D,22D_4,A,Changed gradually.
22D,22D_40,Q,Do you feel that it’s always been important?
22D,22D_41,A,Yes.
22D,22D_42,Q,"So it’s always been thought to be important, diversity?"
22D,22D_43,A,Yes.
22D,22D_44,Q,"Do you think that there is any situation or context that might cause you to change the importance rating you give?  For example, high uncertainty, high risk situations?"
22D,22D_45,A,"No, I don’t think so.  In this world we need to know how to manage the risk.  Risk is everywhere.  Risk is everyone’s business."
22D,22D_46,Q,"A diverse board then, you think that they make better decisions, is that it, better -"
22D,22D_47,A,"Yes.  If the chair listens to what the board member can contribute, it all depends on the characteristics of the chair.  Some chairs are very accommodating, some chairs are very dominant, some chairs – I’m very lucky for all the boards I sit on that the chair actually, they are very accommodating, they listen, they listen to all the opinions.  And they make a decision, make the lead."
22D,22D_48,Q,"This has come up before that the chair is really important.  And you’ve talked about inclusion as well, and culture.  Are all these things, culture of the board, inclusivity, and the chair, are they all linked?"
22D,22D_49,A,Absolutely.
22D,22D_5,Q,Gradually.
22D,22D_50,Q,"Can you give me a story, an example, so we can unpack that, understand that?"
22D,22D_51,A,"For example, one of the boards I sit on what they wanted originally, because of Asian [unclear] 0:14:26.4 the chair felt they really needed to have some sort of diverse directors or advisors on-board so that they understand, he will understand what his business will be in five to 10 years’ time.  What he has done is bring some board members with diverse culture, not only Asian, some from some other countries too, some from other skillsets, some from disabilities, special needs so that he can get an informed choice.  I think it’s really important to help his thinking.  Is he on the right track.  And that is – which I admired.  For him he doesn’t need to do that because he’s so smart he can do everything himself.  But he’s still very, he listened to what everyone was saying and then he make that informed decision and then he explained the reasons why.  I think it’s very good."
22D,22D_52,Q,This is to the board?  This is the chair -
22D,22D_53,A,"Yes, that’s the chair."
22D,22D_54,Q,So having this diversity on the board rather than having as a sub-committee because that’s too token?
22D,22D_55,A,"Yes, because for him because he’s very forward thinking he asked for the diversity of the board because what he knows himself is not diverse enough."
22D,22D_56,Q,"Brilliant.  Let’s move to board selection, because that’s what you’re talking about.  How did he try to increase, what did he do to increase the diversity of the board?"
22D,22D_57,A,"Of course, he would ask around and then, ask around for recommendations and then he checked, double checked, and then made acquaintance with potentials for – it’s not a three month journey, for him it’s 12 months to 18 months – so that he will feel comfortable with the potential directors.  And then he makes the appointment.  He was very, very careful in the selections."
22D,22D_58,Q,Didn’t employee a recruiting company or anything like that?
22D,22D_59,A,Funny you say that.  All the boards I sit on all are tap on the shoulder.
22D,22D_6,A,"And slowly.  It’s not quick enough.  Because the majority of the board composition still compiles of, dominated by male.  And now we’ve got a little more gender balance but I’m looking for more diverse background, directors which will give a diverse point of view which is important."
22D,22D_60,Q,Interesting.
22D,22D_61,A,I never needed to apply for any board position.  And I got so many phone calls wanting me to join their board.
22D,22D_62,Q,Is this from head hunters or is this from chairs?
22D,22D_63,A,From chairs.
22D,22D_64,Q,From the chairs of boards?
22D,22D_65,A,"All the boards I sit on I got a call, or tap on the shoulder from the chair.  And I never applied for any -"
22D,22D_66,Q,Any of them.
22D,22D_67,A,Any of them.
22D,22D_68,Q,"That’s great, isn’t it."
22D,22D_69,A,"Yes.  And the phone just kept ringing.  I said no, I haven’t got enough time because I’m semi-retired and less is more."
22D,22D_7,Q,When you say backgrounds do you mean something that would be captured in a skills matrix?
22D,22D_70,Q,"Well, thank you so much for agreeing to the interview.  Are these, these are in the not-for-profit sector?"
22D,22D_71,A,"Yes, some for profit and some not-for-profit.  Some are institutions."
22D,22D_72,Q,"So these informal ways are how they’ve been doing it, not using the big head hunters are stuff?"
22D,22D_73,A,Yes.
22D,22D_74,Q,That’s good.  And that goes -
22D,22D_75,A,"I would think the important thing for the up and coming directors is they need to make themselves known what they are good at instead of always saying how come they didn’t select me to sit on the board.  I think they need to look at themselves first, what have they done, what have they contributed, what are they good at, what sort of skillset you are going to bring into the board, what sort of value they are going to add to the board."
22D,22D_76,A,If you think you haven’t got much to add I don’t think you should that board either.  I think self-recognition is so important.  Know what you’re good at.  You only contribute if you are good.  Not just sit there because you want to know other fellow board members.  I’m a bit different too.
22D,22D_77,Q,I like that.
22D,22D_78,A,Because I don’t need any more board positions for my next job.
22D,22D_79,Q,"Yes, you’re not on the hunt."
22D,22D_8,A,Skill matrix and also their heritage is important because there’s different points of view [unclear] 0:01:47.5.
22D,22D_80,A,"When they ring me I say no, no, no."
22D,22D_81,Q,"It’s really hard – if I really want to contribute to this okay, I’ll make the time.  We want to understand about the functioning of diverse boards.  Are there particular board functions that diversity is really helpful with?  And can you give me an example?"
22D,22D_82,A,"As I mentioned there is Asian century.  If you’re talking about for profit, a business board it’s very important for someone, for some board member to have a lot of experience in Asia.  I think that is what a diverse come in.  But of course if you are doing the NDIS, not-for-profit NDIS of course you need also in that field, has been in the industry for a long time, and inclusion of some users so that they understand the situation.  Not all decisions made from the ivory tower because actually they don’t understand."
22D,22D_83,Q,There’s that word again.  How does a board include someone with disability or someone who’s the only one from a different language background or -
22D,22D_84,A,I think it goes back to the chair.
22D,22D_85,Q,It’s the chair?
22D,22D_86,A,It goes back to the chair.  If that is what the chair wishes it will be done.
22D,22D_87,Q,And you mentioned culture.  What kind of culture of the board helps to include people?
22D,22D_88,A,"I think open mind and flexibility and really a strategic focus, talking about not this year, next year but five or 10 years down the track, what do you want that organisation to be.  Really got a vision, a foresight what to do."
22D,22D_89,Q,"And as you said earlier, right at the beginning having diverse points of view really helps with that visioning of the future."
22D,22D_9,Q,So different cultural backgrounds?
22D,22D_90,A,"Yes.  Because when you look at, for example, say for China we’re talking about the middle class – how many people will be in the middle class.   I think it’s 30 times of the Australia population.  But 10 years’ ago who would envisage that.  That means you need to be really flexible, understand the world changes every day and we really need to keep up with it.  Nowadays with technology and things, things just go so fast.  We really need to, being a chair on a board we need to be one step ahead otherwise we’re exposed to a lot of risk."
22D,22D_91,Q,And the diverse board is much better able to see these coming?
22D,22D_92,A,"Absolutely.  And also the board also needs to talk to the staff too.  I find a lot of boards I sit on they just turn up, sit in one meeting and then disappear.  The staff don’t know who they are.  But it’s so important.  That is where you can get a lot of information or when you’re conversing with staff, sitting in the canteen, at the coffee shop.  I think it’s very important to spend more time with the staff.  Because the management only gives you the all good news stories.  And it’s very important.  That means being a board member, it all depends on you can do as little as you like or you can do as much as you like.  That is why I love sitting on boards because they’re so flexible."
22D,22D_93,Q,So the chair wouldn’t mind you going and sitting around canteens doing your own research?
22D,22D_94,A,"No, just talking to staff, building relationships.  At least they know who I am.  A lot of boards I sit on only the receptionist or the secretary only can recognise 50 per cent of the board members.  Because some of them just don’t turn up.  Some of them just go straight to the board meeting and then disappear after the board meeting."
22D,22D_95,Q,"That way the functioning of the board is improved if you, the board engages with the management and the staff?"
22D,22D_96,A,Yes.
22D,22D_97,Q,Because they know the organisation more.
22D,22D_98,A,"And that is very important for any bad news.  There’s no surprises.  When you look at  a couple of years ago for David Jones saga, which is an AICD discussion topic, if someone mops the floor they will hear all the gossip and things, they will tackle that unpleasant situation a lot earlier."
22D,22D_99,Q,So transparency is important then?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_1,Q,"Good.  Now, I usually don’t refer to the people’s names because it helps with deidentifying, but I’m going to have to because we’ve got two of you at once. So 24IN -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_10,A2,That’s my role.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_100,A1,And when you’re talking about diversity are you talking just about gender or -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_101,Q,"Yeah.  Well, I’m going to open that up with you."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_102,A1,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_103,Q,"But, first of all, we’ll just go with just your general rule of thumb and know we are going more broadly so, yeah, but gender diversity we usually – everyone tends to start with in the interview so that’s good."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_104,A1,"It’s kind of an easy one, isn’t it, in some ways?  Like it’s 50/50.  We should be 50/50, right."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_105,A2,Exactly.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_106,Q,So the no brainer one.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_107,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_108,A2,"Well, even 51 per cent, and this is 23IN talking.  When we deliver training programs and one of the first things we say when we talk about diversity too we did a research project recently with a lot of government paid, unpaid government boards and there was always resistance to it, “Diversity it’s too hard and we’ve only got 15 people in our town,” “But 51 per cent of you are female but your board has only got 10 per cent female.”  Like that – it is low hanging fruit in that way and women while sometimes they may not have the confidence to put their hand up they’re always willing to work and it’s not hard to find a female with skills to sit on your board.  So it’s just a very easy opener when you’re talking to people who are resistant to it.  I think the easiest thing with diversity is women, or it should be."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_109,A1,"The no brainer just – yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_11,Q,Great.  We’ve sort of got our different voices now.  That’s perfect.  Okay.  So the organisation that you both work for targets specifically the not-for-profit sector; is that right?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_110,Q,"But you’re – the high status boards would have higher turnover, higher revenue, yeah?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_111,A1,"Yes, yes."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_112,Q,"So the higher the risk, financial risk, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_113,A1,"Yeah.  Yes and – well, yes, yes."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_114,Q,"It’s relative, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_115,A1,It’s relative because there can be huge -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_116,Q,This is 24IN.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_117,A1,"Yeah, it’s 24IN.  Sorry."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_118,Q,That’s all right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_119,A1,There can be huge ramifications in a small community of even a small community group going -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_12,A1,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_120,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_121,A1,-@ down the gurgler.  So it depends how you categorise risk.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_122,Q,"Exactly.  Yeah.  As I said it I thought, yeah, but hang on -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_123,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_124,Q,- it might be the only tennis club in town -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_125,A1,"Kindergarten or – yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_126,Q,-@ or kindergarten in town.  exactly.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_127,A1,"Yeah, yeah.  And I think it’s a shock for a lot of people when they go on a kindergarten committee once they -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_128,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_129,A1,"- if they know what they’re doing they very soon get to the point where, “Oh my God, what have I taken on?” because they understand the risk and they are collecting money and overseeing an important community asset."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_13,Q,Exclusively?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_130,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  So you provide services to help people do that, do you, your -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_131,A1,To get on boards?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_132,Q,"Yeah, to get on boards and to be accountable once they’re on boards."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_133,A2,Yeah.  This is Kyle.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_134,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_135,A2,So we have a number of services.  Probably the most is training.  So we have a number of short training courses but we offer a diploma in business governance which is directed at the not for profit sector.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_136,Q,Good.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_137,A2,"And I think it’s the only accredited governance training course.  And we’ve had – we’re oversubscribed sometimes with that diploma.  We run a series of scholarships every year, quarterly, which in partner with other organisations to allow $1000 off the cost for applicants.  We just did a women’s round which we do every year and we had over 100 applicants this time and that’s from across Australia.  This year we’re focused on Future 500 so leaders from communities that are underrepresented so not only just women but LGBQTI, Indigenous cultural and linguistically diverse.  That’s five.  We’re doing a separate disability round outside that.  What’s my other one?  And I’ve forgotten now."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_138,Q,"Age?  Do you look at different age groups, younger people?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_139,A2,We do.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_14,A1,However not exclusively.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_140,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_141,A1,"Got it.  Thank you, Margo."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_142,Q,Got it.  That’s all right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_143,A2,"And so every time we do a round and people can – so looking at those under represented groups, again, we’re oversubscribed with scholarship applications so they’ve a real appetite for it.  And I would say it’s predominantly women who are applying for those scholarships as well but there’s also short term governance training courses.  We also have a range of help sheets but many of those are free if you’re a member the Institute of Community Directors Australia which is our community arm.  Is that how we would describe it?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_144,A1,Enterprise.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_145,A2,"Enterprise.  I think it’s $65 a year for membership which is dirt cheap and you can access everything on the website including our policy bank which has a whole lot of policies developed by MOS Legal which organisations can adapt.  So an organisation that’s starting up or the woman who joins a kindergarten committee and they’re like, “My God, what have I got into?  We’ve got no policies, we’ve got nothing happening here,” you can actually access those and adapt them to the needs of their organisation.  We have a board matching service which is free.  So organisations can advertise board positions and people can apply for those positions and so we sort of facilitate that."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_146,A1,"And you can specify when you’re putting – listing a board vacancy if you’re particularly targeting, for example, people with disabilities or women or whatever."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_147,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_148,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_149,Q,Okay.  So you can target your group?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_15,A2,No.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_150,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_151,Q,Is that legal to -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_152,A1,"Well, this is what I was going to flag as I was saying it.  The wording – so you can’t say that we’re only open to -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_153,Q,We’re excluding everyone else.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_154,A1,We’re excluding everyone else.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_155,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_156,A1,But it’s around particularly – the language is something around particularly encouraged to apply.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_157,A2,We encourage.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_158,Q,Right.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_159,A1,That sort of thing so.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_16,Q,Right.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_160,A2,"A lot of the government – I think the governments – this is 23IN speaking.  The government board vacancies have like a very standard I think for Victorian state government we encourage people of blah, blah, blah to apply for this.  Yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_161,Q,Yeah.  Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_162,A1,And around that as well the same way you can specify a skill.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_163,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_164,A1,So where particularly people with fundraising experience or – yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_165,Q,"Yeah, or accounting experience?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_166,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_167,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_168,Q,"Okay.  Good.  So if you – how important do you think a diverse board is?  Let’s say one is not important at all and 10 is extremely important.  First of all, maybe, 24IN, what would you say?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_169,A1,I would say 10.  My best experiences on boards have been when you’ve got a diverse board particularly if everyone – I think there are other elements that have to come into that because there’s a lot of pain that comes with diversity as well.  So your meetings might go more quickly if you’re exactly the same.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_17,A1,"So historically, yes, the not for profit sector.  However, in more recent years we also work with funders of the not for profit sector and we work with businesses who work with the not for profit sector and we work with, if you like, social businesses so businesses that have a social purpose like, for example, our community ourselves we’re a B corporation.  So we’re actually not a not for profit but we have a social purpose.  We’re an accredited B corporation."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_170,Q,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_171,A1,"But so if you’re all pushing in the same direction towards the same mission but coming at it with different view points there can be some pain involved in that, but often you get the best results, in my opinion, but it requires very skilful chairing in my opinion.  And if that isn’t present then you’re in all sorts of trouble in which case I’d go down to a four or something if you want to achieve the mission of the organisation."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_172,Q,"Okay.  Now, I’ll just flag now we’re going to talk about board functioning."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_173,A1,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_174,Q,Can you talk in depth about that and perhaps give an example of effective chairing and non-effective chairing?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_175,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_176,Q,And how your organisation might seek to address that or -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_177,A1,"So, again, we run – we have help sheets and books on how to be a good chair and we run training courses on how to be a good chair."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_178,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_179,A1,I personally think it’s the one thing that makes a difference on a board.  My research has shown me that but my experience has more so shown me that.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_18,Q,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_180,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_181,A1,So an example of where that – I’m trying to think of one that’s not too horrifying.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_182,A2,Go for horrifying.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_183,Q,Go for horrifying but just don’t let it be identifying.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_184,A1,"I’m just – I’m trying to think of something that’s illustrative.  I’ve just been on many – okay.  Well, here – it’s kind of a dumb example but I was once on the board and the chairperson was on the board because it was good for CV but he actually never attended any of the meetings and he didn’t manage any of the business so the board was completely rudderless and there was diversity on that board but there was no cohesion whatsoever so it was a debacle."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_185,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_186,A1,So that’s an extreme example of poor chairing if you don’t turn up.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_187,Q,And this gave you your experience for your job here and some chaos control.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_188,A1,"Well, yes, chaos control.  Yeah.  And you know you need someone trying to control chaos, in my opinion.  Too much democracy is bad."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_189,Q,"Can you tell me about that.  Yeah, because controlling sounds anti-democratic."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_19,A1,Which is a business in structure but with a social purpose.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_190,A1,"Yeah.  Well, I’m into people having a say and I think – I mean this is getting sort of more into the structure of the organisation here.  I definitely don’t think I have all the best ideas.  I definitely want to hear people’s ideas, but at some point someone has got to make a decision and then everyone has got to fall in behind or decide that they’re not falling in behind. And then that’s another way of going about it, but in order to push forward, I think there has to be a degree of decision-making, and that doesn’t mean that someone needs to be a despot.  There’s a lot of consultation that goes with that or delegation.  That’s part of that as well.  Knowing who to delegate to and when and those sorts of things.  It doesn’t mean there’s just one person controlling everything.  It’s just making sure that there’s not too much chaos."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_191,Q,It’s productive.  You’re producing -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_192,A1,Productive chaos.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_193,Q,"Productive chaos, yeah.  Great."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_194,A2,I see – it’s 23IN.  I see it’s more – it’s not so much even controlling the board but you actually control the process so that the process of the decision-making is controlled -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_195,A1,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_196,A2,- and so and not everyone is going to agree.  And it’s a terrible board if everyone agrees with everything all the time anyway -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_197,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_198,A2,"- because there’s no robust discussion, I would imagine, but I’m a 10 for the necessity of diversity on a board as well because I think particularly in the community sector the boards should be representing their stakeholders.  So straightaway whatever organisation you’re working in in the community has got 50 per cent females in your stakeholders even if it’s a – and this is a contentious issue for Kath if it’s a Men’s Shed organisation those men who are there have wives or daughters or aunties so they’re all stakeholders.  So you can’t have – or women’s family violence shouldn’t have an all female board or a board of all white females in their 50s, even if that’s the predominant stakeholder group the stakeholders are broader than your direct beneficiaries.  And so I think if you really are going to represent your stakeholders or you’re going to represent the people that you are assisting in some way then your board should be representative of that.  And I don’t mean it in a tick the box, “We need to have one of this sort and that sort and that sort.”  It’s about casting the net wide to make sure you’ve got that diversity of opinion and representation."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_199,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_2,A1,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_20,Q,Right.  Are you listed?  Do you have shareholders?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_200,A2,But I agree with Kath you have to have really strong chairing just to ensure that it – the process is controlled properly.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_201,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_202,A2,"Consistently, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_203,Q,"And other people have talked about – a lot of conversations I’ve had have focused on the conflict that can be on chairs and some – sorry, on boards and some see it – most see it as the chair role but others see it as the culture of the board which I think is interesting."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_204,A1,"Well, the chair sets that."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_205,A2,"It all helps to.  Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_206,A1,"And in some ways polices it.  This is 24IN again.  So, again, as 23IN said too in charge of the process.  I think also in relation to making diversity work a chair – another place – another time where I’ve seen chairing fail is a chair who doesn’t really know the board members and doesn’t know what their strengths are and what their weaknesses are."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_207,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_208,A1,And he doesn’t seek to draw those out during meetings and in-between meetings.  Doesn’t know who is the person who is too shy to speak but would have some really good opinions if you took him for a coffee.  Those sorts of – so that’s what I mean about skilful chairing as well to really know how to bring the best out of people and not think they have the answer.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_209,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_21,A1,We have private shareholders.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_210,A1,"So, yeah.  Actually, now I say there’s a danger in saying that skilled chairing is required without saying what that means to me because that’s not a dictatorial view of chairing at all."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_211,Q,That’s right.  We have to draw down on this because everyone just like with conflict people have different understandings of conflict.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_212,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_213,Q,It’s quite meaningless but it’s a beginning.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_214,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_215,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  And same with – yeah.  So as we go if you think of any other things that the chair and the culture of the board might be relevant to, yeah, bring it up and how you influence it.  I presume you provide tools to assess for performance, do you?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_216,A1,We do have -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_217,Q,Who is on your board.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_218,A1,This is 24IN.  So we have things like there’s a skills matrix template that you can use to work out who is on your board and that includes diversity so that encourages people to think about -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_219,Q,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_22,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_220,A1,- are you all the same sort of person?  Are you all bringing the same world view to discussions?  And we have – what was the other?  There’s a board effectiveness quiz and there’s a board member effectiveness quiz that you can do to reflect on your own performance or with the board -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_221,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_222,A1,"tool you can ask your whole board to do it and that can be used as a kind of assessment tool collectively or individually or we’ve seen sometimes just the Chair does it or just the CEO surveys the board members So they can get a fix on how people think they’re doing in various areas which, of course, is always very interesting because you will have three people who think everyone is managing the finances really Well and three people who think that it’s appalling."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_223,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_224,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_225,A1,So I don’t know what you do in that -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_226,Q,Have a conversation.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_227,A1,It’s time for a conversation.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_228,Q,"That’s great.  So do you feel this rating of 10, you gave it a rating of 10, has it always been in that case so important?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_229,A1,Has it always been that case for me or has it always been important for boards to have diversity?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_23,A1,"Yeah, yeah.  So we’re a privately held company."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_230,Q,"Do you feel it has always been important?  I guess you’re speaking from an organisational point of view so from wearing the hat of the community, our community organisation, has diversity also – on boards always been a 10?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_231,A1,"Yes, for our organisation -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_232,A2,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_233,A1,- I think we’ll have – yes.  So our founders we’re a foundation full of social justice warriors -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_234,Q,"Yes, I read this."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_235,A1,- feminists -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_236,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_237,A1,"disability activists So, Yes, our very foundations sit on the belief that inclusion is important and diversity is, therefore, non-@negotiable."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_238,Q,"Excellent.  And how long has your organisation – sorry, I didn’t see that."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_239,A1,That’s okay.  2019 – nearly 20 years old.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_24,Q,"Yeah.  Great.  Okay.  Good.  Well, thank you, 24IN, that’s great.  So why did you shift and when did you shift to expand your circle of influence?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_240,Q,"Yeah, so it’s fairly new."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_241,A2,"And I might be wrong, Kath has been at the organisation a lot longer than me -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_242,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_243,A2,@ but even in the early years we were working with the Office for Women on diversity on boards projects.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_244,Q,Really.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_245,A2,So it’s sort of been from the offset we’ve been working in the space as well as having that as part of our foundational values.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_246,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_247,A2,We’ve been actively – we do a lot of work around women being nominated in the Australian honour’s system as well -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_248,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_249,A2,@ and we produced a book to give organisations like a how to to nominate women.  So I guess our diversity work has been – we’ve been active in the space as Well as just believing in it from the get go.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_25,A1,"Well, I guess we’re very – this is 24IN speaking."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_250,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That’s brilliant.  So now do you think that there’s any situation or context where diversity is not so important?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_251,A2,From a perspective?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_252,Q,Diversity of board.  I’m always talking board.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_253,A1,"Stunned silence.  Thinking silence, truthfully, because there probably is but I’m just trying to think.  Well, as I said before, if the other foundations aren’t there so, for example – this is 24IN speaking – if you don’t have a skilful – I wouldn’t say it’s not important, however, if you are driving towards a mission that’s very well defined and within reach and you don’t have the things that will make diversity thrive, thinking as I’m talking, is it okay to trade off diversity for getting to that end quickly?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_254,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_255,A1,"So, for example, if you’re talking about something as basic as running a football match, so say your local footy club, if they want to just – their mission is to put on a footy game every Saturday, no, I think – I just think it should have diversity because they don’t know then – from a governance perspective they don’t know what opportunities they’re missing.  They’ve missed out on women’s footy perhaps.  They’ve missed out on including people with – I can’t think of an example."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_256,A2,"No, and I think -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_257,A1,I’m trying to.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_258,A2,"- a football analogy even if it’s like a board of 10 men and they’ve got a really strong women’s football league they’re still missing out on the different perspectives of women around the table and so there may be 10 other things that could be happening as well as that football league.  So it’s just not enough to say they’re doing all the right things in the – for the club and women are included or the involvement of refugees.  Those blokes are doing a good job.  It’s like what else could be happening if you had more diversity around the table?  And I bet you the women are still running the canteen as well.  So I can’t see a case – I wouldn’t punish small organisations that have been founded with just five people and I’m big on board turnover, however, because I’ve been in terrible board situations where people have been there for 35 years and things just don’t change and it’s awful, but I think that boards that are starting out and the only people who put their hand up are those people in the initial stages.  I wouldn’t beat them around with a stick for lack of diversity.  They need to be on the journey to get there, they need to recognise that it’s important and that it’s something they need and at the next election they need to be putting out the call to women and to whoever else they need to diversify their board, but – yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_259,Q,And build capacity perhaps in the pipeline.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_26,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_260,A2,"Yeah, for sure, but I can’t see an instance when it’s not – when there’s not a missed opportunity through not having diversity."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_261,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_262,A1,So it maybe – this is 24IN here.  Maybe sometimes it’s excusable but it’s always desirable.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_263,A2,"Desirable, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_264,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  I think I had a sense, 24IN, that you were going – this came out in another interview with this question that diversity is wasted without – if there is no inclusion on the board.  If there is not the capacity for inclusion diversity is wasted."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_265,A1,Definitely.  So if it’s tokenistic in the true sense of the word where you invite someone with a disability but then don’t give them any facilities to get into the room or – then you might as well not bother.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_266,A2,This is 23IN.  Or listen to their perspective and then dismiss it because that’s because they’re disabled.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_267,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_268,A2,Of course they would think that way so it’s not as important.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_269,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_27,A1,"We’re very mission focused so our mission has always been – the central vision, if you like, was stronger communities through stronger community organisations.  Well, what we realised very early on in the life of the organisation is that you don’t necessarily create a stronger social sector without engaging with everyone who is around the social sector.  So just working with not for profit organisations won’t produce the change that we wanted.  So we worked, for example, with big businesses who provide services to the not for profit sector to help them provide those services better or more efficiently or more effectively, is one example.  Another example of where we came to work with other types of organisation was in the funder space.  So when I talk about funders we might use the word grant worker a bit in this conversation because that’s who we work with.  That’s local government, state government, federal government, philanthropic organisations, corporates who give money to the not for profit sector and, again, we realised that it was no good just trying to work with the not for profit sector all the time to fix their stuff.  That there’s things that other organisations are doing to them that is causing them troubles that needs to be fixed as well so we’ve shifted focus to those as well."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_270,A2,And inclusivity is – yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_271,A1,There’s proper inclusivity.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_272,A2,"Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, I guess we’re talking about inclusivity as opposed to diversity."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_273,Q,"Yes, that what we need to be clear about.  So let’s – look this language is very loose at board level and I think you guys are really well placed to help to clarify it.  Can you help me?  How do you – like when you’re talking about board diversity what’s the difference?  What do these two words mean?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_274,A2,"Part of the research that we did last year looked at the fact do you – part of the survey we did was do you provide – I can’t think of the wording of the question now, Margo -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_275,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_276,A2,@ but it was like facilities to promote inclusiveness and to allow it?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_277,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_278,A2,And it was about the example are you serving food that’s appropriate for everyone at the table?  Is there wheelchair access?  Is there men’s and female’s changerooms or toilet facilities?  Are there – so -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_279,A1,What time of the day do you hold your meetings for everybody to come?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_28,Q,So would you work the policy environment for those or – yeah?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_280,A2,"Do you take the fact that women have elder care and child care and also there was – I think one of the examples was a group that always met at five o’clock because the members of this particular board were so elderly they were in bed by half past six, but that was a time when some of the newer board members who they recruited, “We need some young folk,” they were still working or they were picking the kids up from after school care or – so it’s we – and explaining the difference between diversity and inclusivity is tricky so we try to use it when we’re communicating practical examples like that.  So it’s all very well that you’ve got a young woman on the board but are you allowing her to participate fully by examining these different things to ensure you’re inclusive?  So I think the more practical example you can give the better they can kind of get their heads around it."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_281,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  So where inclusive is about the empathetic engagement of each person around the tables."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_282,A1,And I think for me it’s not – this is 24IN now.  It’s not about inviting people into your existing structures -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_283,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_284,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_285,A1,-@ but bending the structure to allow new people in.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_286,Q,Right.  And coming from a controller -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_287,A1,Yeah.  I think you’ve got the wrong impression of what control means.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_288,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_289,A1,I think it’s -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_29,A1,We’re more on a practical level than a policy level.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_290,Q,I know.  It’s another word like conflict.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_291,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_292,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  That’s great.  Okay.  So you’ve already answered that.  That’s how you influence the priority the boards give and you’ve got it on your website.  You said you provide tools that measure it, diversity, and you have information on inclusiveness how to build it, culture, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_293,A1,"And at length, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_294,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  Now, I want what does board diversity mean to you?  Who wants to go first?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_295,A2,I think – this is 23IN.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_296,Q,23IN.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_297,A2,"- that I Probably gave my definition earlier and board diversity is representing the community that you’re working with or for, people that you’re serving.  and So diversity can look different in different geographic locations.  big city or diversity is different to some rural and regional and remote areas in Australia as well."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_298,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_299,A2,Where often the communities are really homogenous.  So if you had an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community that was 99 per cent ATSI -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_3,Q,"And we’re all female, so it’s going to be hard for the transcriber, so, 24IN is going to talk sometimes.  I don’t know.  I will say after you’ve spoken, ‘thanks, 24IN,’ or something."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_30,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_300,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_301,A2,"- then I would see that as foolishness to be reaching out and trying to find how many white people and no one lives within a 300 kilometre radius.  That diversity then would be about gender, it would be about the different diversity within that community but that can also be used as a really easy argument against diversity, “We don’t have any people like that in our town or our area”.  So I think a diverse board is where there has been a really active and concerted effort to make sure that there’s proper representation on the board of the community.  And it’s not always fully achievable in a tick the box way.  That has to be monitored really carefully to ensure that it’s not a, “We couldn’t find an LGBQTI person for our board.  We don’t really have any in our community.”  Well, of course you do."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_302,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_303,A2,But it’s also – and it’s like Kath said bending the structures so that those people feel welcome and able and want to put their hand up or are easy to – and sometimes that’s just the whole culture of geography as well.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_304,Q,Yeah.  So is this like – a bit like an organisation defines its purposes is this a bit like the board has to define its stakeholders?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_305,A2,"Well, it would -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_306,Q,It represents -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_307,A2,"Yeah, well, any good organisation should.  I mean nothing – it’s kind of -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_308,Q,And the board would do that as part of that?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_309,A2,"Yes, with the senior management."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_31,A1,So working out what are their key problems that are occurring and then what role can we play in helping to fix those.  I think I see us as a bit of an intermediary between lots of different sectors.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_310,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_311,A2,"Like our stakeholders here are so broad, so incredibly broad, that most in the community sector organisations would have, I would hope, a good idea about who their first sort of community is."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_312,Q,Yeah.  And you provide tools to help them do that?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_313,A2,Of identifying their community?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_314,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  So someone on Christmas Island can do it and someone here in Melbourne."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_315,A1,I think we’ve got stakeholder mapping exercises and things that are part of our training -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_316,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_317,A1,-@ just to raise that.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_318,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_319,A1,I think every community organisation has to do that themselves.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_32,A2,"Yeah, I’d agree."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_320,A2,Yeah.  It’s such a -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_321,A1,The raising that -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_322,A2,"- yeah, a fundamental business strategy thing."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_323,A1,I would say so.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_324,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_325,A1,And that’s kind of whether it’s not for profit sector or for profit or -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_326,Q,"Yeah, I know but it’s key to understanding your way of -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_327,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_328,Q,"- diversity and it’s not always thought that way.  It’s not linked to how diversity of stakeholders and stakeholders might be thought of more instrumentally about, well, who do we want to influence and -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_329,A2,Yeah.  I guess it’s a slightly different purpose.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_33,Q,Yeah.  Can I have an example?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_330,A1,And I guess in our stakeholder mapping we talk about all those things.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_331,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_332,A1,So your stakeholders are not only who do you serve but who do you want to influence?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_333,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_334,A1,And who can help you influence?  And who supports the board?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_335,Q,So who supports?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_336,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_337,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_338,Q,And so what about you?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_339,A1,"For me, I think a diverse board is a board that brings a variety of world views into the room and I think there’s a lot of ways of going about that and I think looking at your stakeholders is definitely part of that and represent – making sure you have the voices of your stakeholders around the table is useful and important.  I think there’s a lot of world views that if you – the ticking the box.  We talk about the diversity categories now so women, then gay, the disability, whatever.  I think you could take a broader view of world views than that.  I think there’s – where people are brought up is often not factored in and it’s hard to categorise but I grew up in a little country town and went to a public school and you don’t see that around some of the boards that I’m on.  I think I bring a valuable world view that people aren’t used to sometimes so there’s that factor as well.  So there’s just people having – people who are raised in a different country have a different way of looking at the same problem and to me that’s where you get the secret source of great outcomes from diversity is where people can look at a problem, all be pushing in the same direction but have different ways of seeing what a solution might be and feel and you get into the inclusion and then feel enabled and welcomed to provide that world view without feeling silly or talked down to."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_34,A1,So one example of getting the grant space is that not for profit organisations many of them exist on grants.  They get a lot of grants.  23IN knows more about this than I do.  So they seek grants and they get grants and then they have to report on the grants and report to the funders what they do but we were told very early on working with grant recipients and grant seekers that the processes of getting a grant were overly cumbersome or the processes of reporting on a grant were silly.  They knew they were filling out lots of reports and that no one was actually reading them.  They were just going on the shelf.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_340,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_341,A2,And then you get these great stuff emerging.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_342,Q,So cognitive diversity is a buzz word now in some of the literature and I’ve been asked to -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_343,A1,Okay.  I hadn’t heard of that.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_344,Q,"No.  A few people have.  And so I’m thinking – I’m not sure where this buzz literature is but it’s different ways of thinking and it connects very well with what you’re saying so people can think differently about – they can reason differently, they can be top down, bottom up, they can wear different hats, those different Navona hats or that sort of stuff."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_345,A1,I’m not so into that.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_346,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_347,A1,I mean I guess that’s probably – I could see academically if I was – I would probably try to categorise it that way.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_348,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_349,A1,But I think individual to individual.  It does – it’s not easy to categorise how people can – okay.  So if you had 10 people from diverse world views in the room -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_35,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_350,Q,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_351,A1,"- you may have your black hat thinker or whatever, but you get another 10 different people in the room, you’re going to get – if you’ve got truly diversity, you’re going to get 10 new different ways of looking at things.  So I think putting people into, “You’re the this person, you’re the that person,” is not as helpful to me as thinking about diversity as people who’ve just been raised differently, in a different world, in a different context."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_352,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_353,A2,"There’s a danger in that too with that cognitive diversity.  You could still get a board of 10 white guys who will say, “Well, you’re a this, you’re an engineer, and you’re a this thinker and you’re a that thinker,” and stuff, so I think you could – again, I guess some of the terms are useful to sort of hide behind, in terms of still justifying why your board is predominantly a certain way.  It’s kind of like the merit argument with women, “Well, they’re out of the workforce for such a long period of time, so of course the guys have got ahead.  Of course that sort of happened.”  So I think – and I agree with Kath too about the diversity of where you’re brought up or what your background is, what your life experience is."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_354,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_355,A2,"But, again, I think you still need to be very aware of the fact that you can still have a pretty homogenous board just saying you were brought up in Broadie, you were brought up in Toorak so that’s a good – that is good but you still have to sort of look broader and say, well, from a different country or from a different – yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_356,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  I had this woman I was interviewing her and it was one of the more exciting interviews in terms of this diversity and there was an Aboriginal painting on the wall of all these different colours and ways of interacting and she said, “That’s diversity”, and it’s sort of because it brings – there’s that cognitive different ways of thinking process versus outcomes."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_357,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_358,A1,And you need to see it.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_359,Q,"But there’s background, there’s gender."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_36,A1,So we were then able to work with the funding community to help them understand what those problems were and also offer some solutions around this is how you could do it better and one example of that is we built a software platform called SmartyGrants which funders now use to manage their grants process into which we embed some good practices.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_360,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_361,Q,There’s da da da da da.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_362,A1,"So we’re all – I just think we’re all very complex beings who are made up of lots of different things around our genetics, how we were brought up, what happened to us when we were 20 or -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_363,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_364,A1,And we bring all that to bear when there’s a governance decision in front of us and if you’ve all had too similar a path to get -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_365,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_366,A1,-@ to that you’re going to all get to a bit of group think.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_367,Q,Yeah.  Exactly.  And that’s what you want to do is to prevent the group think.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_368,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_369,Q,"Everyone agrees on that.  But, 23IN, you have introduced a new concept for me which – into this research which I think is very useful and that’s the stakeholder mapping tool using a stakeholder analysis to help you put a frame around this universe of diversity because it’s a universe of possibilities really when you start thinking of its richness.  And so how does a particular board – because you can just say, “Well, look I will just grab whoever I can because it will be diverse.  They’ve got – Joe Bloggs he came from a little village, such and such came from whatever.  He has got black skin.  He’s a” -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_37,Q,Lovely.  So you’re facilitating accountability in a very efficient way – use a friendly and efficient way.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_370,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_371,Q,"- “Muslim, she’s a Christian.”"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_372,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_373,Q,“I’ve got diversity but how does it hang together?”  And -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_374,A2,I think you can’t forget the skill diversity aspect of it as well.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_375,A1,A matrix has both in it.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_376,A2,Yeah.  So there’s – and I think -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_377,Q,The accountant talked about – yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_378,A2,"- an accountant and I talked about this a lot too is that you can say look it’s – I – this is a very basic example but not many women are in the finance profession so it’s always easier to find a bloke who is good with the numbers because that – well, that’s rubbish.  It’s like saying there’s no female CEOs or CFOs or whatever so it’s all – there’s no women to talk in the media on this subject and -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_379,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_38,A1,We hope so.  Yeah.  So that’s one example.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_380,A2,"So there’s lots of really good things coming like the Women’s Leadership Institute of Australia has got like a media bank where there’s women who are experts in a million different things.  So you can find the woman or the Indigenous person or the whatever it is that you’re looking for with the particular skillset that you need as well and so that’s when Kath is talking about the matrix it’s like, well, there’s diversity in there as well.  Like are you looking through a lens of diversity as well as the skill as well as etcetera, etcetera, etcetera?  And so when – so when I talk about stakeholders too and say they need to represent it’s also really useful to have someone outside of your organisation on the board who doesn’t know a lot or who isn’t directly involved too because they bring a different world view and so I think for not for profit boards it’s often if they’ve got skill and passion that can be really important as well."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_381,A1,And I think also a recognition.  Like in all the things that we do we’re not that prescriptive.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_382,A2,"No, no."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_383,A1,There’s kind of a recognition in our training and the tools and the books that we provide that this is an imprecise science.  You’re not going to get the perfect board.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_384,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_385,A1,"But if you’re not trying to get there and become more diverse then you’re failing, we would argue, in your governance responsibilities."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_386,Q,You’d have to ask what’s the barrier?  What do you think are the barriers?  And what have you found to be the barriers in the boards that you have influence over?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_387,A1,Not wanting to change the structures.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_388,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_389,A1,This is 24IN speaking.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_39,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  So the sort of community services would they be blossoming under, for example, a National Disability Insurance Scheme or is it completely irrelevant the sector?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_390,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_391,A1,"So we’ve always done it this way.  We’ve always met at five o’clock and we can’t get young professionals on our board but we aren’t changing the meeting time for five o’clock.  Well, no one can get there.  So there’s that sort of thing.  There’s the old stuff that everyone talks about.  The old boys’ club so that you appoint someone who looks like you.  You use your own networks.  In the not for profit sector where people are generally not paid to be on boards you’re calling favours a lot to get someone to be on the board."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_392,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_393,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_394,A1,So it’s easier to do that if it’s someone that you know.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_395,Q,"I didn’t think of that but, yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_396,A2,It’s true.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_397,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_398,A1,"Not – we would – from your research you would know all the answers to this, 23IN.  That thing, well, why aren’t you more diverse?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_399,A2,"But is there – why aren’t you – we don’t – often it was I think blackboard turnovers so the same people staying on for too long and there’s that resistance, like really basic resistance, to change.  Like, well, what difference would it bring?  We’ve got the right people here.  We often did focus groups and one of the things we heard time and time again was if someone is willing to put their hand up and bring them on and help us out then we should take them.  We should take them no matter what because if they’re willing and able then that’s great.  Why should we knock them back to get a woman on board?  We can’t but there’s – the way that particular board or committee is run is just not – it’s not accessible to women or to different people so it is the structures that aren’t changing.  It’s culture as well."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_4,A1,"Okay.  Yeah.  And if I think of it, I’ll say 24IN or something."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_40,A1,It depends what you – the disability sector?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_400,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_401,A2,I think board structure stops that and people who stay on boards for far too long and aren’t involving with like community expectations as well.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_402,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_403,A2,And also it’s harder to create a diverse board.  It’s harder.  So it’s easier for me to ask 24IN to come onto my women’s board because we’re doing this because I know she’s my mate she will do it for me.  She’s passionate about the same cause and she’s really good at chaos control so she’ll come on and then I’ll ask Rose in the office as well.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_404,A1,And I won’t ask -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_405,A2,To be paid.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_406,A1,"- awkward questions.  no, because I actually think the same as you."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_407,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_408,A2,The same thing.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_409,A1,So whatever you think is the right path I’d probably do as well.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_41,Q,"Yeah, because I know there has been a lot of change in the disability sector and a lot of -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_410,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_411,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_412,A1,So we can get through that quicker.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_413,A2,"Yeah, yeah.  So the meanings will be more streamlined and they’ll finish up and we’re all on the same page and that’s a good thing."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_414,A1,And I don’t have to put up with your annoying accent.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_415,A2,"Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We don’t have to meet at a different place because the person in the wheelchair can’t access the old place where we’re all really comfortable and so it’s just that basic resistance to change and even I think if you slam down the stats if you’ve got this on your board you’re going to do this, this and this.  We don’t need that.  We’re all right.  We’re doing all right."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_416,A1,Also -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_417,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  And we’re not paid."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_418,A1,"24IN, here just to add as well the not for profit boards are slammed.  They are busy, they are volunteers.  They’re squeezing this in around a million other things that they do, caring responsibilities, jobs, fulltime jobs.  It often is so much work it is like a second fulltime job and it’s just one more thing that is not essential, in their view, that they can easily slip down the pile.  And they don’t often have – they often don’t have structured renewal recruitment processes so it’s not like there’s someone in charge of making sure the board is diverse."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_419,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_42,A1,"I was going to say it depends on your definition of the word “blossoming” because there’s a lot of troubles, I think -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_420,A1,And in order to do that you’ve kind of got to focus on it.  You’ve got to be in for it.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_421,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  I’d imagine the fact that people are not paid.  Is that a barrier do you think?"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_422,A2,"I was on a big disability board and they wanted to diversify the board and get more women my age on the board but they were meeting at times that were – weren’t going to work for women.  They could also afford to pay board members and so I was pushing and saying, “If you want to get young, professional women many of whom are at home with young children and so they can’t volunteer 10 hours a week towards a board you should pay them expenses because they actually need the money coming into the household and not all of them are like me and I can afford to do it because my husband is earning this money or my partner is doing this,” or whatever."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_423,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_424,A2,"So there’s a particular board has just started paying.  It always happens when you step off the board and it has just started paying directors $20,000 a year."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_425,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_426,A2,So they’re going to be able to attract a different not even calibre of applicants but they will be able to attract a far more diverse board than the not for profit who is not paying.  I’m actually an advocate for paying on not for profit boards even if it’s expenses or even if it’s just a sitting fee.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_427,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_428,A2,And so I do think it is a barrier but it’s also a massive barrier for small not for profits.  They haven’t got funding to pay people to do it so.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_429,A1,It’s a hot button issue in the sector.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_43,Q,"Yes.  Well, yes, need for a – so is that a sector that you might -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_430,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_431,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_432,A1,Whether you should pay board members or not is a hot button.  And it’ll quickly -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_433,Q,I wonder -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_434,A1,-@ polarise a room.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_435,A2,Yeah.  So I don’t know where Kath stands but I know I’m an advocate for it where the organisation has the capacity to be able to do it but then the danger in that is those bigger well financed boards get – the good board members get – they just progress and progress and progress.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_436,Q,"Well, they can choose."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_437,A2,"They can choose, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_438,Q,They have a feeling they can choose.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_439,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_44,A1,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_440,Q,That was what I was wondering whether -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_441,A1,"Well, they can anyway so I don’t know that that’s so much."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_442,Q,"Yeah, but they’re the ones who can afford to.  So it’s the smaller ones who feel they don’t have choice.  They have to take whoever is offering."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_443,A2,And take it.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_444,A1,"Yeah, that’s right.  That’s right."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_445,Q,And keep them there because -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_446,A1,"Yeah, but I think it’s a – I’m a believer in paying board members if you can.  They’re – I will put it under appreciated and you might be able to force more accountability if you pay as well.  I think there’s some really poor board members."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_447,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_448,A2,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_449,A1,"However, I think it’s a moot point because most small not for profits don’t have the money."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_45,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_450,A2,Can’t do it.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_451,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_452,A1,And they would never get their constituents to come along with it.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_453,Q,Accept it.  That that’s an appropriate -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_454,A1,And everyone is -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_455,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_456,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_457,Q,"Well, is – I guess this then comes to regulation.  Let’s move swiftly there because maybe this is a way that maybe the government or maybe funding could go to paying boards who are in the little village but absolutely vital football team so that it has a diverse board and girls for the first time might be able to play with the boys on football or whatever.  I don’t know, for an example, but is -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_458,A1,"Yeah.  I mean I love – I’ll try to think of it while you’re talking, 23IN, next, but I love this idea of forcing change with a bit of carrot and stick.  I think it’s – I think – I was at a budget briefing last week and I think the Victorian government said something like that they’re going to be using their procurement processes to influence behaviour of companies.  For example, that they won’t procure services from organisations that don’t have gender diversity on their boards.  I’m pretty sure I heard Tim Pallas say that last week."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_459,Q,"Okay.  Well, it would be devastating for the village that has its shed funded by – the football shed or something funded by the government but they don’t have money to pay to attract and to feel they have choice."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_46,A1,"So that’s a sector at the moment so we’re doing a training program, for example, around governance in the disability sector because there’s a lot of new organisations.  There’s a lot of organisations changing shape very quickly, having to change their business models for the sake of the – we don’t usually use the word business but – yes.  So yes."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_460,A1,I don’t think that would – I don’t know that paying in that circumstance.  Like the footy club and – as I said before I grew up in a small country town.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_461,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_462,A1,23IN lives in a small country town.  They can totally have women on their board and they don’t need to pay them.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_463,Q,"Right, because there’s only enough."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_464,A1,They have lots of secretaries on their boards.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_465,A2,They do.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_466,A1,So there’s no shortage of women who are interested in football and would serve on the -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_467,Q,On the board.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_468,A1,I don’t feel sorry for them at all.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_469,Q,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_47,Q,"Yes, yes.  Okay.  Good.  Because trying to get just a handle on what might a community service look like from the ground so there’s a lot in -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_470,A1,I don’t think that policy will impact on them.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_471,Q,No.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_472,A1,I don’t think they will in the next few years get it.  I’m talking about -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_473,Q,Health.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_474,A1,Yeah.  So if maybe they’re doing a road building project that they won’t contract an organisation through the tender process if this big company doesn’t have any women on their board.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_475,A2,And I would fully support that.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_476,A1,I think that’s what they were saying -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_477,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_478,A1,-@ but maybe you’d want to fact check that.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_479,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_48,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_480,A1,And I think that’s what he said because I thought there’s change.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_481,Q,Who was it?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_482,A1,"Tim Pallas, the state treasurer.  He did a briefing on – a budget briefing last something or other so it was in their budget that they’d announced."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_483,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_484,A1,"Yes, yes.  I was wanting to cheer."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_485,A2,Hallelujah.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_486,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_487,A2,I think in the not for profit sector I don’t think you could force a change in that way.  But there could be – I mean you could in a government regulatory sense around grant making and stuff.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_488,A1,"You could totally with grants.  Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_489,A2,"You could say if you’re applying for funding for the new school board if we’re going with the footy club analogy – our club is very diverse, the board, but if you’re applying for the new school board and you want that $5000 part of it is sending through your governance structure so who is on your board?  And if you haven’t got – maybe it’s – whatever it is.  Maybe it’s just in line with what the governments own quotas are then either you don’t get the funding or you’re -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_49,Q,I know that sector a bit.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_490,A1,"Or you get less points loaded or something, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_491,A2,"Yeah, you get less points.  So not so much punished but there’s a consequence of not doing something that actually is quite a simple thing."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_492,A1,And one thing -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_493,Q,Like a quota?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_494,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_495,A1,Yeah.  One thing you might be interested in we do some work we call gender lens grant making.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_496,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_497,A1,So the funders that we work with – we have about 300 different grant makers who use our software.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_498,A2,Many of whom are government.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_499,A1,"Many of whom are government, not all though, and we invite -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_5,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  And, 23IN, you’re director of leadership and diversity for the Institute of Community Directors Australia."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_50,A1,"Well, and so the organisations that we have always worked with.  So we’ve talked a lot about the other types of organisation we work with but still our core are those not for profit community groups and that can be anything from a little tennis club to a church group."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_500,Q,State government or both?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_501,A1,"All.  Yeah, state, federal and local.  And we invite them to use our standard questions which when an organisation is applying for a grant asks them – it doesn’t – we don’t have one currently about the board but it asks them about where the use of the grant and how that would benefit women and girls and to make sure that they have thought about the -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_502,Q,The impact.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_503,A1,-@ impacts of the money That’s being.  in the case of government it’s community money to make sure that it’s flowing to men and Women equally and if it’s not why isn’t it?  and there may be a good reason why it’s not.  it may be a Men’s Shed.  it often is.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_504,Q,But why is the Men’s Shed funded?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_505,A1,They get a lot of funding.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_506,Q,Okay.  So that’s a creative men’s -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_507,A1,Yes.  I think you were heading towards – anyway.  I have no problem with quotas.  I love quotas.  They’re the best way to make change.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_508,A2,And simplest.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_509,A1,"Yeah, and effective."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_51,A2,To Mission Australia to anything -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_510,A2,Effective.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_511,Q,So quotas as distinct to targets?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_512,A1,As distinct to targets.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_513,Q,Okay.  You must -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_514,A1,I have no objection to targets either.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_515,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_516,A1,The quotas -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_517,A2,It’s a bit -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_518,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_519,A1,"- create change.  and I think in the not for profit sector it doesn’t need it as much because Women dominate So I think there’s a lot of Women – I would be quite happy with quotas for chairs, however, but it’s hard to get a quota for a Chair, right, on one organisation."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_52,A1,To Mission Australia.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_520,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_521,A1,You can’t.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_522,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_523,A1,So I don’t think you need quotas for women on boards in the not for profit sector.  Maybe those higher level boards.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_524,Q,But what about other kinds of diversity or is it that -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_525,A1,"I think it’s too hard, right."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_526,Q,It depends on the stakeholders.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_527,A2,"How do you – yeah, it does."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_528,A1,I think – and how do you – even in our surveys we have trouble with -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_529,Q,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_53,Q,Really?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_530,A1,"- “Do you have any gay people on your board?”  a lot of people Say, “I don’t know.”"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_531,Q,Why would they declare themselves?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_532,A1,"What are you going to go and do – exactly.  You’re not going to go around and ask everyone, “Do you have an invisible disability that I don’t know about?”"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_533,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_534,A2,Even ethnicity like what you’re -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_535,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_536,A2,Are you culturally and linguistically diverse?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_537,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_538,A2,"And we really struggle with what the right term for that is as well.  Like you could say, “Are there – “What’s the first language spoken at home when you were born?”  I don’t know.  I might have an Italian, I think, or it’s that – where gender is sort of -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_539,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_54,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_540,A1,"It’s, again, a no brainer."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_541,Q,"Well, it’s actually not anymore."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_542,A1,"Well, that’s true."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_543,Q,I hate to tell you.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_544,A1,That’s true.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_545,A2,That’s true.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_546,A1,"And you could still have – our toilets here are labelled people who identify as female, not female so.  Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_547,Q,Right.  Okay.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_548,A1,So you’re right it is complex.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_549,Q,"But, anyway, let’s stick with that language."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_55,Q,So Brotherhood of St Laurence?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_550,A1,"Yes, but I have no problem with quotas, particularly for corporate boards."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_551,Q,Okay.  So the criticism I have heard for that has been that it’s demeaning.  Can be potentially demeaning for then the women who get on boards that used to be male dominated that you only got here because of the quota.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_552,A1,That pushes my button.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_553,A2,That’s about the board culture or that organisational culture.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_554,Q,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_555,A2,"So if you were brought onto a board and you were made to feel that you were only there because you were a woman it’s not a board I’d want to be on for a start and that’s all to do with the culture of that organisation.  It’s not demeaning.  It’s like that whole argument of, “Well, it’s really hard because we can’t find the women with the skills.”  Rubbish.  Of course there’s women with those skills you’ve just never sought them out.  You’ve never looked at them, you’ve never created an environment where they could put their hand up for it.  The quota system forces them to make that environment.  Forces them to reach out and find those women.  So I wouldn’t find it demeaning to get on a board because it’s only a -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_556,Q,If people say -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_557,A1,How would you even know that you were the quota?  “Was I one of the quota ones or was I a” – I just think it’s a fallacy that -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_558,A2,It’s only demeaning if you’re made to feel demeaned.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_559,Q,You’re made to feel -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_56,A1,Yeah.  Schools.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_560,A1,Or you make yourself feel that way.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_561,A2,"Yes, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_562,Q,"Yeah.  Well, if people say, “You don’t have the skills because Joe Bloggs applied and he had” -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_563,A1,I would ask that person to prove their skills because I think it’s -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_564,Q,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_565,A1,"It’s this whole question of merit and the question of merit that pushes my buttons to a great degree because I think it was Caroline Heusen who said, “Whose merit?  What idea?”"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_566,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_567,Q,Who is judging merit here?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_568,A1,Who is judging merit?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_569,Q,Yeah.  Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_57,Q,Okay.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_570,A1,"And if you look at our – I’m going on a rave now, but if you look at our parliament there has never been a less meritocratic bunch in power, in my opinion."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_571,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_572,A1,And a lot of the very good women in the Liberal party have not thrived.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_573,Q,"So your discussion of quotas and targets and discussion about – you’re really quite assertive here around the table which is a bit different to what I’ve experienced so it’s fantastic.  Now if I go back to this quote – this assertion I made that came up in another interview that diversity is wasted without inclusion, if there’s no inclusion."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_574,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_575,Q,That’s a problem because it’s giving in.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_576,A2,"It’s incumbent on the board or any organisation to make a new person on that board feel welcome and supported and enabled to take on a proper board role.  So if an organisation is forced to have a gender quota, and they bring those women on, and they’re not made to feel – they’re not supported, so they’ve never – so the governments, at the moment, there’s a whole push about the committees that are attached to boards need to be chaired by a female.  And what sometimes happens is that women who’ve never had a chairing role are put in those committees, and then the men stand back and go, “See, she failed.  She didn’t do that well.”"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_577,Q,Set up.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_578,A2,"So, there is a lack of an inclusive environment there.  So I don’t think diversity is wasted without inclusivity, but it’s when those people are saying to you, “Well, it’s demeaning.”  Yes, it’s demeaning to everyone if that woman is brought on board and then not supported to be the best possible because they would not bring a man on and not support him to be the best possible director on that board."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_579,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_58,A1,"Anything that’s a not for profit organisation or a civil sector or social sector organisation can access our services many of which are free, some are paid so."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_580,A2,So the -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_581,Q,What do you do to prevent that as an organisation?  How – or -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_582,A1,"Again, it -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_583,Q,Coaching?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_584,A1,I always think there’s a thing about that.  We then go to fixing the women and I think that most – a lot of -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_585,A2,Fix your culture.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_586,A1,"A lot of solutions are about how do we fix the women?  We’ll give her a mentor.  Well, actually a lot of women don’t need a mentor.  They don’t need more training.  I’m always really interested in the fact that the most people that apply for our governance training are women -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_587,Q,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_588,A1,@ because often they’ve been on the kindergarten committee and they actually have a lot more training than a lot of the men that put their hands up for boards and they’re not judged harshly.  So the organisations are the ones that need fixing and I always come back to the chair.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_589,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_59,Q,Right.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_590,A1,"And I’m like if you’ve got a rotten chair who is not into diversity you’re going to have a rotten experience for those people that are brought on because of the quotas.  However, if you have a quota that requires 40 per cent, they’re never 50/50, right, you do have a critical mass of women on there who may be able to – and some good men, you would hope, who may be able to overthrow the chair.  Yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_591,Q,Okay.  So do you do anything – as an organisation can you punish?  Can you provide carrots or is it just the voluntary you can access this course?  Here are some downloads to any opportunities?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_592,A1,Yeah.  No.  We can’t do anything for anyone.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_593,Q,Yeah.  Invite?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_594,A1,"No, no."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_595,Q,And invite – you are enabled through invitation?  You’re covered.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_596,A1,We invite and enable.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_597,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_598,A2,Yes.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_599,A1,So we like to provide – we try to provide the tools that will make that a bit easier.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_6,A2,"Yes, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_60,A1,"And we work with them on a lot of different levels providing training, software, websites, yes, information."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_600,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  That’s good."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_601,A1,And a lot of the time it’s not – people aren’t unwelcoming because they’re horrible.  They just don’t know.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_602,A2,No.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_603,A1,It never occurred to them that there was another way of doing things and that if the -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_604,A2,The deliberate sabotage of that new person sometimes it’s just ignorance.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_605,Q,"Well, five o’clock is five o’clock.  It’s the habit.  It’s how we’ve always done things."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_606,A1,"Yeah, we’ve always done things that way."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_607,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_608,A2,In the training we do stress – in any of the governance training about that aspect.  If you want diversity you might have to change to the structure and here’s ways you can do it and here’s ways to reach out.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_609,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_61,Q,"Okay.  That’s a very good background because you’re an – I’m interviewing you around how you influence the boards of organisations so we’d need to understand this bigger governance framework, I guess, so that we can understand.  And you work from a little one person show under the NDIS -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_610,A2,And it’s always heartening that people are mostly receptive to that in the training.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_611,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_612,A2,The researching is slightly different because we’re looking at male dominated very small government boards and so sometimes that was a bit disheartening.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_613,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_614,A2,But a lot of that’s I always think in a couple of generations that should be gone.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_615,Q,"Yeah, which brings me to the last question."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_616,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_617,Q,In 10 years’ time -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_618,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_619,Q,In 10 years’ time how would you like to see the diversity of boards in Australia?  Who wants to go -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_62,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_620,A1,I’d love them to be a lot more diverse from top to bottom.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_621,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_622,A1,From our parliament to our – this thing –
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_623,A2,The ultimate board.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_624,A1,"The ultimate board.  People saying, “I don’t think we’re ready for another woman yet.”  My God."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_625,A2,Who is saying that?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_626,A1,I see it.  I see it all the time.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_627,A2,God.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_628,A1,So right from there to the corporate boards.  The ASX100 which are appalling.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_629,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_63,Q,-@ right up to Brotherhood of St Laurence.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_630,A1,"To not for profits getting more women as chairs, getting more women on paid boards, getting more diversity of thought.  So I’d like to see more of that.  I think we are moving in that direction."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_631,Q,So in 10 -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_632,A1,I’d like the dinosaurs to die.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_633,A2,It’s about -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_634,A1,And 10 years is not enough.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_635,A2,"Is not enough, yeah.  Generationally I guess that’s what I mean that eventually the dinosaurs will be gone in that culture."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_636,Q,"Is – yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_637,A2,"And I think that even with trust and foundations as well that those people will have died out and there’s like that new generation coming up who want change.  From not for profit boards more women in chair roles.  Some more women actually taking the mantle and leading there I think that would be a really positive thing, but otherwise I’d probably just be repeating exactly what Kath just said about in 10 years.  Yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_638,Q,"Well, thank you so much.  That’s fantastic."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_639,A1,"Thanks, Margo."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_64,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_640,A2,You’re welcome.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_641,Q,"Yeah, we got it in."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_642,A2,You got -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_643,Q,What is it five seconds over?
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_65,Q,"And private hospitals, public hospitals that are not for profit."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_66,A1,"Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_67,Q,So huge.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_68,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_69,Q,A huge spectrum.  So -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_7,Q,"Yeah.  And your thoughts, you can try and -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_70,A1,"Huge.  Huge.  And there is an enormous spectrum in the sector, as you would know."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_71,Q,"Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, a bit of it I’d know.  A few there would be lots I can’t imagine so, yeah.  Anyway, let’s move on.  Yeah.  That’s brilliant.  Okay.  Thank you for that, 24IN.  So now how have the composition of the boards that you’re familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity or not changed and what kind of boards are these?  And now I’m thinking you’re going to have a hard time because there’s so many different clients."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_72,A2,No.  This is 23IN speaking.  I think females still make up 80 per cent of the not for profit but not in senior management on board roles.  So similar to the full profit and the government – the government is different because they’ve brought in quotas and so there is sort of forced change happening there.  I still think with not for profit boards – and 24IN might have stats.  We’ve just done a little bit of research ourselves with our listed community director Australian members.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_73,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_74,A2,"I think there may be a slight improvement but you still find that females even though they’re doing the bulk of the work aren’t in the leadership positions and if they are on the board they’re often in a secretarial role.  They’re very rarely in a chair role.  So we’re trying to do a lot of work around influencing that and trying to educate and empower women to take the next step and put their hand up for the chair.  So at the moment we’re looking at doing a training program not just for women in governance but for women say in marginalised communities to actually put their hand up for chair roles.  And for women often they won’t take that step because (a) they don’t think they have the skills to do it, which is incorrect, and (b) there’s not a culture or infrastructure to encourage that within their organisations.  So even though women are dominating the not for profit sector in terms of actually doing the work -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_75,Q,"The work, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_76,A2,-@ they’re not necessarily in the leadership roles or governance roles.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_77,Q,That is -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_78,A1,And I think also – this is 24IN now.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_79,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_8,A2,"Yes, that is me."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_80,A1,"I think there’s a trend – I can’t give you any stats on it but my understanding is – you might have stats, 23IN, but is that the more prestigious board in the not for profit sector the more likely it is for men to be in dominant positions.  So a low status board – go with me on what’s low status."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_81,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_82,A1,"So a low status board, if you might think a kindergarten might fall into that category, a lot of work.  You don’t get many applaudits for being on it.  They’re dominated by women."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_83,A2,By women.  Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_84,A1,If you get to Isuzu Australia board or an OPA Australia board or even a Mission Australia board -
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_85,A2,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_86,A1,"- you know those big organisations possibly where they might be paid, then you’ll get more men on the boards. and That’s a phenomenon Probably that exists in the corporate world as Well, but it’s quite pronounced in the not-@for-profit world, where at the bottom level there’s a lot of work that gets done, and it’s predominated by women.  and the more money and the more prestige, the more men are on the boards, and particularly in those leadership positions."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_87,A2,"I’d agree with 24IN.  That’s – the more work there is to be done and the more thankless the work, the more women put their hands up to do it."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_88,Q,"Yeah.  Well, that sounds very depressing."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_89,A1,"We’re trying to change it so, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_9,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_90,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  No, that’s good."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_91,A1,"And so, I would say that some of the work – it’s 24IN again."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_92,Q,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_93,A1,"That some of the work that we would like to do more of is not just getting more women in leadership positions in those upper levels, but getting more men in leadership positions on those “lower end” boards."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_94,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_95,A2,"Yeah, yeah."
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_96,A1,Doing more of that thankless work.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_97,Q,"Yeah, so your diversity goes across the full spectrum of -"
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_98,A1,Yeah.
23IN and 24IN,23IN and 24IN_99,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
25IN,25IN_1,Q,"Excellent so we’re being recorded now. So thank you again, I’m really excited about talking to your organisation because it actually, the need to came up in some interviews I’ve done with directors of start-ups. And so it was like okay I need to understand this context. But I’ve been looking at your organisation and your annual report and it seems, well cast the net a little more broadly, but so if you’re happy we’ll start the interview now?"
25IN,25IN_10,Q,"That's what I was going to ask you, is there anyone I should exclude?"
25IN,25IN_11,A,"Yeah I’m not sure that there really is, I think most sectors are certainly beneficiaries  in one way or another of private capital investment. But what does vary at different points in time, some sectors may be attracting more or less capital than others. So over the past ten years now here in Australia for example the one sector that has consistently attracted large amounts of capital investment as compared to others is the health care sector and that's because there's been tremendous growth with the technology and advances in pathologies or therapeutics and diagnostics and coupled with of course the aging population, people receive better healthcare throughout their life. All of that has come together in a variety of different ways to make healthcare, even aged care sectors that have them high on the radar for private capital investors because of that future outlook and opportunity that is core to what type of capital investment they’re looking for is sectors and businesses that are in that sector that exhibit strong fundamentals of growth and expansion opportunities. So that [unclear] 00:08:22 and that's the reason why private capital is [unclear] track very closely the movements and the opportunities of the healthcare sector for example."
25IN,25IN_12,Q,"Well that’s interesting okay. So I see that your organisation has a role to play, not only on the board which we’ll explore soon, but the regulatory framework, so policy, like an advocacy organisation for your members. So if you’re interested in for example health is a rapid growth area, so you start to become more active in shaping policy around health, is that sort of what that means?"
25IN,25IN_13,A,"Yeah well broadly. So we, I mean we could spend a lot of time deep diving into policy areas that relate to the sectors that our members invest into which can get a little bit tricky and very time consuming. So what we tend to debate most of our energy to Margot is ensuring that the policy and the regulatory framework that sits within the financial services component of the economy is set up in a way that helps the facilitate greater investment and encourage greater investment. So in other words we want government policies to enable more capital to flow into Australian businesses to help them grow and expand to employ more people. To make a bigger contribution for the economy and so our interest from a policy and advocacy perspective is ensuring that the government of the day, whoever that might be, understands our role as an industry. And then if they put in place policies that support and encourage more investment and in some cases that might be more of a discussion about ensuring that there aren’t policies and regulations that get in the way of investment. So it depends on the context and the situation. We tend to gravitate towards those areas of policy that help to create a bigger pipeline of investing, let’s get more capital in the Australia economy rather than getting too far into the detail of specific sectors and the policy issues that might sit around the healthcare sector. But having said all that, from time to time we do, so there are significant orders of policy where we have worked closely with government in the healthcare sector for example to ensure that there is the right policy architecture in place to support things like the translation and commercialisation of high quality medical research into commercialised products and services in the Australian market then the global market. So some of the time we do that where there’s a compelling argument about increasing the flow of capital to particular sectors within our economy."
25IN,25IN_14,Q,"Excellent. So how long has, I think you’re twenty-five years your organisation I think, it’s twenty-five years you celebrated?"
25IN,25IN_15,A,"Yeah we’ve been around for about twenty-five years, that’s right."
25IN,25IN_16,Q,"Are you, would that be how long any sort of private equity has been available in Australia? Does that mark the time?"
25IN,25IN_17,A,"Yeah look I think it depends of course on who you talk to and the line that they want to draw. But broadly speaking I think capital investment in the Australia market is about a twenty-five to thirty year old industry and it has its origins in the venture side of our industry in particular. So investing in very early stage somewhat risky business ventures to help them commercialise a product or a service in the market. That was really where our industry started, yeah in the Australia economy. In markets like the US private equity, private capital has a much longer, much richer history and probably can be traced back forty or fifty years and somebody could say longer than that. It does depend on the particular line that you might draw. But for all intense and purposes here in Australia I would prompted to say it’s about a twenty-five to thirty year old industry."
25IN,25IN_18,Q,"So we’ve adopted competition policy in ‘95, I don’t know if that influenced the growth of private capital, but so -"
25IN,25IN_19,A,"I was just going to say I think the opening up of the Australian economy that occurred in the 1980s and [overtalk] 00:13:57 were part of the [unclear] 00:13:59 helped to redirect the Australian market outwardly and so that brought with it much greater awareness of what was happening in other markets around the world. And the fact that those events, those learnings if you like and experience of other markets globally [unclear] 00:14:26 it’s globally in particular helped to inform ideas that then ultimately shaped the Australian economy. So whilst you probably can’t draw a direct line between competition policy on its own, you could certainly say that all of the major structural economic reforms that were put in place certainly some years ago has certainly played a key role opening the Australian economy and that allowed us to take the learned sort of experience of offshore markets and bring them into our home market."
25IN,25IN_2,A,Sure go for it.
25IN,25IN_20,Q,"Great, well that’s really useful context for me, because as I was reading your annual report I was, because we’re focused on board diversity which we will now focus on. But I thought well it’s really this, the diversity of capital investment opportunity that is framing your organisations influence if that makes sense to you. But since, what you bring in, your organisation, your members is I understand capital from all around the globe potentially. And then so the influence that we have here then on Australian boards is shaped by the cultural experiences and other, by the backgrounds of these internationals. So it’s much more global."
25IN,25IN_21,A,"Yeah absolutely. That’s very true. I mean the capital that our industry raises in order to then be able to invest in to Australian businesses is sourced from all over the world. So you do have, and that’s I think the point you’re flagging Margot, is you do have in effect large institution investors, like pension funds, like [unclear] 00:16:23 funds, family offices. Very sophisticated global investment now looking at the Australian market, not just with interest but in fact looking at the Australian market as a driver of growth. And then there’s another point of view as a driver of investment return. So there’s a key interest in what is happening here in the Australian market from a variety of perspectives, economic perspective and policy perspective, a community and societal perspective because there is so much reliance on that offshore capital to help fund the growth of our own investment pipeline here. So your point is absolutely right and that is that Australia now benefits from that destiny breeding international experience, that helps to inform what we’re doing here in Australia. And it’s informed through the investment capital itself directly."
25IN,25IN_22,Q,"Yes. And the value add that the private capital seat on the board has will include the interest, the global interest as well to build growth, to create growth in terms of equity, its own equity. So it just brings that other interest, it’s just, do you know what I mean? So the seat on the board is not just looking at the organisation and its particular strategy, it’s also looking at its pipeline capital and the needs, yeah. So it brings that interest."
25IN,25IN_23,A,"Yeah it brings an international perspective that is informed through that flow of capital that comes from offshore into Australia. So that’s certainly the role that we looked at. The other way to look at it is complimentary and not mutual exclusive. Whichever way you look at it is that the international capital if you like, the international investment that occurs also helps to benefit the Australian businesses that are the beneficiaries of that investment capital because it allows them to partner those offshore institution investors to help them open up access to growth and expansion opportunities all over the world. So it’s certainly not a one way direction in conversation, it’s very much a two way strategic value piece here where the Australian businesses are benefiting not just from the investment capital but also benefiting from having partnerships, relationships with big sophisticated, very well networked and connected institutions all over the world that can open up access to markets and open up relationships in a way that the Australian business partners would not be able to do otherwise."
25IN,25IN_24,Q,"It’s fabulous. So this was until I was reading your annual report I didn’t realise this aspect of the diversity issues. So that’s fantastic, that’s fantastic thank you. So now I’ll go to my, the question schedule and we’ll work through that quickly. I’ve got some that I’ll leave out. So how do you think the composition of boards that you’re familiar with, you’re working on here in Australia have changed over time in terms of diversity?"
25IN,25IN_25,A,"I think there has been, there has clearly been a change and let’s say it’s a change that I think is still building right across the market now. But very clearly today in the market we have a much greater focus on diversity [unclear] 00:20:44 sense rather than simply just gender diversity. But we do have a focus now around diversity [unclear] 00:20:55 in the same way. Some years ago, or certainly twenty years ago and I think that’s a good thing for the Australian economy, it’s a good thing for Australian businesses. So there has clearly been a transition I think and a discussion is happening now every hour in every day around [unclear] 00:21:18 across the market. But I think it would also be right to say that we still have lots of work to do in the Australian economy to set ourselves up more comprehensively around diversity of experience in diversity thinking diversity gender et cetera. And I think we are still very much in the early days of bringing about that change. I think there’s still lots of work to do, there’s probably [unclear] 00:21:53 that’s where we start to see the comprehensive change that I thinks starting off in the market. So we're on our way but more work to do I think is the best way to catch that in my perspective."
25IN,25IN_26,Q,"So this is great thank you. You’re broadening, you're providing a really interesting broad view I think. How does your organisation seek to influence Australian boards? You've mention your members have a seat on the board, is there any other way?"
25IN,25IN_27,A,"Well I think that's the, rather than just we have a seat on the board it’s probably more the fact that our significant investmentand shareholders in Australian businesses they are private company investors. [unclear] 00:22:57 ensure that there is diversity at a board level, that there’s diversity at a management team level, whether it be the organisation itself. And the fact that they are either a controlling or major shareholders [unclear] 00:23:16 gives them the capacity to actually affect change. So it’s more than just a discussion [unclear] 00:23:23private capital investors can actually bring about change by directing that change occurs. Seeing partners put in place [unclear] 00:23:37, KPIs to ensure that change is actually affected."
25IN,25IN_28,Q,"So would you raise, if I gave you a scale ten’s extremely important ones not important at all board diversity, where would you put it, where would you rate it?"
25IN,25IN_29,A,What were the numbers again?
25IN,25IN_3,Q,So first of all [[participant]] 00:00:50 I’d like to understand how private capital might influence board decisions?
25IN,25IN_30,Q,Ten is extremely important and one is not important at all.
25IN,25IN_31,A,Are you talking is the question here about the business sector generally what we are connected in with?
25IN,25IN_32,Q,Well how you think how important do you think it is to have a diverse board? So relevant to -
25IN,25IN_33,A,"Okay it’s just my view, right. Look I think extremely important I think it’s ten on your scale. I think it’s critical because it’s only with a diversity experience and diversity thinking that actually ensure you get the right outcomesor the best outcomes in some cases. So I think it’s critically important there’s no two ways about it in my mind."
25IN,25IN_34,Q,"Can you give me an example of where diversity of experience and thinking benefited a decision, created a good decision or perhaps lack of it created a bad decision?"
25IN,25IN_35,A,"Sure well on the experience side definitely the board that I’ve been involved with where the makeup or composition of the board is drawn from a variety of different skill sets. And a variety of different commercial skills. But perhaps helped in a number of cases now ensure that when we’re looking to problem solve particular issues or hope to devise strategies that would achieve the vision of the institution itself, but we benefit from people around the table who can not only bring ideas to the table from their own experience, their own background, but also to challenge ideas from a three hundred and sixty degree perspective. And to do so in a constructive way that allows for the board to ultimately come to a conclusion or come to a view that is well reasoned as well as well-developed and take account of every different relevant consideration that should be a feature of the venture. And that to me is the power of that diversity is having people around the table who can bring their own thoughts in a particular problem or a particular argument or challenge. And then also for the leadership of the board whether that’s the chair or the [unclear] 00:26:57 with others around the board or table that there be an opportunity for [unclear] 00:27.05 and then to challenge and debate it. And I think that’s the sign of a healthy board rather than a boards that’s comprised of only those who are there to agree and support, that doesn’t get put before, I think there’s a certain value that comes from that diversity in the actions of it."
25IN,25IN_36,Q,"That’s great thank you, that’s good. That’s good, it’s very helpful. Do you think that there’s a situation where diversity isn’t important? Can you imagine a situation where it might not be important, just gets in the way?"
25IN,25IN_37,A,"Yeah that’s a tough one, it’s hard to answer or a scenario where that’s not the case. But this is what I would say is diversity would not be important when you have a leadership of the board viewing diversity and check the box type exercise where they are supportive of diversity in name only. Ultimately they seem to have [unclear] 00:28.36 a genuineness of a buy in to diversity. And so I guess that’s the only scenario where I can think of at the moment where that diversity is invaluable or not that good is in the scenario where the leadership of the board is not genuinely engaged in brining diversity to the boardroom conversation."
25IN,25IN_38,Q,Okay so if the boards not inclusive than diversity’s wasted I guess or irrelevant.
25IN,25IN_39,A,"Exactly. If there’s not a genuineness and a posterity to actually value the diversity [unclear] 00:29:30 order and discussion and the composition of the board I guess it’s wasted and it’s a waste of everyone’s collective energies. And so it does really start ultimately with recognition of what are the motivations that are at play for the board and particular the leadership of the board because really the chair of the board sets the tone. It sets, the person in that role sets the agenda for the board as a whole. And if there was not a genuineness about embracing diversity the benefits of it in the right way to facilitate the instillation of diversity within the board then I think you probably potentially got a recipe for disaster there. So to me it’s very critical that the leadership of a board bring a genuineness to this and if they are unconvinced by the merits of diversity or they see it as a tick the box exercise then there’s probably a separate conversation that should happen about whether or not the right leadership is in place and if there is a gap in knowledge or a gap in understanding the true value of diversity. There are ways to remedy that and I know that in the past probably ten or fifteen years there has been a need for board shares particularly those that have been professional company directors for a long time perhaps, there has been a comprehensive program of work carried out where it’s been an attention to ensure that new knowledge, new insights are brought to the boardroom table around the benefits [unclear] 00:31:37 value, the virtues of diversity because it’s not a conversation that we had twenty or thirty years ago when perhaps those directors first started becoming professional company directors. So everyone’s gone through that [unclear] 00:31:54 journey and if there are pockets where the [unclear] 00:32:01 around knowledge building in this area and maybe has not occurred then there should be effort put into making sure that those gaps are closed."
25IN,25IN_4,A,"Okay well I guess the starting, the logical starting point would be to frame some context around the role of private capital from a governance point of view and a financial investment perspective in the context of businesses. And this applies mainly on a governance and whether we’re talking about early stage, recently formed, start-up type businesses or mature [unclear] 00:01:29 larger institutions it’s the same broad principle on that. And the private capital investor tend to be significant shareholder, in the case of equity investors we do have forms of private capital investment but are more geared towards say debt rather than equity. But I’ll generalise for the moment and talk about equity investment. And so when private capital investors invest they put into business, they tend to become in many cases major shareholder and controlling shareholders of the business. And one of the features of private capital investment that is uniquely different to other forms of equity and debt investment really is that it is a much more active asset management strategy than most other more traditional passive strategies. And what that really means that once the investment is directed into a particular business the private capital investors whether they are private equity firm or a venture firm or private credit fund tend to play a very significant role in guiding, well defining and then guiding execution of strategy for that to work. And often, not always but certainly in most cases rather than most that ultimate result in the type of capital for taking seats on the board. And that could be one seat, it could be more than one seat, it depends on the context and the extent to which they are shareholder influence."
25IN,25IN_40,Q,"So building capacity, board capacity to function as a diverse board is key then?"
25IN,25IN_41,A,"Absolutely. We have to have the right knowledge around this conversation, you have to the right experience, you have to have the right motivations. I think that’s really important Margot because I’ve certainly seen over the years not just in the diversity complex, but in other areas your focused on, the other one that often is commonly in discussion today is ESG and I know you can sometimes make it all about board diversity with good governance and good ESG practices more broadly. But there has been in years past, this is what I’ve seen ESG discussed as a tokenistic check the box type initiative that boards want to ensure that they’re saying all the right things and get straight onto the right things. In reports et cetera and things that are shared publically but there is not necessarily a genuine preparedness to embrace the principles around the table. And I think if those [unclear] 00:33:41 exist we need to either seek to turn that around by the knowledge and capability capacity around the boardroom table. Or ultimately weed them out, one of the two things have to happen."
25IN,25IN_42,Q,"Yeah. So it seems, it’s as you say the leadership but also the culture of the board which includes the motivations of the players of the directors in the context of the leadership. And then do, we’re trying to build a model, a descriptive model so I’m seeing how this, I’m sort of trying to develop as you’re speaking because you’re linking board capacity, is my understanding, is leadership being the chair, that’s, but then there’s the culture of the board because the values and the motivations of the board itself are really important to develop otherwise it’s wasted, it won’t happen. And then there’s the skills and experience as well because the open debate and all that sort of stuff has to be able to happen. That contributes to that. Good I’ll leave that now. That’s great, so I know you’ve talked about diversity quite a bit what it means to you, but could we just have you tell me what board diversity means to you, because we might end up quoting if we like what you say."
25IN,25IN_43,A,"Well board diversity for me is about ultimately delivering a better outcome for all stakeholders involved with the activity of the organisation, or impacted by the activities of the organisation. And so in many respects if you adopt and expand the view of that sort of statement, that definition in my mind, it almost means [unclear] 00:35:58, they are your stakeholder base in many cases, maybe not in all but in many cases in today’s business world the community at large, society at large is a [unclear] 00:36.16 group because of the social [pipework] 00:36.:21 that binds organisations with their purpose in the community, their purpose in society. And I think that really capsulate for me what diversity is about, is ensuring that you ultimately deliver the best outcomes for shareholders, the best outcomes for all stakeholders that are in one way or another touched directly or indirectly by the business."
25IN,25IN_44,Q,"That image that you’ve given me is great, [[participant]] we’ve got the shareholders, social context and then the purpose of the organisation is almost like a negotiation or a collaboration between these. But I can see the potential for tension between perhaps the social context and shareholder interest because sometimes financial interest can vary from social interest. And within the shareholder interest because we’re thinking about private equity which is globalised the source of capital, so there can be, is there room then for a tougher negotiation between shareholder and social context informing the purpose of the organisation?"
25IN,25IN_45,A,"Look I think there’s always an opportunity for something like that. I think that in today’s world so much of the success of any business or organisation is tied to its purpose, its print within the community and society, the way [unclear] 00:38:22 community. Business, doing business today is a very different proposition to doing business twenty or thirty or fifty years ago. It is no longer acceptable today for all management team business to say [unclear] 00:38:43it’s all about return to your shareholders and everything else is a second order or third order. I don’t think that works, I don’t think that narrative reflects contemporary expectations across society of businesses. Everyone in today’s society, everyone in our community expect businesses to operate with a very clear labour focus, labour sharp focus on yes the business objectives and realising a strategic vision but also doing the right thing by the community and that includes doing the right thing by your workers, by doing the right thing ensuring environmental impact that you might have in the way that you use energy. In the way that you use resources, the way you discharge resource, you name it, every single [unclear] 00:39:54 today is different. And I think business that will success and continue to succeed in the future recognise that change. And they’ve been a part of bringing about that change for the past decade or more. And business that will increase and then it find it more difficult will be those businesses that have not recognised the change that’s occurred and have struggled with that. And businesses that want to continue to hold onto the ideal, their only reason for existing because they were turning a profit. I think businesses that are stuck in that paradigm are likely to go with the dinosaurs and likely to be disrupted. But I think other organisations or other business that will come in and bring a different value set to the table and a value set that may then appeal to much wider universe of investors, a much wider universe of potential workers and employees and a much wider universe of customers importantly. So I’m very clear on the fact business today [unclear] 00:41:12 and there’s clearly a role for directors as part of business to ensure that transition occurs in the right way."
25IN,25IN_46,Q,"Brilliant. So let’s call this a sustainable footprint so for business. Your investors that come through, your members do they all share and must they share this view of responsible social footprints let’s call it."
25IN,25IN_47,A,"Absolutely, because and there’s a very clear reason for that. And that is first and foremost it is just smart business practice, it is smart business practice to ensure that you set your businesses up for success by ensuring that you manage all of the various risks that is in the context of the business doing what it does. And also that you seek to identify the opportunity that arise as a result of that. I mean far too much in today’s business world is defined by risk and therefore risk means you are [unclear] 00:42:30 what you can do [unclear] 00:42:34 the scope of what can be done. Whereas the smartest business today are those that are managing risks but spending the majority of their time having put in place strategies and solutions to achieve that. They’re spending most of their time defining and adapting to opportunities. And those opportunities tend to arise because other businesses might be slow to change or businesses might be slow to adapt and bring about change in what they do on a day to day basis. And there are other business that are out there that are more agile and capable of adopting to exploit those opportunities. And I think that’s a good thing, that’s ultimately what competition is all about, what open markets are all about and that’s why a globalised economy which we are now, or a part of is all about."
25IN,25IN_48,Q,"This is wonderful, this is so good, thank you. I’m enjoying it [[participant]] you’re connecting so much you’re giving me a big picture as well as a really clear one. Thank you. Does your organisation do anything to cultivate board candidates? And I was wondering perhaps your?"
25IN,25IN_49,A,"We don’t directly get involved in that Margot because each of our members firm, each of our profit capital investment firms manage it all themselves, they sort of manage the food and cultivate the pipeline of challenge if you like for directors in particular. But what I would say that the conversation that we’re having now, a conversation that we’re having across our industry and have had across the industry now for many years, so all of the players in our sector, all of the institution investors who sit behind private capital investment firms, they’re all very aware and experienced at not only achieving the sorts of outcomes that we’re talking about but also ensuring that we’ve got a pipeline of talent at a director level in particular, helping to ensure that you support achievement of those outcomes on a business level."
25IN,25IN_5,Q,"Well that’s, right okay that’s really good. So would that be in all investment by equity investment, would it always involve or what percentage would involve with a seat on the board? That level of involvement."
25IN,25IN_50,Q,"Right so would your, you know how the private equity company has a seat on the board of the organisation, would they act as like a champion of this model that you’re talking about?"
25IN,25IN_51,A,I mean ultimately all of the investors achieve a position on the board more broadly. They champion these ideas because they make sense from a business point of view and there’s a genuine belief in it. So bringing those objectives to the boardroom table is certainly part and parcel that our private capital investment teams do day to day as part of the strategic value that they bring to the businesses [in which they invest] 00:46:04.
25IN,25IN_52,Q,"I can see this has a potential to be very transformative. I mean if the sorry what do you call it, private equity board, let’s say the director gets on a board that’s perhaps a little bit old fashioned, they can be very transformative working with the chair to transform the culture to this much more open dynamic future oriented."
25IN,25IN_53,A,Yeah absolutely. And that’s the core value proposition of what private capital investment is all about is [unclear] 00:46.48it’s about active asset management to bring about change and to bring about growth and expansion within the business. And the way you achieve that in the business is there a not one size fits all recipe but it’s clear you need a different initiated strategy from what you would see in more passive asset management strategy like [that equity market] 00:47:18 for example where fund managers would simply be buying and selling equity holdings based on a set of metrics with really no significant day to day thoughts over the strategic or operational direction of the business. That is different the way in which you bring [unclear] 00:47:38 brings to the economy that other strategies simply don’t.
25IN,25IN_54,Q,"Very interesting very good, this is completely surprising. This is not my area by the way [[participant]] I’m not, finance is not my area so I’m corporate governance so more socially politically, so it’s very exciting for me. You’re very clear by the way. So what would you see, we’ve got the last three questions and we’ve got fifteen minutes so that’s good. What do you see as the main barriers to building diverse boards in Australia, how do they work?"
25IN,25IN_55,A,"I think it’s, I don’t necessarily see that they’re significant [unclear] 00:48:30 I think in our outlook on the [unclear] 00:48:39 I think what becomes really important is continuing to build knowledge, capability and capacity in your sector. And in doing that I think we tend to strengthen the pipeline of our future. So I think what becomes really important is more discussion, more leadership thinking to occur, more case studies, more workings of how diversity in thinking, diversity in experience, diversity in gender who those things actually do help to transform business to bring about change and to ultimately make better businesses. We talk in our industry about the role in private capital [unclear] 00:49:27 business to invest for growth to invest for the long term and to help improve the business to be bigger, stronger, better over the medium and longer term. And so I think any opportunity we have right across our economy and across the business sector to continue to build knowledge through lived experience. More people getting up, talking about [unclear] 00:49:54 their experience what’s worked well, what hasn’t worked well. I think all of those forces will help to feed their future pipeline in the way that we need it to be built."
25IN,25IN_56,Q,"So through stories, through sharing stories of success."
25IN,25IN_57,A,"I think so yeah because everyone is interested in stories and case studies, everyone likes to put themselves in the shoes of someone else and try to understand the dynamics of  [unclear] 00:50:30 from another perspective. So the more opportunity we have to do that I think the better."
25IN,25IN_58,Q,"That’s really interesting. I think case studies are a powerful tool but excellent. We’ll take that on board I think. From a regulatory perspective how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted? So when using targets, quotas, I notice that you have, I report you put some research out 2018 on gender diversity."
25IN,25IN_59,A,"Yeah we did. Look I can see the approach that different element of the diverse sector, and even different sectors within the economy do necessarily need to be [unclear] 00:51:27payment for the stakeholder community. I think it would be wrong to simply say that there’s a one size fits all approach and that approach is to set a target of X percent and must have this number of female representation at the boardroom table and these people go about it in that way. I think there is a role for departments to deliver a place for target setting in certain measured ways to help focus the minds [unclear] 00:52:02 achieving change and bringing about change. So I’m certainly not suggesting that targets are for a longer strategy, but I am saying that targets are a tool in the toolkit of strategies but each set that ultimately will teacher its own unique context that requires strategies that are suitable and align to bringing about change in the right way. So I think you’ve got to recognise that there isn’t a one size fits all and that you don’t need to be quite [unclear] 00:52:40 in the approach in the parts that you’re wanting to bring about change in the way that you like."
25IN,25IN_6,A,"Generally it would be reasonable to say Margot that generally in all cases yes, there may be some exceptions where that isn’t necessarily the approach but in most cases the answer they would be looking for board representation because that would be that primary mechanism, the primary channel through which the private capital investments will seek to influence and bring their strategic direction on the business and bring the value add that private capital investments bring. It’s not about necessarily taking a seat on the board to exercise some sort of veto rights or to stop things from happening. It is more about actually bringing value to the business and that playing of the value add hands off that sort of strategic council role for the business. That's really where private capital is different to other forms of equity investment. You could be a minor shareholder in a company and have virtually no say other than at formal junctions in case of a sort of cycle of general meetings or what have you. But generally speaking you would have very little to no say over the day to day strategic direction of the business. But what is different in the private capital context is that you will have a very significant say over the day to day strategic direction by virtue of the active asset management strategy that other capital investors are looking to bring to the business that they invest in."
25IN,25IN_60,Q,"So how, you have talked about things that can’t be measured, well not, it’s hard to measure them that are really important like experience background you can measure but bringing it to the table, broad culture is really hard to measure, to say you’ve got a ten out of ten. And yet you said without that inclusive culture on the board, and without a leader, a chair who will lead such inclusion diversity’s lost."
25IN,25IN_61,A,"I think so because so much of the time is, [unclear] 00:53:30 as it were and at a board level other times in the same way it does at a management level."
25IN,25IN_62,Q,"So what do you think, how might we go about regulating? Has regulation a role to play do you think given this?"
25IN,25IN_63,A,"Look I think it’s probably less about regulation per say, it’s very hard to regulate, it’s hard to say this is the best way to do something. And therefore this is the only [unclear] 00:54:09 way to do something. I think the better approach is for regulation and policy to help set the right frameworks in place to ensure that [unclear] 00:54:21 that might exist to bringing about great diversity [unclear] 00:54:27. And then in the different ways that policy and regulation can do that, the corporations law for example needs to be sure that it doesn’t, in setting the parameters it can get [unclear] 00:54:45 well skills and attributes of directors and responsibilities of directors from a legal perspective. But we constantly need to monitor our regulatory policy frameworks to ensure that none of those things are inhibiting the growth that we want to see incur in bringing [unclear] 00:55.12 obviously. But I think ultimately it is less about then directing through policy and regulation, it’s more about using the frameworks that are just around that business sector, that could be [unclear] 00:55:31 that can be applied to the business via a shareholder, via a general meeting, via frameworks that the business itself puts in place on the standards, the values, the business itself, puts in place and then shares experience with the community at large. And the role of other businesses in the same sector or adjacent sectors, they become also in many respects opportunities to become standard bills, or leading practices, the role of international capital in also putting in the best ideas, the best thinking to the table given the Australian market. I think all of those things together are ultimately the right mechanisms to which you bring about and facilitate or get a change to occur. I think there’s a fine balance that [unclear] 00:56:35 to do the right thing for themselves because it just makes sense to do that. Whereas it’s probably [unclear] 00:56:47 and regulation that are directive and instructive. I think there's a balance there that we need to constantly manage carefully. And that balance may change from year to year over a period of time we may need to recalibrate the [unclear] 00:57:12 to the changes we've seen in the market."
25IN,25IN_64,Q,"I see what you mean, I mean if policy and regulation is focused on removing inhibitors you've retained the capacity for the organisation to as you said earlier to be much more agile to respond rather than react to risk, to respond to opportunity. So you wouldn't want regulation to get in the way of that."
25IN,25IN_65,A,"Yeah that's right and I think the community, particularly through the platforms that every single person has access to [unclear] 00:57:56 social media, you know the role of media in holding businesses to account. And I think media [unclear] 00:58:06 but social media is part of that. I think that's more readily accessible today than it ever has been in the past. So I think i said this earlier but  business that fail to adapt and fail to change in recognising the shift that has occurred in community and societal expectations of business, those business won't get [unclear] 00:58:29 the next few years. And so then the role of the community at large in holding businesses to account is ultimately one of the most powerful [unclear] 00:58:42 access to supervise change to occur but it hasn't."
25IN,25IN_66,Q,"We're back to medieval times, social shaming. It’s good."
25IN,25IN_67,A,"Human psychology, sometimes being embarrassed, being ashamed, being named, put in the spot light in a negative way can sometimes be the motivation that some need to get off their backside and get moving with something. So a lot of people don't need that to act and change. And other people don't need to be named and shamed to the world. But some do and it’s backed the way that ultimately they are driven to respond and sobeit, the reality is that there are now very quick mechanisms to bring about that naming and shaming that didn't used to exist ten or twenty years ago. And so the start-up strategy today [unclear] 00:59:49 not made to be made an example of [overtalk] 00:59:54 example."
25IN,25IN_68,Q,"Yeah exactly. That's great, now [[participant]] this is the final question I'd just like you to sit back and think ten years into the future how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
25IN,25IN_69,A,Well I think ten years from now we're not talking about it that it’s a good result.
25IN,25IN_7,Q,"Brilliant that is so clear, thank you so much [[participant]]. So what kind of industry does private, I'm not sure of the distinction between private capital and equity investment, but if there's any. But you said private capital so let's, what kind of industry does private capital invest in in Australia?"
25IN,25IN_70,Q,We’re living it.
25IN,25IN_71,A,"If it’s no longer a discussion if there's no longer a need to do research papers and studies into how they're going and whether they've been poorly [unclear] 01:00:29 I think that would be a good line Margot that in fact it’s become so normalised now that we're at a point where it’s no longer even a discussion, it’s just taken as business as usual. And our focus is directed elsewhere. I think that would be [unclear] 01:00:49. I'd like to think that's where we'll be.  I think there's every reason for us to be positive about the future, positive about the change that we've seen occur over the last decade already and therefore I think we've set ourselves up very well to continually work through the change that is necessary over the coming decade. But of course time will tell whether or not we iterate that. But for me it'd be a question of if we're not talking about this in ten years from now or even some years from now then I think we can all be comfortable that we've achieved something and we've brought about that change."
25IN,25IN_72,Q,"That's lovely, I really liked that. I have so enjoyed our interview it’s been for me so interesting and inspiring to be honest. The message I've come away with is that we are among, we are undergoing a capital and social reform, a transformation and business, good business, responsible business, sustainable business is the outcome. And diversity is centre to it, central to it."
25IN,25IN_73,A,Very much so.
25IN,25IN_74,Q,"Thank you so much [[participant]] I am so pleased you found the time. I know you're mega busy so really I’mincredibly grateful, thank you."
25IN,25IN_75,A,"No problem happy to help, if there's anything i can do you know where to find us and look forward to hearing more about the work as you come to finalisation."
25IN,25IN_76,Q,As we move forward yeah. Yeah well you're on our list now [[participant]].
25IN,25IN_77,A,Perfect.
25IN,25IN_78,Q,Okay bye-bye have a nice day. Yeah see you.
25IN,25IN_79,A,"Alright thanks Margot. Thank you take care, bye-bye."
25IN,25IN_8,A,"Well it’s actually very broad, we have private capital investment firms that invest into just about every different industry sector in the market you could imagine. We have firms that invest into the mining and resources sector. We have firms that invest into all of the traditional markets or sectors such as retail, tourism, hospitality, transport, manufacturing, services, health care. I don't actually think there's a sector that doesn't in one way or another potentially attract private capital investment."
26D,26D_1,A,[coughing] Excuse me.
26D,26D_10,Q,"Correct, okay.  So let’s get into it.  First of all how has the composition of these kinds of boards that you sit on how’s it changed over time the composition of these boards in terms of diversity?"
26D,26D_100,Q,So for example your member on the board that’s from a financial services background because they’re key stakeholders for your board?
26D,26D_101,A,Yes.
26D,26D_102,Q,That would be an example?
26D,26D_103,A,Yeah.
26D,26D_104,Q,"What about consumers, like people who are small business owners?"
26D,26D_105,A,"Well yes.  So if I look at the [Segay] board for example to have people on the board that are actually close to the membership is helpful because you hear, you mix, you understand their needs, so that would be akin to the consumer.  To have people that are close to academia, because we – at CPAB, we embrace thought leadership initiatives and projects, even just the changing face of education, so to be able to plug in to that network to discuss where education is heading through to government, development of policy, and development of laws, through to regulators.  There’s quite a lot of stakeholder management and if you’ve got – life is so much easier if you can reach out to people and be able to have an open door."
26D,26D_106,Q,I imagine it might even be unaware of the potential impacts of regulatory trends or that if you don’t have someone into that field or has an understanding in that field for example.  So it helps the board to be more strategic doesn’t it?
26D,26D_107,A,"Yes, yes.  It just means you’re not acting – you’re not in a little cocoon locked inside a boardroom making decisions with windows, blinds drawn and the windows closed.  You’re actually using the information that you know to make even better decisions.  I think it’s quite critical frankly."
26D,26D_108,Q,"Yeah, so you see social networks as an extension of the diversity of the people on the board.  It’s like feeding back into the -?"
26D,26D_109,A,"It’s almost what can you bring to the role and it’s – you get me but me means how I’ve got to be where I am is because I’ve had this experience, this experience, this experience and for example with me I do a lot with members, I do a lot with standard sitting boards, so I do a lot with regulators.  So I can facilitate discussions and when we’re – the organisation may need to be part of I can get them in the room which is important.  The other is that when we’re discussing things about where the organisation should head that knowledge that you’ve gained from all different parts you don’t leave it at the door, you turn around and say this – that’s really great but it’s not going to work because this – this cohort would be really unhappy with that or I know that this project’s already been implemented by somebody.  And it’s not giving away confidential information, that’s not what I’m talking about, it’s just that wealth of knowledge that you gather in your life you can harness it and it makes you the person that you are and the skills that you bring to the table."
26D,26D_11,A,"I think they’ve gone from being more adhoc.  The one that I sat on the longest I was the first female on that board.  They had never had any other females and around the table it was very – whilst they were all different people they were all very similar, similar backgrounds, similar ages.  So there was no diversity at all.  As -"
26D,26D_110,Q,It’s a lot for a new – a person wanting to be a member of the board to be part of an interview with this wealth -
26D,26D_111,A,It is.
26D,26D_112,Q,-@ that you bring.  So yeah interesting.  does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others do you think?
26D,26D_113,A,"No, I don’t think so.  But do you have thoughts –?"
26D,26D_114,Q,"Would it change, would that vary depending on a situation?"
26D,26D_115,A,"I think so, yeah.  I do.  I think if depending on the board and the purposes of the organisation it may give rise to the shape of the board being different from just the traditional structures."
26D,26D_116,Q,So why do you think in 2005 you were brought onto the board?  What prompted that?  Why did it become important?
26D,26D_117,A,"Well I think I – maybe if they looked at it and thought that they needed to do something about diversity, who knows, I’m not quite sure.  They also – they also wanted to – it was strategic from their point of view because they were looking to strengthen the relationship – a relationship and I was a mechanism to be able to strengthen the relationship."
26D,26D_118,Q,So this is a social network as you would define it that you brought.  So that was seen as a strength and your background.
26D,26D_119,A,Yeah.
26D,26D_12,Q,And what were the ages and background?
26D,26D_120,Q,Brilliant.  Excellent.  So – and then you happen to be a female.
26D,26D_121,A,Yeah I think it – that was perhaps accidental but it – it ticked a few boxes.
26D,26D_122,Q,Because when did targets come in?
26D,26D_123,A,Much later.
26D,26D_124,Q,It was -
26D,26D_125,A,I’m not quite sure.
26D,26D_126,Q,- about 10 years later or something.
26D,26D_127,A,Yeah.
26D,26D_128,Q,"So this was before targets, so it’s interesting.  Okay.  Board functioning: we want to understand how diversity influences board functioning.  You’ve talked about group think, so are there particular board functions that diversity can really help with and can you give me an example?"
26D,26D_129,A,I think it’s just well making sure that you varies the broad range of skills to be able to discharge all the duties that a board has to do.  So to make sure that there is that diversity amongst the board that the board can make sound decisions and drawing on the various skillsets of the different board members.  And I also think that it just helps people – it bring different styles and different thought processes to the board table which I think produces better outcomes.
26D,26D_13,A,"All male, 40s/50s, senior in their roles, white Anglo-Saxon.  So very atypical of what boards, I think, used to look and some still sadly.  But we – we consciously, when I joined that board I think it was a bit of a oh goodness moment that – and they thought they were embracing diversity by having a female join the board, one.  I’ve recently rolled off that ball and they now have 30% female and a really good mix of other skills and traits as well and it was a very much a conscious decision when they were recruiting for the board to look at diversity issues.  So we had made significant changes.  The other board that I sit on, which I’m only – I’ve only been on just over a year – come in, come in, she’s bringing a drink.  Thank you.  Cup of tea."
26D,26D_130,Q,Can you give me an example of that latter one?
26D,26D_131,A,"I think it just is about how we approach decision making and how different people unpack different decisions.  We’re all presented with the same decision or resolution that needs to be made and then it’s just how we get to actually the end result.  And that’s why I say it’s really important because I can prepare for the meeting, have my views and then I’ll go to a meeting and I’ll hear someone else and it will either – the way that they have – and different issues that they have taken into consideration, things that perhaps I hadn’t thought about and I also think yeah, you know, they’re right and that’s really good and I hadn’t – I hadn’t thought about that.  And now that I have I think such and such."
26D,26D_132,A,"So it helps and as a consequence of that it makes – I have grown as a consequence of watching how other people also apply things.  So I have – I feel like I’m a very – I’m a very different person then what I was when I joined the first board all those years ago because I have looked at what other people have done and not mimicked them, but I would like to think that they have educated me to grow and to embrace different thoughts, different ways and that is a – that’s a really good outcome for me personally but it’s also provided a much better outcome for the organisation."
26D,26D_133,Q,"That’s great.  No-one has articulated that so clearly that there’s a – there’s a benefit for the board member of diversity.  It’s actually motivating, reinforcing."
26D,26D_134,A,I am so thankful because I have – I really have enjoyed the experiences that I have and as I said I’ve grown significantly professionally and personally as a result of it.
26D,26D_135,Q,"Excellent.  That’s great, thank you.  Where are we here?  Do you think there’s a situation where diversity might limit or undermine the performance of the board?"
26D,26D_136,A,I think it would be where people are so conscious of diversity that they don’t put the best people on the board.
26D,26D_137,Q,Okay.
26D,26D_138,A,"And that comes back to what I say is the selection always has to be of the best people with mindful to diversity, and one would think that you should be able to cater for both but you should not compromise quality for the sake of diversity."
26D,26D_139,Q,"Okay.  So if for some reason your proffered candidates there was tension, conflict between diversity and the best, so it was an either or, you would go for the best person rather than the diversity.  But I remember hearing Penny Wong talking of women on boards for example and she said – she was given a proffered list and there were about two women and 50 men and she said, “Give me another list, I can’t believe that there aren’t 50%”."
26D,26D_14,Q,That’s nice.  Lovely.  Beautiful thank you.
26D,26D_140,A,"See that comes down – that thing comes down to the identification in the first instance.  It’s about people being open minded to ensure that they haven’t – they haven’t adopted an unconscious bias to say, well I’m only – diversity means we have to have two or three out of ten, that’s what we’ll do.  But if it’s – if there were 10 fabulous women for example then there’s 10 fabulous women, if there’s 10 fabulous men and they couldn’t possibly find a fabulous woman one would have to – you’d have to wonder why but if that was truly because it was so narrow or so unique then I don’t – I think that you’ll always have to make sure you’ve got the best."
26D,26D_141,Q,Yes.
26D,26D_142,A,But I just don’t think that it’s that hard to find people from different backgrounds that are not fabulous.
26D,26D_143,Q,"I mean it might be – if a cultural background it might be people from a different ethnic background for some reason, you might look for diversity in terms of ethnicity and it might be that you have fewer to choose from because of lack of opportunity in that sector.  Probably not in your board, it may not be relevant except if there’s a whole lot of businesses from – drawing from that space, I don’t know, from new businesses from recent immigrants who perhaps from refugee backgrounds.  I know the government is in – there’s some supports to get people like that into small businesses.  I don’t know if there’s – but let’s say you had a substantial segment going rogue from that group maybe understanding that sector would be relevant?"
26D,26D_144,A,"Yes.  But I don’t think you need to – you need to have an understanding of board level but you don’t need to have someone that’s not got the skills at board level.  And to me what that means is that an organisation if they are saying, “We can’t find quality candidates with the diversity that we need” we have to ask why is that and are we exercising our conscious bias and ruling people out that are really suitable.  Or if there are really none how do we remedy that in the future?  And that will be your leadership programs that you put in place so that you do have this pipeline coming up of people who will have, not perhaps right this moment but within a relatively short space of time, the skills that you need.  But compromising skills on a board is dangerous."
26D,26D_145,Q,Beautiful.  So the leadership programs you’re talking about?
26D,26D_146,A,"There’s leadership programs that – for example a lot of the banks identified some time back that they had, in their senior ranks, they did not have diversity, and they have consciously set about identifying suitable people and ensuring that those skills are grown.  And that is – again it’s an investment in the future so they are consciously acknowledging that by a certain point of time – and this is, I suppose, where targets become handy is because you set yourself some goals for in the future that we want to be able to have a representation that looks like this at board level but to do that we need to have the candidates to choose from and we need to grow people into those roles."
26D,26D_147,Q,Brilliant.  Okay so that’s a board driven – that would be a board driven strategy that leadership -?
26D,26D_148,A,"It would be a board driven strategy, yeah."
26D,26D_149,Q,"Perfect.  So with – are there any decisions or functions of the board that really is irrelevant, diversity is irrelevant?"
26D,26D_15,A,"Thanks very much Victoria.  Lovely.  The other board that I sit on I’ve only just – as I said I’ve only been on that just over a year or 18 months but there’s been a very conscious decision there to address diversity, and that’s a very balanced board.  We actually have – currently we have more females than males on the board which would be unusual but makes it a very well balanced board.  And we all have different backgrounds and different age groups and it works very, very well."
26D,26D_150,A,"I think that at the end of the day the decisions made by the board diversity is irrelevant, but how they are made diversity is relevant."
26D,26D_151,Q,So it’s the process that it’s relevant to?
26D,26D_152,A,"Yeah, but ultimately the decisions are not driven by diversity."
26D,26D_153,Q,What does that mean?
26D,26D_154,A,"Well I think you’ve got a job to do whether you’re – whatever background you have you have a job to do as a director how you exercise your thought process, your morals comes through your background and the more diverse that is the more rounded you are as a cohort.  But ultimately when you’re exercising a decision diversity is not what drives the decision."
26D,26D_155,Q,"I see.  This links back to your point about was it the role, understanding and respect and other people have talked about it’s the goals of the organisation, the strategy, so it’s that filter that the board, whatever that decision’s about, so that’s the common ground that diversity feeds into and surrenders to in the end?"
26D,26D_156,A,"Yeah.  That’s it’s not that when you’re making a decision at board level you’re not making it because you have a certain background, you have to make it before the interest of the organisation."
26D,26D_157,Q,"Yes, so it’s -"
26D,26D_158,A,Otherwise you are not fulfilling your fiduciary duties.
26D,26D_159,Q,You’re bringing an agenda?
26D,26D_16,Q,"And yet that one is about a particular professional group isn’t it, an association for a professional group?"
26D,26D_160,A,Yes.
26D,26D_161,Q,And agenda of diversity is not what this is about.  This is about bringing diversity so that the decision is well considered.
26D,26D_162,A,Well rounded.  Correct.  Correct.
26D,26D_163,Q,"Okay, that is really good.  Could you please highlight that section for me?  I’m just saying that to the transcriber because that’s a neat distinction thing.  Any idea – can you remember a situation or have you experienced a situation where conflict arose that you thought was because of diversity?  Perhaps mismanaged diversity?"
26D,26D_164,A,"Not really, no.  Boards I’ve had the privilege of serving on have been really well functioning and respectful.  So no conflict has arisen."
26D,26D_165,Q,"So we’re specifically focus now on cognitive diversity, do you feel that – that’s a different way of thinking – do you feel that cognitive diversity influences your board’s functioning?  You’ve said – you’ve already said it does, yeah.  We won’t go – and how might cognitive diversity be identified?  For example, when you’re selecting board members?  I think you’ve covered it or is there anything -?"
26D,26D_166,A,I think that’s through the interview stage.
26D,26D_167,Q,And the skills matrix.
26D,26D_168,A,Yeah.
26D,26D_169,Q,"So that’s that process you described.  Yes, you’ve said that.  Did the boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing on building its diversity?"
26D,26D_17,A,Both were.
26D,26D_170,A,No.
26D,26D_171,Q,"No external barriers, no professional, no legal, no regulatory?"
26D,26D_172,A,"No, not that I can think of."
26D,26D_173,Q,"Social, cultural?"
26D,26D_174,A,"No, we embrace both of those.  Boards we embrace diversity.  There was no reasons why we couldn’t consider candidates from quite a broad range of backgrounds."
26D,26D_175,Q,"I suppose the barrier that was present was that agenda diversity, lack of it, and you really became the magnet, the champion that opened the field.  So you – that I suppose was a turning point?  There was a barrier, cultural barrier?"
26D,26D_176,A,"Yes, but the board now that’s not an issue.  And they consciously consider that when they’re looking at the makeup of the board."
26D,26D_177,Q,Have you contributed to that?
26D,26D_178,A,Oh yes.  But everybody on the board did.
26D,26D_179,Q,Were you the prompt for it?  Would it have happened otherwise?
26D,26D_18,Q,And different backgrounds even though it’s for a particular professional group.
26D,26D_180,A,"No, I don’t think I was the prompt for it, but I was one of the prompts."
26D,26D_181,Q,"Targets and talk about it in the meeting, all that, was that a prompt?"
26D,26D_182,A,Perhaps subconsciously but not directly.
26D,26D_183,Q,AICD? [inaudible] 00:50:27
26D,26D_184,A,"Again, subconsciously, I don’t think it’s certainly that – we haven’t said, “Well, this is what they say, so we must follow it” but all of those things are taken – they just -"
26D,26D_185,Q,Awareness.
26D,26D_186,A,"Yeah.  It’s just general awareness and a desire to – and a unified belief that a diverse board is a better board.  So on both of those boards there was a unified belief.  So it wasn’t one person driving this agenda, it was quite – it was a consensus board that this was where we needed to be."
26D,26D_187,Q,"Excellent.  And I guess we – the leadership programs then – I know that you said they’re in the banks but I gather they’re part of the broader – the pipeline for your boards, is it?  Is there a connection that way?"
26D,26D_188,A,"Yes.  Yeah, there is but mainly I think that example was about what other organisations are doing."
26D,26D_189,Q,What does your organisation do to cultivate candidates from different backgrounds?
26D,26D_19,A,Yes.  Yes.
26D,26D_190,A,"Well what it does is sets the criteria, so when board – when they’re looking for board members there will be the criteria settled by the Nominations Committee and that comes down to that skills matrix so that they are very – they would say they’d look at all the exiting board members and say this is their attributes and their skills and this is what we need for the board, where have we got gaps and that’s what we’re looking for.  So again it comes back to making sure that that skills matrix is really quite broad."
26D,26D_191,Q,It is key isn’t it?  I’m seeing this as more – I first heard of skills matrix and I thought oh yeah it’s a tool but I’m now starting to see it as more as a deeper phenomena because it’s – it’s changing the rules of the game.
26D,26D_192,A,"Yeah.  Well they’re positive attributes where years and years ago anecdotally you would say well if somebody went to the right club and the right school that was all they needed to be able to perform the role, to get on the board and of some of our major companies.  Where nowadays one would hope that it’s a little bit more sophisticated, that that – yeah they might have gone to the right school, they might go to the right clubs but fundamentally they have to have the skills to be a director.  Because if they don’t and something goes wrong then they will be prosecuted, there’s significant responsibilities that goes with the title of director and if they’re breached they have significant and real consequences.  So people, I think, have to be more aware that it isn’t just a mate’s club anymore."
26D,26D_193,Q,"Do you think that call for accountability when did it become quite tight: the regulation, the liability for -?"
26D,26D_194,A,It’s – as lots of things it’s just been progressive but the requirements have always been in the law but it’s certainly -
26D,26D_195,Q,Tightened.
26D,26D_196,A,"- the expectations of directors duties have been more focussed, I think, certainly since the GFC but even after the last big recession that Australia had in the 1990s that was when people said well if you’re going to be a director you have to make sure you equip yourself right because if you don’t you’re going to be held accountable.  Particularly where there is any large corporate failures, it’s always “what were the directors doing”."
26D,26D_197,Q,"Yeah, we had OneTel back then, didn’t we?"
26D,26D_198,A,"Yeah, OneTel."
26D,26D_199,Q,"And then HIH later, major."
26D,26D_2,Q,"No, that’s alright.  It’s been going around."
26D,26D_20,Q,Can you tell me why is diversity important in that context?  It’s a bit different.
26D,26D_200,A,"Yeah, and people look at those and say, “Well what were the directors doing?  What were their skills?  Were they looking at the financial statements?   Did they understand the financial statements?”.  Well if you haven’t got any skills in that area it’s hard to demonstrate that you could actually read a set of financial statements and understand what they were meaning, let alone as the questions."
26D,26D_201,Q,The relevant questions.
26D,26D_202,A,Yeah.
26D,26D_203,Q,The skills matrix when did that become pretty standard use of a skills matrix?
26D,26D_204,A,I would think in the last 10 years but maybe a bit less.  But if you’re talking to any of the recruiters they would be able to tell you a bit more.  But I’m thinking five to ten years.
26D,26D_205,Q,I’ll try and find a precise number for that because I actually underestimated the importance of it.
26D,26D_206,A,I think it’s really important.  I’m not quite sure how widely used it is.
26D,26D_207,Q,It’s widely used.
26D,26D_208,A,It should be.
26D,26D_209,Q,It’s widely used but it’s funny because you’re the one who has shown me the strategic value of it rather than as a – so thank you.  I’m conscious of the time.  Do you -?  From a regulatory perspective how do you feel about the way diversity on Australian boards is currently being promoted?
26D,26D_21,A,Diversity’s important -
26D,26D_210,A,From a regulatory perspective?
26D,26D_211,Q,Softer gender targets and quota – and firmer as quotas to influence board diversity for example?
26D,26D_212,A,Sorry I didn’t get that.
26D,26D_213,Q,Sorry.  The use of targets and quotas for example.
26D,26D_214,A,"Okay.  Look I think they’re good goals to have but as I said ultimately I think it’s important that the best people are put in those very responsible positions.  So they’re good goals but I don’t think that they’re – they necessarily should be hard targets.  And I know that there’s lots of schools of thought because I have these debates with my friends about well you need to have a target because if you don’t you’ll never get there.  But I do always worry that we can’t have that trade-off.  The roles are too important, we can’t have that trade-off that we have lesser quality people just purely to make up the numbers."
26D,26D_215,Q,"That’s really good.  Need to avoid creating that trade off which you talked about the conflict, creating a conflict between the roles – the tasks – the skills you need and what’s a good skills versus diversity.  If you create that with quotas for example then you’ve got a problem for the board."
26D,26D_216,A,"Correct.  But it is making sure, I suppose, that that selection process that you’ve got people who are prepared to have an open mind about diversity without thinking they all have to come from this particular pot and then ensuring that the people that are put up do have good skills, and if they don’t then the organisation needs to invest in leadership programs so that they provide a pathway and in the future of people with appropriate skills."
26D,26D_217,Q,"Brilliant.  Excellent.  Do you think there’s a kind of diversity that’s important but really hard to measure, hard to monitor?"
26D,26D_218,A,Can you give me an example?
26D,26D_219,Q,"Well I’m thinking of the sort of character stuff you talked about for example that comes up in interviews, the type of person which is the fit with the board."
26D,26D_22,Q,Background.
26D,26D_220,A,"Hard to measure: look I’m probably not the best person to answer that question.  I think that there is all sorts of tools that they use when they – those – they can do character assessments and personality profiling and all those sorts of things that they do nowadays.  So I think if they want to they can mission nearly everything, whether it works out is another thing."
26D,26D_221,Q,"Finally, the final question: looking 10 years into the future how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
26D,26D_222,A,"I would love to think that we’re not even talking about diversity, that it just happens, that it’s just a given and that we don’t even have to be talking about targets or quotas or be surprised that we have diverse boards because it should be the norm.  That’s what I’d really like."
26D,26D_223,Q,We have no unconscious bias in that world.
26D,26D_224,A,"Yeah, exactly."
26D,26D_225,Q,"Thank you so much, that’s really good.  We are on the hour."
26D,26D_226,A,Wonderful.
26D,26D_227,Q,We did it.
26D,26D_23,A,"Yeah, it’s important because you get a – if you look at one of the boards it’s the membership based which is akin to the shareholders, but the membership base is very diverse and you need to have a board that reflects the membership otherwise it perhaps doesn’t understand or relate to its members.  So I think we certainly have, when they look at the skills matrix for that board I think that they look at all the different cohorts in the membership and try to ensure that they – that people have a connection to the various cohorts."
26D,26D_24,Q,Right.  Are the members all of the same professional background?
26D,26D_25,A,"They’re all accountants, yeah."
26D,26D_26,Q,So all the board members are they all accountants?
26D,26D_27,A,No.  The bulk are.  But there are two independent non-member directors.  And again that’s just to ensure that we have a breadth of knowledge and are not totally inward focussing.
26D,26D_28,Q,Right.  Would one of those be a lawyer?
26D,26D_29,A,There are some not practicing lawyer but they would have a legal background.
26D,26D_3,A,I know.
26D,26D_30,Q,Legal background.  And the other background is that’s considered important?
26D,26D_31,A,Financial services.
26D,26D_32,Q,And that’s – is that because it’s associated with the profession?
26D,26D_33,A,Yes.
26D,26D_34,Q,So it’s like a customer?
26D,26D_35,A,"Yeah, and also because it is adjunct to what some of our members do.  They are very active in that financial services area."
26D,26D_36,Q,"Thank you, that’s good, that’s great, ta.  Now you mentioned – so let’s follow on from that – about when – first of all how long ago were you the first female on the organisation?"
26D,26D_37,A,"That one, that would have been over 10 years ago."
26D,26D_38,Q,"Over 10, oh good, so like 2008?"
26D,26D_39,A,Could have been longer than that.  Might have been -
26D,26D_4,Q,"Okay, well, thank you very much, 26D, for agreeing to participate in the research.  We’re going to talk about diversity of Australian boards, and there’s been a lot of research in this area, but we’re looking specifically at Australian boards, and we’re going to the field, we’re going to people who sit on boards and institutions and organisations that influence people on boards, here in Australia, to gain an understanding of what it means and how it’s managed.  So that’s basically what we’re looking at."
26D,26D_40,Q,Seven?
26D,26D_41,A,"I’m just trying to think, probably mid 2000s I would have thought."
26D,26D_42,Q,Like 2005 roughly?
26D,26D_43,A,Yeah.
26D,26D_44,Q,"Five, first female.  Beautiful.  And the profession that it represents would that be 50% women in it?"
26D,26D_45,A,No.  No.
26D,26D_46,Q,Less?  More?
26D,26D_47,A,It’s heavily male dominated.
26D,26D_48,Q,So to get an equal proportion of women on the board -
26D,26D_49,A,"Well, that is – the [Segay] 00:07:34 board’s got equal representation of women.  There’s that – the membership of CPA is almost 50/50, particularly with new members, it’s 50/50 gender.  [Arete’s] 00:07:51 membership was predominately male.  It just seems to be that a lot of – not a lot of women went into the insolvency field.  There’s a few more now but they still struggle for gender balance in that industry, in that profession."
26D,26D_5,A,Sure.
26D,26D_50,Q,So do you think the board is leading that tendency or influence?  So if it was a more diverse board it would result in -?
26D,26D_51,A,I think the fact that the board has been more diverse of recent years is one of the mechanisms that we have at [Arete] into implemented to foster the growth of women in that profession.
26D,26D_52,Q,"See that’s really good because often people talk in the pipeline as one-way process where it’s people in the field or management in the organisation, it needs to be diverse in order to feed the board.  But you’re saying you’re getting a diverse board in order to cultivate more diversity within the field."
26D,26D_53,A,Yeah because it’s leading by example.  I’m a strong believer of that.
26D,26D_54,Q,"Excellent, thank you.  So how important do you think diversity is: let’s say 10’s extremely important and one is not important at all?"
26D,26D_55,A,I think it’s 10.
26D,26D_56,Q,And do you feel that it’s always been important?  To you has it always been important?
26D,26D_57,A,"It’s about always been important to me.  And I think that might be because I have been part of a minority group and can see how it was – when I – for me doing what I did in insolvency was considered to be, at the time, quite ground breaking and a lot of younger insolvency practitioners, both male and female, have, at times, really said they appreciated the hard yards because it was very – it would have been so much easier for me not to keep pushing to achieve what I achieved in some respects.  But that wasn’t me so – and then I – and because I believed that and I think others then have the courage to say, “Well if she can do it I can to” and as a consequence there’s been quite a change.  Still a long way to go but quite a change."
26D,26D_58,A,"But I just think diversity is important because you – boards need to ensure that they don’t suffer from group think.  And if you get a whole bunch of people who are all very similar and all nod around the table they never challenge one another, they never – they don’t bring different ways of thinking or different thoughts.  And I welcome the fact that I can attend – I can go about my board duties, have read all my papers, have formed a view in my own mind – not that I’m easily swayed – but I can hear what someone else has said and think to myself I hadn’t turned my mind to that and is there merit in what they’re saying.  Or I can turn around and say no that’s just garbage, I still don’t believe.  Still I think my view is the right view but if I haven’t got that – if we’re all of the same view all the time on everything – you have to have harmony on a board but – and you can’t always be challenging everything but on the important things you have to be able to have critical thinking and if you – diversity encourages that."
26D,26D_59,Q,"Look I’m really – there’s two points I really want to pick up there: one is that conflict, how to manage that, how’s that managed so that it’s productive; and the other is how recruiting tensions possibly between that culture of the board so as it can be productive and group think.  So you recruit for diversity but there’s a risk of creating too much conflict in the board, so there’s sort of – connect with each other.  Could you -?"
26D,26D_6,Q,"So you mentioned that you’re on two boards, they’re both in the financial area.  Are they listed?"
26D,26D_60,A,"I think it’s looking at characters, people’s characters.  There are people who have extreme views and are quite polarising and become antagonistic, and that’s not healthy for a board and not healthy for the organisation which the board serves.  But if you have people who bring an enquiring mind to the role, understand their responsibilities and can have the maturity and the respect around the table to be able to discuss an issue and not be offended that somebody’s view is different then that’s a really well functioning board."
26D,26D_61,A,"And in some respects the chair can play a big role in that because if the chair shuts down anytime someone says, “Could I please ask this question” and the chair says, “No, we’ve dealt with it move on” time and time and time again it takes a very strong character to say, “No, actually I want to discuss this”.  So the chair is really pivotal in ensuring that there is a board that can explore and discuss, unpack important issues.  And invariably in my experience I’ve found as a consequence of doing that we do get a consensus and in most of the time it is unanimous but it’s not without having gone through that process."
26D,26D_62,Q,Right.  Have you ever struck a lack of respect on the board where you’ve felt a different view was -?
26D,26D_63,A,"No, not on the – not of recent times.  And when I first jointed the [Arete] board it was – it was a bit autocratic in as much as the chair was very strong and their view was their view and no-one else is really entitled to a view.  But that didn’t last about that long now with us so I think that was just a hang up of what how it used to be and they probably didn’t even realise that they were like that.  But then the more confidence you get the more you – if you – I think each director has a responsibility to ensure that that does not happen."
26D,26D_64,Q,"Right.  So the culture – it’s the same chair, so the chair learnt because the board changed as more people came on from different perspectives?"
26D,26D_65,A,Yes.
26D,26D_66,Q,"It’s a bit like kids educating the parents about respect for difference, whatever.  Okay so the culture was transferred.  That’s good because some people just refer to the chair and I’m thinking well this is a one-way street again but clearly you’re showing how a diverse board will cultivate the chair.  And if the chair doesn’t respond have you heard of, experienced the chair being removed?"
26D,26D_67,A,"I have not, no.  But I think – I think a properly functioning board does reviews the board and reviews peer reviews, so you review not only your performance but others review your performance and the chair is one of those people that the board will review.  So it will become pretty clear that they’re not – they don’t have the support of the rest of the board and I think they either will understand that they need to change or that a change will need to occur."
26D,26D_68,Q,"I’m intrigued how – let’s say the chair is obstinate and is blocking that reform, that process, how – there’s no-one above the chair is there who can -?"
26D,26D_69,A,No.
26D,26D_7,A,No.
26D,26D_70,Q,The chair can do it to the CEO but -?
26D,26D_71,A,I think it’s – but then the board will just say that they don’t support the chair.  So it would be the board again not revolting against the chair but it would be the board joining together to say it’s not appropriate.
26D,26D_72,Q,So a democratic process?
26D,26D_73,A,Yes.
26D,26D_74,Q,"Okay.  Good.  And the other thing was the tension, when bringing on new people, new members to the board the potential tension between on the one hand avoiding group think but on the other avoiding people who might disrupt the processes of the board."
26D,26D_75,A,Can you give me an example?  What do you mean by that?
26D,26D_76,Q,"So this is not from experience, this is from literature: there can be conflict, so there’s a concern: one concern is that diverse boards there can be more conflict.  So this is to this point about antagonism, passive resistance to different points of view creating resentment, disrespect, that sort of thing.  So if you’ve got someone perceived to be too different, their point of view too different it can create tension.  So you want to avoid group think, you want different ways of thinking but you also want to have a productive board.  So this is a recruitment challenge."
26D,26D_77,A,"It is, definitely."
26D,26D_78,Q,I’m just wondering how that’s managed?
26D,26D_79,A,"I think in the first instance it’s really important to get the skills matrix right so that you can be clear the skills that you are seeking and those skills and attributes can’t be oh well we need someone with a legal background full stop.  It has to be broader than that, hence the term “matrix”.  So you identify what you’re looking for and then part of the process also needs, as I said, to look at the personal attributes of the individual as to how they will fit in with the board, and whether they are someone who is strong enough character wise to be able to hold their position on important issues but not be belligerent.  Because belligerent – someone that’s belligerent isn’t acting in the interest of the organisation.  They – a director has a fiduciary duty to organisations to act in its best interests.  Always being belligerent, the one that never agrees with anything no matter how much sense it makes they’re not acting in the interest of the organisation.  One would have to say they’re perhaps acting in self-interest and that’s not what a director should do."
26D,26D_8,Q,They’re non-listed companies?
26D,26D_80,Q,"Good.  So how do you assess that, that person’s -?"
26D,26D_81,A,"It’s through the interview process, the screening I suppose, looking at – the applicants all probably look fabulous on paper but it’s getting behind the documentation, checking their references and the interview.  The interview is critical.  And then the panel who interviews is also critical as to whether again if you have – you’ve got to make sure that you don’t have a panel that’s made up, that is really just looking for people like us.  So you’ve got to have diversity on your panel as well because – and that – I know of some organisations where they will have quite – they will have people from within the organisation on the panel but they’ll also have external people on the panel that have psychology skills, HR skills, those sorts of things that look at things from quite a different perspective from someone who just needs to know whether you’re technically proficient."
26D,26D_82,Q,"Okay so it’s not just a subset of the board, that interview, you go externally and you go within the organisation as well?"
26D,26D_83,A,Yes.
26D,26D_84,Q,"Okay, so then you get quite diverse views.  Good.  No-one’s explained that process or [inaudible] 00:22:04 process of course.  Subcommittees have been mentioned.  Do you think that there’s any situation or context that might cause you to change the importance rating of 10 that you gave it like high risk, high uncertainty, just thinking about your -?"
26D,26D_85,A,"I’m firmly of the view that you have the best people in the role, so whilst I see diversity as really important there may be times where the best people are all female or all male or all from one particular cohort.  So I don’t think that the pursuit of diversity should be – should mean that the people that are chosen are less than the best people for the role."
26D,26D_86,Q,"Okay, good.  Which puts a lot of onus on the recruitment process that it is open to diversity."
26D,26D_87,A,Yes.
26D,26D_88,Q,"Because that’s feeding that. Good.  Otherwise it’s very easy to say well there’s – we just don’t have – the best people in the role happen to be all men in their 50s.  So if your recruitment process, let’s say people select like for like in that the person section, not the skills matrix but the personal characteristics then you’ll find that."
26D,26D_89,A,"Yeah and you’ll have the – this is what we would really like, these skills is what we’d really like, this profile is what we’d really like and then you’d try and find the person with all of those or as close to – close – the person with the most amount of those attributes.  But if at the end of the day your wish list is not able to be met well then you’ve got to start prioritising what are must haves and what are likes."
26D,26D_9,A,Correct.
26D,26D_90,Q,Yeah.  Nice to haves.
26D,26D_91,A,Nice to haves.
26D,26D_92,Q,So as the first woman on this board did you have a mentor?  Did someone encourage you to do this?
26D,26D_93,A,"I’ve had several mentors over my life.  It was – did someone encourage me to do it?  I think it was – no it was an opportunity that came my way and I took it.  So it wasn’t as if I had a plan that I could say well I planned and five years down the track I got there.  It was just a – I suppose it was a series of opportunities that arose when they all joined together, that’s where I ended up.  But it was – and it was being prepared to take the opportunities when they arose."
26D,26D_94,Q,"That’s right.  So now you – then you became a champion so that as you said that I can see that other women will follow, but that initial start that was really like a hero."
26D,26D_95,A,"It was – it was – and I didn’t feel like that at the time and I look back now and I think wow that was really amazing but at the time it was okay I should do this.  And I think the fact that we have been able to grow the number of females on that board is because people realised the benefits of having people like me on the board and that there is – it’s easy for people say you’re the token when you won, but I think that – I don’t think anybody would ever say that I was a token.  And certainly, the ladies that are on the board now are far from tokenistic.  They are strong, strong and worth their seat on the board."
26D,26D_96,Q,That’s a good story.  What does board diversity mean to you?  How do you understand it?
26D,26D_97,A,"Obviously gender, but different – different walks of life, different – different backgrounds.  So you can all have very similar qualifications but you all have travelled different pathways.  And I think that that’s important too because there are various jobs that a board has to attend to and different experiences and different backgrounds, different qualifications mean that those responsibilities can be covered from the board so that you’re not sitting there saying well we’ve got no-one that’s got audit and risk, it’s such an important part of the board but we don’t have got anyone who’s got risk skills or we don’t – nobody has ever read a legal contract and we’re entering into quite – quite detailed contracts but none of us know how to read legal contracts.  So you’ve got to – so it’s – diversity is not just in gender, it is in skills, it is experiences both professionally and even life experiences, different backgrounds, different cultures."
26D,26D_98,Q,"Good.  And what about in terms of – you mentioned knowledge also, inside and outside, so organisational knowledge because when you’re recruiting you have people from within the organisation then external and then on the board, so you have the different – and what’s another?  Problem solving, approaches to problem solving, you mentioned group think.  So some people label ways, different ways of thinking as cognitive diversity and so it’s – but I found that few people use that term.  It must be just in the literate.  Social networks that people have, is that important?"
26D,26D_99,A,"Yeah, because it often helps with stakeholder management.  So I think it is.  Not so much as it needs to be a part of the club, totally against that, but vary it to have a network that you can draw on to at certain times it’s incredibly helpful."
27D correcte,27D correcte_1,Q,"Oh, that's a good time, isn't it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_10,A,"Mm, it's very complicated, isn't it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_100,Q,And so feel safe.
27D correcte,27D correcte_101,A,"So then having said that, I know a lot of the people that are around the table at two Health Boards and there's still not enough diversity of thought, and there's still not enough of what I would call inclusion.  So having the new standard of including consumers, carers and community in partners with the board in driving the strategy forward.  A lot of that is still tick-boxing and that's because of the people that are still around the board."
27D correcte,27D correcte_102,Q,What's the standard?  I don't know this.
27D correcte,27D correcte_103,A,"So there's a new standard as far as the national health care standards, standard 2, where the organisation actually has to show that they are doing things to include, because they found that there are improved health care outcomes if consumers are involved in the decision making around their health.  So a lot of the organisations, because they've been forced to fill the standard, are making a lot of changes, but it's still a lot of what I think is tick-boxing as opposed to real inclusion, and there's a big difference around feedback or input.  So if you want to be around the table when you're doing the input as opposed to feeding back after you've done all the work."
27D correcte,27D correcte_104,A,"So the problem with that is that you can't convince everybody that you can still manage consumers because how I'm treated as a consumer shows me that people are still tick-boxing. When we brought consumers to speak to us, the board members were worried about the consumers and how they were going to manage them. People seem to think consumers are people that have got too much time on their hands and have nothing to do and just want a feeling of self-importance, which is not necessarily true because I'm a consumer but I think that this is a way that I probably can make a difference if I can, then I find that the differences that I'm making are actually slow and may not necessarily be driving the change that I want because some of it is still tick-boxing.  You have feedback as opposed to input."
27D correcte,27D correcte_105,Q,That's really nice.
27D correcte,27D correcte_106,A,"So for me - like, I see it close the loop, if that makes sense, and I don't know that anybody else - like, a lot of other people that have got board positions wouldn't go and volunteer their time.  And this is where Safer Care Victoria are wonderful in that they are driving that it should be a standard and they are driving that organisations should be paying their consumers for their time.  Having said that, there are other consumers that I work with that say they don't want to be paid by the organisation because then they are seen as being paid by the organisation.  They should be paid by Safer Care Victoria as being consumers on organisations, because it still allows them that sense of independence."
27D correcte,27D correcte_107,Q,"So Safer Care Victoria is where the standard comes from, is it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_108,A,Yeah.
27D correcte,27D correcte_109,Q,Because it sounds like ACHS.
27D correcte,27D correcte_11,Q,"It is complicated.  Yeah, yeah.  Very good, very good."
27D correcte,27D correcte_110,A,So Safer Care Victoria was set up as a result of the Duckett Review.
27D correcte,27D correcte_111,Q,"Oh, okay.  This is - yep.  Duckett Review.  I remember that happening."
27D correcte,27D correcte_112,A,A couple of years ago now.
27D correcte,27D correcte_113,Q,Yeah.  A few more now.
27D correcte,27D correcte_114,A,"Yeah, that's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_115,Q,"Yeah, it's quite a while ago, actually."
27D correcte,27D correcte_116,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_117,Q,I haven't been working in the field for a while.
27D correcte,27D correcte_118,A,"Yes.  I think, as a result of the Duckett Review, we got Safer Care Victoria, Better Care Victoria and other ones - working on things as well.  That's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_119,Q,I looked at private health.
27D correcte,27D correcte_12,A,"We need someone to come up with all the answers, I think, but anyway."
27D correcte,27D correcte_120,A,"And isn't it funny, because you - because I have two daughters that are studying medicine and one has been - well, actually, they both have done some of their rotations around public hospitals and around private hospitals and they say you can just see the difference."
27D correcte,27D correcte_121,Q,"It's completely different.  So culturally - I wanted to go back to your point about culture, because culturally they can be very different."
27D correcte,27D correcte_122,A,"Yeah, absolutely they are."
27D correcte,27D correcte_123,Q,"And private can be very different.  But you mentioned culture earlier, like a misalignment of culture, so having someone - so diversity can put at risk that culture.  Can you talk a little about that for me please?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_124,A,"So, for example, if I talk about my experience at a community advisory committee for a health network, we have a bit of diversity at the table from the consumers.  So we have a Spanish lady, we have a lady with a disability, we have me, we used to have an Aboriginal guy or a guy who represented the Aboriginal community and the problem with the Aboriginal community, is that culturally you have to be accepted as part of their community before you can truly represent them, so you can't just go to the community and say, ""We need someone."" So it's really hard to get that diversity at the table."
27D correcte,27D correcte_125,A,"Then when you do bring one person, is that person truly representative of that community or just their own experiences?  For example, we have one person at the table who, ""My neighbour this,"" and, ""My neighbour this,"" but it's the one neighbour that this person is bringing to the table.  How else are they representing that community when you talk about diversity?  It's just one person who doesn't speak English but we don't have anybody that represents, for example, blind people or people hard of hearing or we don't have anybody that's young at the table.  They are all 40-plus.  So how can you even talk about diversity and feeling the culture, because I'm sure the health network doesn't just see 40-plus people that speak English."
27D correcte,27D correcte_126,Q,So how do you think diversity is understood then?  How do you understand diversity?
27D correcte,27D correcte_127,A,"I think everybody understands.  So, for example, at the moment the Department of Human Services has said to all the hospitals they have to have a disability action plan in before the 1st of July and they're all working really hard towards having that in.  So when they've spoken about the disability action plan, they've spoken about diversity and they are talking about people with physical handicaps as well as mental handicaps as well as just being diverse in the LGBTI community, and that's around diversity as well, but when we talk about cultural diversity, I think it's more than just those what I call obvious things.  I think there are things that are nuances.  So, for example - they call it the white elephant in the room, the cultural diversity, and so at CPA Australia, a couple of years ago at congress, I actually chaired one of the sessions, and I wish I could remember what the guy's name was, and he gave me a copy of his book and it was something as little as having a firm handshake in Australia is culturally acceptable but having a firm handshake in some Asian countries is actually seen as a sign of aggression.  So that's a cultural diversity that not everybody would understand.  So how do you include those kind of nuances around the table?  It's like how many people have trouble doing business in China because culturally they address things differently?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_128,A,"I have a friend of mine who works for an IT company and she's trying to do business in the Middle East, and she says the way that they do business there, you actually almost - you have to share a meal, you have to go out together, you have to almost become a social friend before you can do business, because that's the way they learn to trust you around the business table.  So you can stay years and not be paid and stay years and put tenders to them but, if they don't trust you, it just won't move forward anyway."
27D correcte,27D correcte_129,Q,And you have to pay for the meals?
27D correcte,27D correcte_13,Q,Yeah.  Are you going to have space in aged care?  Is that a big space for you?
27D correcte,27D correcte_130,A,"No, no, no, they're very generous of spirit.  They're very hospitable.  They're very hospitable, but you have to get yourself there."
27D correcte,27D correcte_131,Q,"And there's a sort of power issue, because how comfortable do you feel if someone's always buying you meals and then you're putting in a tender?  It's sort of -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_132,A,That's right.  Are you indirectly being bribed?
27D correcte,27D correcte_133,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  What if it's a car next time?  Interesting, isn't it?  Okay.  So when we come back to boards, so then that's cultural diversity.  It's complex."
27D correcte,27D correcte_134,A,"It's very complex, but then how do you - and then should you just - because then you need to look at your demographics and really have diversity of your demographics at the board table.  So it would be no good for me, for example, being in - and just as an example - being in Toorak and thinking that I shouldn't have any white middle-aged men on board.  Or somebody was saying around the election that in the City of Kooyong you will always have people voting for the Greens because that's where all the doctors' wives live, and they're all the ones that are do-gooders and think about the environment, so you will always have a Green vote there."
27D correcte,27D correcte_135,A,"So, I mean, you know, it would be stupid to put a - what do you call it - a young Muslim boy in Kew, for example.  And that's just using a -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_136,Q,"An extreme example, and that's if it's a service industry -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_137,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_138,Q,- that's got a targeted community.
27D correcte,27D correcte_139,A,"That's right, that's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_14,A,"Well, we're thinking about it, only because a lot of the aged care is lumped in with the NDIS."
27D correcte,27D correcte_140,Q,"But if it was a - you know, one of [unclear] 00:30:26"
27D correcte,27D correcte_141,A,BHP.
27D correcte,27D correcte_142,Q,"Yeah, BHP, how do you get the demographics then?  And they're a worldwide country.  What do you do?  Is it relevant?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_143,A,"You have to get someone from - yeah, that's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_144,Q,"Is it relevant, the demographics then?  The demographic diversity?  Is that relevant?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_145,A,"Well, you know, if they were going to, for example - like Exxon Valdez, when they had that whole oil problem, then it would have been very important to have somebody from that area on that board.  So then do they then just have a working group or do they have someone on the board for that time?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_146,Q,"Well, you can't pre-empt all disasters, I guess."
27D correcte,27D correcte_147,A,"No, that's right.  But if they had someone on the board, they would have said, ""Oh, look, you know, what are you doing there?  This is people's land.""  You know, there would have been - even when, for example -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_148,Q,[unclear] 00:31:11
27D correcte,27D correcte_149,A,"[unclear] 00:31:11.  So even if you have a look at what's happening in Geelong around the people that are all getting cancer and they're saying, ""Okay, there's something in the land there.""  So I'm really pleased to see that people's voices have been heard and that there is an investigation going on, but it really took too many people to die and speak up for it to happen, because it sounds like it's been there for more than 20 years."
27D correcte,27D correcte_15,Q,So you do NDIS?
27D correcte,27D correcte_150,Q,"And death is a pretty extreme indicator, isn't it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_151,A,"Look at what happened at Djerriwarrh.  I mean, you know, they had to have how many babies for them to see - and I'm thinking, 'Okay, well did nobody ever do a check on this guy?  What's going on?'  Like, the basic processes are falling through.  So then you look at okay, even if you had diversity."
27D correcte,27D correcte_152,Q,"So there was a bullying culture underpinning - like, this is the story of safety and quality and health care and the bullying culture.  So with wards, culture - you know, the relationship between the organisational culture and the board culture and then the culture of the board.  So you were talking about culture mismatches, because I'm thinking well you've got group think on one side, one extreme, and then you've got the problems of cultural misalignment on the other.  So can you talk a little about that for me?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_153,A,"For me, I think it's actually - I don't want to say a bigger problem but you need strong people to lead.  At what point, then, do they become so strong that they're like bullies as opposed to actually leading, and then what does leading actually mean for people?  For some people, leading means leading from behind where you strengthen your team and you move together.  For some people, leaders is being the head figure where you are the voice, and so you're telling everybody what to do.  So then how do you train people for leadership to then set the culture?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_154,Q,And managing diversity.
27D correcte,27D correcte_155,A,Yeah.  So this is why I'm actually really -
27D correcte,27D correcte_156,Q,It's good to bring leadership up in -
27D correcte,27D correcte_157,A,"Mm.  And this is why, because I look at our - so if I look back to the history of our organisation, for example, when we stepped - oh well, I shouldn't say fired.  When we accepted the previous CEO - the bullying CEO's resignation, the new CEO that we interviewed - around the board, we had agreed that what we needed was an amicable CEO to help the organisation heal to move forward, so that's what we interviewed for: a person that would be able to bring people back together and get them working as a team again."
27D correcte,27D correcte_158,A,Then we went through the merger and the other organisation that we merged with had a CEO that was a micromanager.  So we had the two CEOs were at either end of the spectrum.  The guy that was amicable couldn't make the hard calls to fire anybody that wasn't performing and this CEO was micromanaging people so much that they didn't feel that they could actually get their job done.
27D correcte,27D correcte_159,A,"So when we interviewed this time, we thought well, we need somebody that's going to be able to do both, and that's a very hard call because, in general, people are not filling all those shoes.  So when we interviewed this guy, we asked him what his plan was, and his plan was - and I think, to me, having come from a management accounting background as opposed to a financial accounting background, I could see the processes that he was doing where he was going to have a look at the organisation, do a gap analysis, try and train people up that would accept that, performance manage people that weren't going to come on the journey, because the organisation now was double the size what it was, so you needed people at the top level to be performing at a better stage and then to bring the staff with them, and, because the organisation is bigger, you have to recognise what your own capacity is."
27D correcte,27D correcte_16,A,Very heavily NDIS.  We were one of the first organisations to roll out NDIS when it first came in.
27D correcte,27D correcte_160,A,"Can you actually be on the ground with that 500-plus staff now or do you have to manage that through your executive team, and so that's what he's doing and this is why I'm really happy with this choice that we've made because he is making the calls of what he can and can't do, outsourcing where he can't but getting good plans from the people that he's outsourcing from and it is being driven from the ground, and so he is addressing the culture of what I call mateship as opposed to performance.  So I'm not going to - what do you call it - promote you just because you're my mate anymore.  I'm going to promote you because this is the criteria I'm looking for, and he's addressing that from the ground up."
27D correcte,27D correcte_161,Q,"And the board's used this process itself to shape itself, yes?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_162,A,"So the board has consciously chosen a person that we felt could do both because we needed to move the organisation forward because we recognised that this is what was happening previously, and what I love about this new CEO is that he has actually gone and had a cup of coffee with every single board member to, I suppose, see in his mind that we're all on the same page as well."
27D correcte,27D correcte_163,Q,Okay.  So you've got a really good bridge builder and leader -
27D correcte,27D correcte_164,A,"And leader, absolutely."
27D correcte,27D correcte_165,Q,"- in this man, and this was a - you analysed the board, the merged board - analysed what it needed to merge -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_166,A,Yeah.
27D correcte,27D correcte_167,Q,- and he fits that bill -
27D correcte,27D correcte_168,A,Yes.
27D correcte,27D correcte_169,Q,"- and the board - you all went through a selection process.  You all have a similar - like, you've got a congruent approach to that CEO, yeah?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_17,Q,"That gives me a sense of context.  So, we'll start formally the interview now.  So there's a lot of talk about board diversity in the literature and whatever, except what we want to do is look at it from an Australian context and from the ground up.  So we're interviewing people who are directors on boards in organisations that influence boards in Australia of all types.  So thank you so much for agreeing to the interview.  We've got all that.  You sit on two boards, don't you?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_170,A,"So when we interviewed - we used a recruitment agency, obviously, and all the board members were given the ability - so we have a governance committee who is in charge of basically doing the operational work around getting the CEO or doing the groundwork and then it comes to the board and we all decide, but the chair of the governance committee was very transparent at every stage and we all had the opportunity to give, I suppose, four or five qualities that we saw were most important for the CEO, and then, from that, we did a tally and then agreed to what we all wanted or what we felt was a priority, because obviously no one can fill all 10 of your priorities anyway, and then, from there, when it came down to - obviously we did a job description and then the recruitment agency said to us, ""Look, these are the candidates."""
27D correcte,27D correcte_171,A,"So the governance committee, I suppose, culled till it got to about four and then gave everyone the opportunity to come and be present for the interviewing of these guys, or candidates.  And we didn't all agree that this was the person that we wanted initially until we had a discussion around the table that - and we didn't actually say this is what the organisation needed as much as, because we'd already agreed that these were the priorities that we wanted, did that person fit the bill?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_172,A,"So each candidate was given the same brief: come with a quick plan as to how you would address.  This guy was the one who came most prepared.  Actually visited a couple of the sites, looked at the website, and actually said, ""These are the issues I think that you've got.  This is my plan for dealing with them,"" and actually came with a strategic plan of how he was going to move forward, and he was the only one that did that."
27D correcte,27D correcte_173,Q,Very good.  Very proactive.  And wanted the job.  That's great.  Motivated.
27D correcte,27D correcte_174,A,"Sure.  Absolutely.  There was one person that I initially thought, 'Okay, this guy's already a CEO of another community health service.  You know, better the devil you know than the friend you don't.""  And that was the person that I initially thought we would get him to fit in because he was coming to the same thing.  And when he came to the interview - it's not that he didn't want the job; he just was not as dynamic or energetic.  It wasn't even enthusiasm.  It was dynamic, energetic.  It was like yes, he knew he could do it, and for him it really just meant that he was going to be CEO of a bigger organisation."
27D correcte,27D correcte_175,Q,"Yeah, the next step."
27D correcte,27D correcte_176,A,"That's right.  But he didn't show me anything as far as having a strategic plan of how he was going to move it forward.  It was really just going to be more of the same of what he'd been doing at that organisation as opposed to, I suppose, doing a gap analysis of what the new merged organisation needed, and I think probably two other people around the table had that change of mind as well."
27D correcte,27D correcte_177,Q,So let's hope - how long's the CEO been in the position?
27D correcte,27D correcte_178,A,Since January.
27D correcte,27D correcte_179,Q,That's great.  First budget.
27D correcte,27D correcte_18,A,"Well, no.  This is the only board I sit on.  I'm on the advisory council at a Health Ombudsman and I'm also on the advisory council at a health network as a consumer advisor. So although they are both board subcommittees, they're not really boards, so this is the only board one that I do."
27D correcte,27D correcte_180,A,"Absolutely first budget.  And the CFO's father passed away and she's gone to India to see him, so we've had to delay everything till she comes back."
27D correcte,27D correcte_181,Q,"Yeah, that's right.  [It's just a she] 00:41:25."
27D correcte,27D correcte_182,A,"Yes, yeah, that's right.  There's been so many hes that we've been talking about."
27D correcte,27D correcte_183,Q,That's right.  That's exactly right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_184,A,"But you know what?  Funnily enough, I sometimes think that - and not because I'm being sexist by any stretch of the imagination.  Sometimes having a male CEO is good in a female environment because calls it black and white, doesn't - what do you call it - pander to some females' antics.  There could be male antics as well.  We used to have a director of nursing who was a male.  He was gay but he was so high maintenance.  So you don't necessarily have to be a female but unfortunately, when there's a lot of females in one place, there seems to be a lot more drama."
27D correcte,27D correcte_185,Q,So you need diversity.
27D correcte,27D correcte_186,A,Absolutely need diversity.
27D correcte,27D correcte_187,Q,Gender diversity.
27D correcte,27D correcte_188,A,Absolutely need [unclear] 00:42:28.  So the same as having a lot of middle-aged men around the table is not good; having a lot of middle-aged women or young women or whatever isn't good either.  You definitely need diversity.
27D correcte,27D correcte_189,Q,Yeah.  So gender diversity is good.
27D correcte,27D correcte_19,Q,"Okay.  So first, how has the composition of boards that you're familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_190,A,"Very important, yeah."
27D correcte,27D correcte_191,Q,Regardless of the situation.
27D correcte,27D correcte_192,A,Absolutely.
27D correcte,27D correcte_193,Q,Merger.  High risk.
27D correcte,27D correcte_194,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_195,Q,High uncertainty.
27D correcte,27D correcte_196,A,Exactly.  I would love to see a female CEO.  Love to see it.
27D correcte,27D correcte_197,Q,"So we want to get a handle on how diversity influences board functioning.  So you've talked about if there's too many women.  So if there's lack of gender diversity, you've mentioned the female aspect.  And the male aspect is nepotism, self-interest."
27D correcte,27D correcte_198,A,"But females as well.  I can name a few females.  Being with women on boards.  I went to a lot of, I suppose, director PD, and a lot of the times, whether it was AICD or women on boards or anywhere else, some of the women that are on boards are not collaborative women.  They are quite competitive and very self-interest as well."
27D correcte,27D correcte_199,Q,"So does that have a place, do you think, that sort of personality, that trait?  Is that something that you'd want as part of a diverse board or is that something that's universally dreadful?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_2,A,"Yeah.  2011, and what we've done is we actually merged with another organisation, and I made it through the second round of interviews to actually get through to the merged organisation.  It's been wonderful to see the growth of the organisation but, in this instance, it's been wonderful to be part of the selection of the CEO as well, which was - I'm so happy with this guy."
27D correcte,27D correcte_20,A,"I believe, unfortunately, there's not enough diversity around the board table.  It is changing and, in health care, you would think that you would see more females because traditionally more females work in health care, but that's not necessarily the case, but it is changing."
27D correcte,27D correcte_200,A,"I think it's universally dreadful.  Self-interest is universally dreadful.  It's got to be the interest of the organisation and the community it serves, so not really just the organisation.  There's more social responsibility now than there ever was and it should have always been that way in my opinion, because it's through diversity, through education that community prospers, and those two being missing means we're just at a standstill."
27D correcte,27D correcte_201,Q,"And you can't be responsible more broadly.  So the banks, BHP, your local community service."
27D correcte,27D correcte_202,A,"And I don't want to - I mean, the most simple example I can give you is if you have proactive parents and non-proactive parents and the results that could possibly happen for the children and their future.  Sometimes the children themselves just develop their own skills and become proactive anyway, but predominantly having proactive parents that are actually for the welfare of the children as opposed to themselves will actually have children that think about their community and will want to do things for the global world and all that kind of thing, whereas parents, when they're - you know, it's all about me and you guys are just a by-product of my marriage, is like okay, you're not really instilling the right kind of values in those kids, and it just begets that kind of pattern."
27D correcte,27D correcte_203,Q,Narcissism.
27D correcte,27D correcte_204,A,"Yes.  Well, yes, it happens around the board.  And in organisations.  So it's not just a board thing.  It's also an executive thing."
27D correcte,27D correcte_205,Q,"With your talk of culture, you didn't separate board and exec.  You sort of see them quite one?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_206,A,"Because they work together.  You know, the exec can work without the board but can lose direction unless the CEO is a strategic person, and the board - well, they'll have nothing to do unless they've got somebody to tell what to do."
27D correcte,27D correcte_207,A,"Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So they [unclear] 00:46:23."
27D correcte,27D correcte_208,Q,An effective collaboration.
27D correcte,27D correcte_209,A,That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_21,Q,So you've been around since 2011.  So you've been watching the space for eight years -
27D correcte,27D correcte_210,Q,"Yeah, so if they were competing with each other or hiding - you know, not open?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_211,A,But isn't that what used to happen?
27D correcte,27D correcte_212,Q,Absolutely.  Absolutely.
27D correcte,27D correcte_213,A,"Literally, CEOs thought that they were the boss and they tell the board what to do and then boards are now saying, ""No, we're the boss and we tell you what to do,"" but more and more it is more apparent that it's about a collaboration.  It's like okay, this is where we'd like to see the organisation go forward and the CEO says, ""We don't have resources to do that so we have to compromise on that.  This is where we can go and maybe we make that a long-term plan,"" so it's more about collaboration."
27D correcte,27D correcte_214,Q,"That's good.  No one's brought that point up.  That's a really neat one and it shows that that culture of the board really needs to be one of a team player as well, otherwise it's unidirectional and that's not effective, is what you're saying."
27D correcte,27D correcte_215,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_216,Q,"So that's good.  Are there particular board functions that diversity can really help with then around this - because we now need to think about how diversity influences board functioning.  You've just said if there's not an effective collaboration between the board and the CEO and the exec team, then you're going to have problems with strategy and everything.  So are there other board functions that diversity can really help with or is that the main one?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_217,A,"Yeah well, as far as driving the organisation forward.  So if we all thought that we should just stay where we are and just keep the status quo, then there's not going to be really growth, even though the world around us is growing.  So there needs to be diversity as far as having strategy and there also needs to be diversity as far as recognising opportunity, because not everybody sees opportunity either.  Some people are just naturally born with seeing those kind of things.  Like, my husband has this unbelievable or this uncanny ability to see that this is where something should be.  I remember 30 years ago we were driving past a place and he said to me, ""You know, this place here.  Perfect for a family medical practice.""  Without fail, within five years there was a family medical practice and it's thriving and it's still there 30 years later."
27D correcte,27D correcte_218,A,"What do you call it?  There's another place where he said, ""Look at this.  There's a secondary school, a kindergarten and a primary school.  You know what's missing?  Childcare.  So we actually built a childcare and it's still going, because it's just in that - so he has this ability to see it that somebody else may not even notice it.  So if you have people with different skills at the table, it just gives greater opportunity for everything."
27D correcte,27D correcte_219,Q,"I can see - and this links with some other directors that have talked about in risk management it's really important to have diversity, because just like your husband could see the opportunities, he would see, ""Oh gee, there's a real risk here because no one has anywhere for their children, so what will happen to the children?"" or something like that."
27D correcte,27D correcte_22,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_220,A,"Yeah.  Yes, that's right, that's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_221,Q,"You know, the gap of the negative side."
27D correcte,27D correcte_222,A,"Yeah, that's right.  That's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_223,Q,Are there board functions that diversity can limit or undermine?  I think you've addressed that.  It's really the personality of board members is important it seems.
27D correcte,27D correcte_224,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_225,Q,That you have to be able to collaborate?
27D correcte,27D correcte_226,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_227,Q,And you've said it's an absolute that they're not narcissistic.  My final question is are there any other board functions which you feel diversity has little bearing on?  Is there anything that diversity has really no bearing on in terms of board functions?
27D correcte,27D correcte_228,A,I don't think so.
27D correcte,27D correcte_229,Q,And conflict and diversity?  Is there an example there?
27D correcte,27D correcte_23,Q,- and you've seen it increasing?
27D correcte,27D correcte_230,A,"So greater diversity can lead to more conflict and so you need to, I suppose, have tools around the table as to how you would manage that.  I did this with - I think AICD ran a session and about dealing with conflict and it was like what if you had a chair that was a bully, then how do you deal with that?  We never actually came up with an answer because having a chair - and again it's that fine line between being strong enough to drive people but still being, I suppose, a leader to allow other people to step up as well.  It's not just about you driving.  It's about giving other people a chance.  Because I remember when we had the day hospital, there was one girl who'd done a Bachelor of Science and she was just really clever and got things, you know."
27D correcte,27D correcte_231,A,"She helped me establish the policies and procedures of the day hospital.  She helped me set up an accounting package so that we could process things electronically as opposed to manually and everything like that, and I said to her, ""Look, have you ever thought about going on and doing a Masters in Healthcare or something like that so that you could have - progress your career.  Don't just be a processor all your life.""  She just was never interested, and no matter how many times I tried to send her to - what do you call it - to professional development to get her to - she just didn't want it, and so then it was up to me to just step back and say I recognise that culturally that was enough for her."
27D correcte,27D correcte_232,Q,Yeah.  That's what she wanted to do.
27D correcte,27D correcte_233,A,"But at least I was running my own business but trying to take her along the journey as well.  It wasn't just about managing my business.  It was about making my staff happy that - even if they didn't stay with me, that they would produce the best work while they were there.  So not everybody is capable of doing that.  So some people - and if I want to give it as an example, I had a friend of mine who was a single mum and, in the end, she was so protective of her daughter that it showed me it was more about her and her role as a mother than seeing that her daughter grew as an individual.  So not all leaders have that capacity to step back and grow other people because it basically threatens their position."
27D correcte,27D correcte_234,Q,So this is helping to get an understanding of the root causes of conflict?
27D correcte,27D correcte_235,A,Yeah.
27D correcte,27D correcte_236,Q,It'll arise because of people's defensiveness or -
27D correcte,27D correcte_237,A,So what they define as leadership traits.
27D correcte,27D correcte_238,Q,"So we'll just use the leadership stuff to look at how boards manage difference.  Have you got an example of a really good case - you don't have to; other people have - of how difference has been managed on a board?  You know, diversity has been managed and has led to a good decision?  I mean, you gave me the one earlier where you flagged this is a problem."
27D correcte,27D correcte_239,A,"So that chair was very collaborative.  She used to give people opportunity to run the table and actually canvas each director, and she would, for example, have an annual dinner of the directors and their partners, because she would recognise that directors are actually people and have someone else that's supporting them to come and do these things as well, and so I found that that board had no problem raising any issue and didn't think anything was done enough."
27D correcte,27D correcte_24,A,Yes.
27D correcte,27D correcte_240,Q,Great.  So it had a good culture.
27D correcte,27D correcte_241,A,Absolutely a good culture.  We were very collaborative.
27D correcte,27D correcte_242,Q,So was there anything else you did?  So there was the canvassing.
27D correcte,27D correcte_243,A,"So the thing that she also did was she made us do the AICD, do a self-evaluation tool, and we use their evaluation tool, and a lot of that is around all the directors answering where they think they fit, where they think other directors fit and where they think that she fits, and then I think that self-evaluation tool also helped her, the chair, to address things that she wasn't aware of herself about herself, and she made changes."
27D correcte,27D correcte_244,Q,"Wow, that's commitment."
27D correcte,27D correcte_245,A,"She really did.  And this is where I say - and she's actually got an academe background and she's just a collaborative person.  She can still be a bully and she can still - you know, what do they call them?  The smiling assassin.  She can still be a smiling assassin."
27D correcte,27D correcte_246,Q,So in what way is she a bully?  Can you unpack those - and the smiling assassin - what you mean?
27D correcte,27D correcte_247,A,"So if she thought that something was inappropriate, she would still tell you it was inappropriate in front of everybody else and have a smile on her face.  So that's a smiling assassin."
27D correcte,27D correcte_248,Q,"Right, okay.  Very comfortable with giving negative feedback."
27D correcte,27D correcte_249,A,"With a smile on her face, she could do that.  Whereas I learnt a long time ago, I would not give you negative feedback in front of anybody else.  I would take that out of the room."
27D correcte,27D correcte_25,Q,In terms of gender?
27D correcte,27D correcte_250,Q,Even at the board level?
27D correcte,27D correcte_251,A,Even at the board level.
27D correcte,27D correcte_252,Q,Is it because it's negative feedback personally or negative feedback on an idea?
27D correcte,27D correcte_253,A,"Negative feedback personally.  It's about your personality as opposed to your idea.  If I'm telling you you're talking too much, then indirectly I'm sending the message to everybody else around the table not to talk.  That's why - so it depends on the feedback that you're giving.  You are talking and taking things off course and you are told to, ""Okay, let's bring it back,"" that's different, but if you are talking and she just wants you to stop because she has something more important to say, then that's the wrong message.  Does that make sense?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_254,Q,"Yep, yep, yep.  It means [unclear] 00:56:58."
27D correcte,27D correcte_255,A,[unclear] 00:56:58.  That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_256,Q,I'm not going to listen to everyone.
27D correcte,27D correcte_257,A,"That's right.  And that's the same.  Like, when I was talking about the CEO that was very amicable, then, when it came to the board table, it was, ""Yes, ma'am, three bags full, ma'am,"" and it's like okay, well, no, you're sending the wrong message to the other executive that's around the table that you're a pushover and you shouldn't be.  You need to have some backbone as well as - you still need to be able to guide people and, if they don't trust in your ability to guide, then -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_258,Q,They won't trust your leadership.
27D correcte,27D correcte_259,A,"That's right.  So there are certain leadership skills that you need to have.  Yes, you need to be able to tell people - give them direction, but you also need to respect them as people and direction that you're going to give them at a personal level shouldn't be in front of everybody else."
27D correcte,27D correcte_26,A,"So I'm seeing the level of, I suppose, experience or understanding of what it is to be a director increasing, so what you would call - I mean, so if I can be so blunt as to say what used to be the middle-aged white male domain of meeting in club rooms and giving each other positions is on the decline and it is more about applying to fill a particular skills matrix that's required on the board."
27D correcte,27D correcte_260,Q,"I see what you mean then, the smiling assassin.  What about the smiling assassin, then?  The smiling assassin.  Oh, that was that example.  What was the other one you said?  It's not a smiling assassin."
27D correcte,27D correcte_261,A,To bully someone?
27D correcte,27D correcte_262,Q,To bully something.  What's the bully?
27D correcte,27D correcte_263,A,"So we had one person that would come to the table and become involved in the operation.  So, for example, if they were going to do a project, she was a project manager and so would want to give templates and everything to the staff to do it, and the chair didn't like that and would try and stop her in her tracks, that this is operational, but the way she did it was, ""Doesn't everybody else see that this is wrong?"" so getting everybody else on her side to gang up.  So it can be quiet bullying.  So you don't actually see it until you actually step back.  Does that make sense?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_264,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  So this person was marginalised?  Her view was marginalised because of that strategy."
27D correcte,27D correcte_265,A,Could have been.  Could have been marginalised.  Exactly right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_266,Q,"She felt marginalised, I suppose."
27D correcte,27D correcte_267,A,I don't know if she did.
27D correcte,27D correcte_268,Q,But could've.
27D correcte,27D correcte_269,A,Could have.
27D correcte,27D correcte_27,Q,How long have skill matrixes been around do you think and been so influential?
27D correcte,27D correcte_270,Q,Because of how you all saw that strategy.
27D correcte,27D correcte_271,A,"And this is hindsight.  When you're in the middle of it, you don't actually see it until you step back, because, as I said, it does take a strong person to drive, but that person who's driving needs to be respectful of other people as well.  And as I said, after we did the evaluation, the chair actually took some of that feedback on board."
27D correcte,27D correcte_272,Q,"Thank you so much for spending the time explaining that, because it's subtle and it's contextual and so you've just illustrated how it works on a board.  Because, I mean, there's a lot of literature, but sort of in a way we want to - how does it apply here to the board?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_273,A,So the current chair that I'm working with?
27D correcte,27D correcte_274,Q,Yeah.
27D correcte,27D correcte_275,A,"She's not transparent.  She's not really collaborative.  I'm allegedly deputy chair but we never have a discussion around what the organisation is doing, the conversations that she's having with the CEO.  So if a bus should hit her tomorrow, I would know nothing."
27D correcte,27D correcte_276,Q,So you're feeling a bit vulnerable as a result?
27D correcte,27D correcte_277,A,"Mm.  And that's why, for me, because I can't speak to her, and I've tried to, but I feel like all I'm doing is reporting to her as opposed to her telling me anything, so I'm not really learning much.  So I'm fostering a relationship with the CEO to be able to, I suppose - well, not sidestep her, but still have the information that I would need if I had to step up."
27D correcte,27D correcte_278,Q,And you need that relationship as well.
27D correcte,27D correcte_279,A,Yeah.
27D correcte,27D correcte_28,A,"I did the company director's course in 2010 and, when we spoke about it at the company director's course, they spoke about skills matrix then and having the diversity and having not just a gender diversity but obviously the skills around the table as well, but some of the people that I did the course with - so, for example, one of them was from Seek, one of them was from BMW or Bob Stillwell Australia - and, for example, the Bob Stillwell one was a family group and then they had to advertise out so that they could get that diversity so that they didn't have the family group thing, and that  was 2010.  And I think the guy at Seek said that they didn't have that diversity yet."
27D correcte,27D correcte_280,Q,That's good.
27D correcte,27D correcte_281,A,I hope not all the directors that come in here think they're absolutely fantastic at doing their job.
27D correcte,27D correcte_282,Q,"No, but not all are self-reflective.  I've interviewed 20 - no, hang on - how many of those would be directors?  About 13.  And not all are self-reflective.  One other person's been self-reflective."
27D correcte,27D correcte_283,A,"And this is what I say to my kids is, ""If you don't reflect, you don't know what you're doing wrong or right to do more or less.""  Your growth comes through reflection, whether it's self or anything else."
27D correcte,27D correcte_284,Q,"You're good.  You'll have wonderful children.  They'll be wonderful contributors, I reckon."
27D correcte,27D correcte_285,A,"Well, hopefully.  And I did say to them - somebody said to me - because my husband's a GP and his staff said to me, ""Oh my God, your children are so polite.  We know so many other medical doctors, their children are just really arrogant,"" and I said, ""Well you know what?  Up until they're 18, that's because of me.  After 18, it's because of them."""
27D correcte,27D correcte_286,Q,"Oh, that's so lovely.  That's so beautifully put.  And that goes back to how your see leadership."
27D correcte,27D correcte_287,A,"Mm, absolutely.  And I keep telling my kids that mothers have a big responsibility to drive the change that they want to see.  I mean, I'm not the first one that came up with that.  Eleanor Roosevelt first said it.  But it really is we have a responsibility to do that, but not everybody - and this is where I think people have to recognise that not everybody has those skills and then, like that girl that was working under me, not everybody wants to take on the skills.  Some of them are happy with that status quo."
27D correcte,27D correcte_288,Q,"So, we've got a few more questions.  When identifying potential new members, does your board consider ways to increase diversity?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_289,A,"Yes, yes.  So, as I said, the current matrix, the skills matrix, and what we are doing - because we feel culture is important, we don't want someone that's going to - not give us a lot of pushback but have different things on their agenda, and what we're doing is we're having independent directors on the subcommittees and they work with us there for a year and then we can ask them to apply for a board position if it fits."
27D correcte,27D correcte_29,Q,"So do you think, though, that the skill matrix has shifted the focus to skill diversity, whereas in the past diversity was understood as gender?  You mentioned the matrix being important."
27D correcte,27D correcte_290,Q,So culture - it's not that - you don't want too much pushback.  You don't want -
27D correcte,27D correcte_291,A,"So when I say too much pushback - so, for example, if somebody was just going to come and say - well, again, not have the same leadership skills around the table.  If someone is going to be just another bully who's going to come on the - we don't need more bullies really."
27D correcte,27D correcte_292,Q,Beautiful.  So I'll go back to what you said about bullying.  Do people outside the board influence your selection process?  Yes in this case.
27D correcte,27D correcte_293,A,"They do because of the demographics that we're dealing with, absolutely, and, of course, the executive also."
27D correcte,27D correcte_294,Q,"Yeah.  So you've got the exec.  But you've also got the rules, so the standards."
27D correcte,27D correcte_295,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_296,Q,And they're state?
27D correcte,27D correcte_297,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_298,Q,And does the Health Department have a say?
27D correcte,27D correcte_299,A,"They definitely have a say insofar as the CEO and they communicate regularly with the chair and the CEO, but, as far as choosing more board members, not really.  Because we're a community health service as opposed to a hospital."
27D correcte,27D correcte_3,Q,"That's great.  And the organisation is not-for-profit, this one?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_30,A,"Yeah, yeah.  So when we were recruiting, we had an idea, for example, that we wanted somebody with a legal background, or we wanted somebody with a health care background.  So we didn't necessarily say male or female.  Having said that, when we interviewed, I remember they brought us - shortlisted about 10 candidates, none of which were female.  So I said, ""Listen, I'd like to have a look; how many applications did you get?""  They said, ""We got more than 60 or 70.""  I said, ""That's fine.  I just want to have a quick look,"" and I went through and I picked out two female candidates that I thought we could bring on, and, in the end, the two that had applied were actually - one was so far geographically that it was going to be unmanageable and the other one had - not that children should be an issue but her CV read that she had three young children, a full-time job and was doing an MBA and already had one other board position, and I thought about it that I didn't think that she could manage the extra, because we were in a stage of going through the merger where we felt that you had to be not necessarily operational but probably be a bit more involved and have a few more meetings and stay on top of things more than when things are just going smoothly, so I felt that she probably couldn't make the time commitment."
27D correcte,27D correcte_300,Q,"Public hospital, because that's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_301,A,"In public hospitals, they do absolutely."
27D correcte,27D correcte_302,Q,But they do for a CEO?  Why?
27D correcte,27D correcte_303,A,"Well no, they don't necessarily.  They encourage us to have one and they encourage us to have this is what we think you should be looking for."
27D correcte,27D correcte_304,Q,"Oh, okay.  They just sort of help you."
27D correcte,27D correcte_305,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_306,Q,But unlike the public hospitals.  The public hospitals are much more -
27D correcte,27D correcte_307,A,Absolutely.  Restrictive.
27D correcte,27D correcte_308,Q,"Yeah, exactly.  That was the word.  Do you feel tensions can arise in board selection -  oh yeah.  Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process between on the one hand trying to obtain a collegiate fit - that's the culture thing - and on the other trying to avoid group think?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_309,A,"I think there's a natural tension in that anyway.  It's like the flip side of the coin.  Because we haven't gotten to the stage at our table that we're doing that, I really couldn't tell you."
27D correcte,27D correcte_31,Q,"So that's why, then -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_310,Q,"You've talked about, anyway, the balancing of different points of view and then the bullies, so really it's -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_311,A,"And that could be important to me as one of the directors around that table but it may not be important to somebody else at that table, and I could be thinking I'm value adding to the board but other people might think, ""Oh my God, she's wishy washy.  She doesn't add anything.""  Maybe they just want to see dollar value."
27D correcte,27D correcte_312,Q,Qualitative research is open to that natural bias.
27D correcte,27D correcte_313,A,Absolutely.
27D correcte,27D correcte_314,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  So it's okay.  It's good.  Do the boards that you're familiar with have any barriers to managing or building its diversity?  The Aboriginal, you said."
27D correcte,27D correcte_315,A,"Yeah, absolutely, and I think that that stands for - if I want to talk about diversity, it's not just Aboriginal.  Anything that you would put under diverse is going to have some kind of barrier just as a natural thing.  So, for example, when we're talking about women diversity, just because they are the ones that are going to carry the babies and feed them for the first little while, there is a natural - not bias; the opposite of bias - prejudice against them."
27D correcte,27D correcte_316,Q,"It's a stereotype, isn't it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_317,A,Absolutely.  Absolutely.
27D correcte,27D correcte_318,Q,"Okay.  So what I've got here are two types of barriers.  One's a supply barrier and the other is a stereotype prejudice.  You know, it's about expectations."
27D correcte,27D correcte_319,A,"Mm.  It is about expectations, because I mean, even if you look at - so, for example, both my daughters that are studying medicine are looking at what speciality are they going to have to do, and my husband is saying to them, ""You girls are going to have kids and you're going to be at home with the babies,"" and I'm like, ""Stop.  Don't make decisions for them.  Let them make their own decisions in the future,"" and they should be allowed to have that decision, even though I think -."
27D correcte,27D correcte_32,A,So then we had to go back to just the guys.
27D correcte,27D correcte_320,A,"The other thing is you can't have a part-time CEO.  You need someone that's going to be there full-time and more than full-time to be a CEO.  How many women want to do that?  How many men want to do that?  So it's not just when we talk about the gender diversity.  It's the candidates that want to do it or not do it and how much of it is social norm, so how many guys are actually pushed that they have to be driven and how many women are pushed that they shouldn't be driven."
27D correcte,27D correcte_321,Q,"And that girl, the young woman who was so good but she didn't want to go any further."
27D correcte,27D correcte_322,A,That's right.  She could have been a CEO.  She just had the social capacity for it.  What do they call it?  The EQ.  The EQ for it.
27D correcte,27D correcte_323,Q,"Yeah, EQ for it."
27D correcte,27D correcte_324,A,"That's right.  So I think EQ is more important than IQ when it comes to having those positions, especially because you can outsource and buy in the IQ that you need."
27D correcte,27D correcte_325,Q,That's right.  That analysis you can get done as the projects reports.
27D correcte,27D correcte_326,A,Absolutely.
27D correcte,27D correcte_327,Q,"As long as you can read the report, yeah.  From a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted; for example, through gender targets and quotas and the skill mix?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_328,A,"I'm happy because it makes it front of mind, but if I go fishing and say, ""I want a barramundi,"" but I'm just in a whole sea of salmon, am I still going to be able to achieve it anyway?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_329,Q,"Yeah, it's not the full answer.  So your pipeline - have to supply."
27D correcte,27D correcte_33,Q,But you checked it to see whether it was an equitable thing?
27D correcte,27D correcte_330,A,"[unclear] 01:08:57, you know.  Like how many girls at school are thinking about becoming board directors in the future, or even think about it, for example.  We did a CFO symposium a couple of days ago and one of the ladies that came, she's a director on three ASX - one ASX 50, one ASX 100, one ASX 500, and she's a director, and she said, ""Oh, I was a director on not-for-profit boards,"" and then the more and more and more and more she spoke, it occurred to me that she had been treasurer of a not-for-profit from when she was about 30, but now she has these - so previously things were done differently.  They didn't call them boards.  Like, you know, if you were the treasurer of your school committee, you were technically on the board, but not really on the board.  So she had the foresight then to think this way.  How many others do?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_331,Q,"No, I know, it was rare.  It was rare.  Wasn't role modelled, and it wasn't recognised, because women's life's, like, you know the school [unclear] 01:10:10."
27D correcte,27D correcte_332,A,What about the Country Women's Association?  Making cakes.
27D correcte,27D correcte_333,Q,"Exactly.  Finally, looking 10 years - this is the last one - into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_334,A,"Look, utopia would be fantastic, obviously.  I don't know if it's necessarily achievable and I don't know - this is something that I think about now at the age that I'm at.  If I can step away from my job for over a week and no one notices, how effective am I, and is that job even important?  How much paper shuffling do we actually do?  So we were in China and I saw how fast they build roads and how - and people say, ""Okay, but they haven't got things in place to deal with crises.""  Yet they still manage.  They are so much more organised than we are.  You go on a train and they've got the arrows that people that are going in go this way, people that are going out - so you have to have the rules in place for these things to happen and people just follow them.  How many people here in Australia are like, ""Oh, I just want to duck in that coffee.  I know it's no standing but no one will notice if I just do it.  It's only me.""  Flexible."
27D correcte,27D correcte_335,Q,So do you think we're lacking the rules to cultivate diverse boards into the future?  Is it about that?
27D correcte,27D correcte_336,A,"I think if more people were educated around it, for sure, and, if there was more regulation around it, probably yes, but then, when you regulate, you're going to end up with group think again."
27D correcte,27D correcte_337,Q,"Yeah, group think because you've said, ""Right, you've got to have this many of this and this and this.""  How would it be group think, because you've got all these different voices?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_338,A,"I'll tell you how it would be group think.  They tell you.  They tell you.  People that do more study start to understand that what they know is actually very small to the amount of knowledge that there is out there and so are less risk takers, so you find that the majority of innovation that happens are by people that are less educated.  They have a certain amount of education because they have to recognise the risks and everything, but the innovators are the ones that are less educated.  So the more you teach people, the more they will think alike and be less risk taking."
27D correcte,27D correcte_339,Q,"Wow, that's an amazing claim."
27D correcte,27D correcte_34,A,Exactly.
27D correcte,27D correcte_340,A,Just if you take it to the real extreme.
27D correcte,27D correcte_341,Q,"Because I'm thinking of the start-ups that I interviewed; they were such a different feel to any of the others.  Like, it's real different.  And it's seriously innovative.  They were MBAs and they were well educated, but they were -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_342,A,"But was the MBA around running their business as opposed to actually - like, the people that come up with the ideas?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_343,Q,"No, they came up with the idea and the way they run the business.  They're into conflict.  Talked about conflict.  Has to have conflict.  But what they mean by conflict is not what you mean.  It's not bullying.  So different points of view, then, is what they were talking about.  Have to have that otherwise decisions won't be good, and everyone has to be able to put their penny's worth in.  Like, you don't want cowards around the table."
27D correcte,27D correcte_344,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_345,Q,"And you want people who think outside the square.  That's what's rewarded, and that goes right from the board down through the team, and the way the whole place was structured, they had team-based work.  It was all everyone [descriptive sound – ch-ch-ch] like that.  It was amazing."
27D correcte,27D correcte_346,A,"Oh well, I'll take that claim back then."
27D correcte,27D correcte_347,Q,"But no, no, no.  But that's only - start-ups are so different.  It's like you've got start-ups and you've got others it would seem."
27D correcte,27D correcte_348,A,"So is that really - because then, if I think back to - what do you call it - entrepreneurs in general that see opportunities, then they're not necessarily not educated."
27D correcte,27D correcte_349,Q,That's right.  I don't think so.
27D correcte,27D correcte_35,Q,And you found it was really?
27D correcte,27D correcte_350,A,They're not necessarily not educated.
27D correcte,27D correcte_351,Q,No.  No.  Like your husband.
27D correcte,27D correcte_352,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_353,Q,He's educated.
27D correcte,27D correcte_354,A,"Yeah, that's right."
27D correcte,27D correcte_355,Q,In quite a disciplined field.
27D correcte,27D correcte_356,A,"Yeah, that's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  But I reckon he -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_357,Q,He sees opportunities.
27D correcte,27D correcte_358,A,"Yeah, he just sees opportunities."
27D correcte,27D correcte_359,Q,It's a different way of thinking.
27D correcte,27D correcte_36,A,"Yeah, yeah."
27D correcte,27D correcte_360,A,"And he does take risks.  I mean, we've lost a lot of money along the way when he's -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_361,Q,And you made some.
27D correcte,27D correcte_362,A,That's exactly right.  And we made some.  And I remember the first [unclear] 01:15:07.  We actually owned a function centre for about three years.
27D correcte,27D correcte_363,Q,Do you want me to turn this off now?
27D correcte,27D correcte_364,A,Yes.
27D correcte,27D correcte_37,Q,"Oh, good.  So we'll go back in a minute to that later.  So how important do you think it is to have a diverse board.  If, let's say, 10 is extremely important and 1 is not important at all, what do you think?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_38,A,"No, I'd say it's extremely important."
27D correcte,27D correcte_39,Q,So 10?
27D correcte,27D correcte_4,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_40,A,"Yeah, absolutely.  All the studies show you that having a diverse board, number 1) creates a better culture in the organisation.  Also, when you have a diversity of thinking, you can also have a diversity of approaches because the people that are working in the organisations are not the same as the people around the table.  If people in the organisation are not represented at the board, then you're not going to be filling the organisation's needs."
27D correcte,27D correcte_41,Q,And is that the purpose of the board: to fill the organisation's needs?
27D correcte,27D correcte_42,A,"No, no, no.  The purpose of the board is really to drive the direction of the organisation but, if you don't have an understanding of the people that are working for that organisation, then you could be asking for stars and they only have moons."
27D correcte,27D correcte_43,Q,"That's great.  So what do you feel has led to the change in terms of increased diversity?  Or, sorry, the sense of it being important.  What's led to that change of it being important now, say compared to 20 years ago?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_44,A,Can we say the stuff-ups that they did 20 years ago -
27D correcte,27D correcte_45,Q,"Yeah, of course you can."
27D correcte,27D correcte_46,A,-@ and no one actually being courageous enough to speak up because they did all think the same and it was okay?
27D correcte,27D correcte_47,Q,"Right.  Yeah, lack of open disclosure.  Lack of transparency."
27D correcte,27D correcte_48,A,Mm.  Even though that can still happen with a diverse board.
27D correcte,27D correcte_49,Q,So do you think those stuff-ups were because decisions were made from a particular - a rigid framework - background - perspective?
27D correcte,27D correcte_5,Q,And so it was two not-for-profits merged?
27D correcte,27D correcte_50,A,"Yes, and also self - what do you call it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_51,Q,Interest?
27D correcte,27D correcte_52,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_53,Q,"Oh, right?  Really?  Okay."
27D correcte,27D correcte_54,A,Look at the Commonwealth Bank and look at the NAB.  Is that [unclear] 00:09:45?
27D correcte,27D correcte_55,Q,"Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  Bring it all in."
27D correcte,27D correcte_56,A,It's certainly not just for the organisation.
27D correcte,27D correcte_57,Q,"Yeah, yeah.  It's for the pocket of the -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_58,A,I actually worked there back in the day.
27D correcte,27D correcte_59,Q,"Oh really?  So how would diversity influence or contain self-interest at the board level, or how does lack of diversity sustain a self-interested focus?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_6,A,That's right.
27D correcte,27D correcte_60,A,"So lack of diversity; obviously, if you're self-interested – and I think the same as you, I'm going to have self-interest as well.  So we may actually have competing interests but, in general, you can collude more anyway, because you both have that kind of personality where it is not necessarily about the organisation but about yourself.  Diversity of thought will at least help to break that down and, even if people around the table may not be strong enough to speak about it at the table, if they feel that there's somebody else that agrees with them only slightly, they can take the conversation out and look at different ways to deal with things anyway."
27D correcte,27D correcte_61,Q,"Can you give an example, from your experience, of how that might have been done?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_62,A,"In the previous organisation before we merged, there were some kind of indicators that things at the organisation were not going well, and one of the indicators that screamed at me was we had 10 resignations in November and then 11 resignations in December, and I brought it up and I said, ""Look, I don't think that this is normal,"" and they said, ""Oh no, it's just because we're going through change.""  So I actually took it offline and spoke to the chair and I said, ""Look, people don't normally leave their jobs around Christmas.""  No matter how bad it would be, they always look at leaving after Christmas."
27D correcte,27D correcte_63,A,"And then we only had about just over 200 staff, so that was a high percentage, like if you talk relative to the number of your FTEs, and she said, ""Yeah, okay, we'll have a look at it,"" and that's when we got a letter from the local councillor and from the department about claims of bullying from the CEO.  So for me there was an indicator and I brought it up and no one else - so I took it offline and then, just by chance, we got those complaints as well, and then we had to do an investigation, stand her down, and all of that, and then eventually she was asked to leave."
27D correcte,27D correcte_64,Q,So do you think the board - most people around the board were actually protecting the CEO?
27D correcte,27D correcte_65,A,"Not necessarily protecting the CEO but didn't think of that as an - and this is where diversity is really important.  I'd run my own business - I'd had a day hospital - and so I was conscious of, I suppose, staff think and the cycles of staff think around the financial years and all that kind of thing, so to me I would use that as an indicator in my own business, whereas the other people around the table were - one was from academe, one was from a strictly auditing thing, so they weren't in -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_66,Q,Just didn't get it.
27D correcte,27D correcte_67,A,"Academe wasn't even something that they would even look at, whereas for me it was.  So having that diversity led us to look at that, but they didn't think that it was really a - and I think a lot of people still don't think it's an indicator, but for me, from someone who's come from the background of running a business, it is an indicator that tells you your staff are unhappy."
27D correcte,27D correcte_68,Q,"So, what I'm hearing also though is - and this is later questions but let's go now because the story's leading there - you voiced it at the table and you were a lonely voice at the table?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_69,A,I was new.
27D correcte,27D correcte_7,Q,"And this is health, isn't it?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_70,Q,You were new?
27D correcte,27D correcte_71,A,Mm.  So I'd actually made it onto the board in October and then saw this in November and December.
27D correcte,27D correcte_72,Q,That's a tough call.
27D correcte,27D correcte_73,A,Yeah.
27D correcte,27D correcte_74,Q,"But still, you were on the board and you weren't heard?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_75,A,Mm.
27D correcte,27D correcte_76,Q,"So you had to go offline and speak to the chair, and then the chair - did the chair hear what you were saying or it was only -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_77,A,"Well, no, she did hear it but I would never know, because hindsight is a wonderful thing, if she would have acted on it.  It just happened at the same time as the complaint."
27D correcte,27D correcte_78,Q,So the letter then really - but at least the complaint then - you had indicated -
27D correcte,27D correcte_79,A,Acknowledged what I'd -
27D correcte,27D correcte_8,A,"That's right.  That's right.  Community health even, which is very Victoria-specific."
27D correcte,27D correcte_80,Q,"- this is the context and this, you know, was a sign."
27D correcte,27D correcte_81,A,"And then, as a result of that, we actually established a new grievance procedure where people could actually contact the chair, because the organisation didn't have that process in place so, if there were going to be any complaints, the CEO was the complaints officer.  So then we revisited that whole grievance procedure so that it could be made to somebody other than the CEO as well."
27D correcte,27D correcte_82,Q,So you identified an issue that would not have been identified.  That complaint might have arrived out of the blue and it mightn't have been acknowledged.
27D correcte,27D correcte_83,A,"Well, as a result of me noticing that, I actually went back and did a search on the CEO and where she'd been beforehand and then also found out that the CFO had come along with her and then a third person.  So she had brought people with her and they were actually, I suppose, bullying the staff together.  But it was only through doing that search that we found out that they were actually working together - oh well, bullying together, as opposed to just the CEO."
27D correcte,27D correcte_84,Q,"Interesting, isn't it?  So that sort of suggesting that you want to have diversity in terms of social networks at the exec level as well?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_85,A,"Mm.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  The current board that we're on now, we've had another director resign, and we've had a look around the table and no one around the table actually lives or works in the population that we're actually serving.  So when we're looking for a new director, that's going to be one of the, I suppose, skills that we want to [fit in] 00:16:55."
27D correcte,27D correcte_86,Q,Do you think that there's any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating?
27D correcte,27D correcte_87,A,Around diversity?
27D correcte,27D correcte_88,Q,Around diversity.  That it's not important in some situations?
27D correcte,27D correcte_89,A,"No.  No.  I think it's important in all situations because I'm even looking at, for example, if you think about mental health and they talk about having lived experience and they talk about having carers, and if they were the only people that were around the table, then that's not going to be enough.  It's not going to drive enough change to improve outcomes."
27D correcte,27D correcte_9,Q,"I have a health background, so Gippsland Health, so yeah."
27D correcte,27D correcte_90,Q,And you went through a merger.  That's a complex procedure.
27D correcte,27D correcte_91,A,Absolutely.
27D correcte,27D correcte_92,Q,"So did diversity help with that, do you think?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_93,A,"Diversity certainly helped.  Diversity certainly helped, and, totally off the record, I don't think there was total transparency when that merger happened."
27D correcte,27D correcte_94,Q,"The institutions around health are - you're not the only - so this won't be able to be identified.  So the institutions around health, public health, they're funded by the government, so there's quite a political -"
27D correcte,27D correcte_95,A,"It's sad to say but, from that aspect, it's still who you know and not what you know, and they talk about looking for diversity but I don't know if they are actually looking for that diversity, because you get to the point where, if somebody is too different and can't understand what you're trying to drive, then you think there's going to be a mismatch of culture, and I think that drives a lot of decisions.  So, for example, working with - and I do want to de-identify it because I don't want [unclear] 00:18:57."
27D correcte,27D correcte_96,Q,"Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'll personally - I can send you the transcript.  Once the transcript is done, let's send you the transcript before it's send.  You can deidentify it because, if you - and then I'll take that, because I'm very aware in health it's a small field."
27D correcte,27D correcte_97,A,And everybody knows everybody.
27D correcte,27D correcte_98,Q,"Exactly.  And so I mightn't see that this connects to you or your organisation because it's not a name, so would you do that?"
27D correcte,27D correcte_99,A,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
28D Chair,28D Chair_1,Q,"Good, okay. Thanks, Participant 28D for agreeing to participate in our research on board diversity. Firstly, I’d just like to check your discipline background. So what are you, accountant? What’s your discipline background?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_10,Q,"Yeah, I know it all takes time. Great, okay."
28D Chair,28D Chair_100,A,"So I think there are definitely two schools of thought, and that certainly came out in the research that I did around it as well, that there are two schools of thought, there is – not all men think the same about this issue. Thankfully more and more men appear to be of the view that we need to get serious about this, and we’re not doing it for tokenism, we’re doing it because we genuinely want a diverse board."
28D Chair,28D Chair_101,Q,"Do you think younger men are more likely to hold the view that there should be more women, or it doesn’t matter? Age is not a factor?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_102,A,"I think it can be. Having said that, some younger men are highly competitive and they – I don’t know that they would be prepared to have a woman on the board ahead of themselves if they – so I guess it can be a factor. Definitely some of the men that are very old-school that I’ve come across are older, they are 60 plus, sort of in that age group. So I have experienced both."
28D Chair,28D Chair_103,Q,"So the board that you are the only female on at the moment, how does – do you feel it’s conservative? Like, how old are the men roughly?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_104,A,"They’re all over 50, all of them are over 50."
28D Chair,28D Chair_105,Q,They’re all over 50. And how’s the decision making? Do you feel that it’s conservative? Is there creative problem solving? Is there a bit of groupthink?
28D Chair,28D Chair_106,A,"I have to say that it’s not conservative in its decision making. It’s conservative potentially in views of – in some views, but not – it’s not a board who’s not willing to change what they’re doing in terms of their decision making."
28D Chair,28D Chair_107,Q,So groupthink is not an issue?
28D Chair,28D Chair_108,A,"No, I don’t think so."
28D Chair,28D Chair_109,Q,"Yep, yep, because this is where it’s the thinking, it’s ultimately about the thinking, so I’m just wondering whether it’s the respect side or it’s the thinking in your – what you talked about earlier, that the thinking and then with respect, [you like] 00:26:53 the team, based on respect, leads to good decision making. So I was just wondering whether it was the diversity of thinking feeding in through a filter of respect, mutual respect?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_11,A,"Yeah, exactly."
28D Chair,28D Chair_110,A,Yeah.
28D Chair,28D Chair_111,Q,"So that feeling you’re getting, is that the mutual respect level?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_112,A,"The feeling of what, sorry?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_113,Q,"Oh, on that board you described a feeling of definitely being the only one -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_114,A,Yeah.
28D Chair,28D Chair_115,Q,- so is -
28D Chair,28D Chair_116,A,"I do feel it now that I am the only one, definitely. I think, like I say, they are very respectful to my face. If – I just wonder as I said I think if they had their choice they would definitely have another of their colleagues or friends on the boards. Because I am a different one, I am younger and I’m female, and they are very respectful to me and I felt maybe they just wouldn’t be disrespectful to my face. Maybe that’s what it is. But I do think -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_117,Q,So there’s a lack of trust there?
28D Chair,28D Chair_118,A,What’s that?
28D Chair,28D Chair_119,Q,From your point of view there’s – your trust is qualified?
28D Chair,28D Chair_12,Q,"Great. Look, by all means draw on your findings and we’ll – if you could shoot me any publications that are – so that we can search for them later -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_120,A,"Yeah, I think – well, I think so. I think when I say what’s critical is bringing diversity of thinking to the board that I think the majority of that board is not diverse. They do however feel comfortable in challenging each other, which is healthy, and I think my views are probably the outlier at times. Sometimes however I’m able to change the course of a decision. So I feel that they do respect it when they feel the respect is warranted, when they think I have a good idea they’ll [will use] 00:28:55 it, which is good."
28D Chair,28D Chair_121,Q,"Great, now -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_122,A,"But there’s not a lot different minds coming from different backgrounds, they’re all coming from similar backgrounds, except for me potentially."
28D Chair,28D Chair_123,Q,"Right. So can you give me an example of how your input led to a different decision? So your diverse input led – so that process, so we can understand how that voice – because this model you gave me is really interesting and I’d like to have it fleshed out a bit."
28D Chair,28D Chair_124,A,"So what can happen is the executive will bring in an idea, we have a very capable executive team and they’ll bring an idea, and they’ve thought it out and they’ve considered it and they’ll bring an idea. And the view that I can often bring is one of a younger person’s mindset, so I’ll say well – I’ll bring a perspective of social media use, or I’ll bring a perspective of yes, that would work traditionally in the industry but I don’t think, if we’re trying to attract a new demographic or a younger clientele, that have we considered this, or have we considered that? So I tend to – if I [eject] 00:30:17 that because they’re looking for that then often they can say that’s [unclear] 00:30:23 and it’s really good and maybe we won’t do that yet, or maybe – so where I have – where my thinking differs because of my different background, they will listen. And they do take it on board and sometimes it doesn’t mean that things are overturned, but it will mean that they will modify the decision to take that into account."
28D Chair,28D Chair_125,Q,"Okay, so you’ve had evidence of that, that’s -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_126,A,Yeah.
28D Chair,28D Chair_127,Q,"Okay, good. So if you then would rate – let’s say I give you a scale where 10, diversity is extremely important and one, it’s not important at all, where would you put it?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_128,A,"I think it’s a nine, or a 10. It’s right up there, it’s really important."
28D Chair,28D Chair_129,Q,And so why is it so important?
28D Chair,28D Chair_13,A,"Yeah, no problem."
28D Chair,28D Chair_130,A,"Because you can get the decisions wrong. If everybody is the same age, comes from the same background, the same demography, or same demographic background, the same pathway to the board in terms of their executive career then the decisions you’re going to make are going to be shaped by that one frame of thinking. That’s dangerous for an organisation."
28D Chair,28D Chair_131,A,"What you want is people questioning, people saying ‘I don’t think that will work, I’m concerned about this. Have we thought of that?’ And you just don’t get that if everybody comes from the same background and pathway."
28D Chair,28D Chair_132,A,"Equally, the other aspect is if people don’t feel respected enough to speak up you’re going to have a problem. Because they might come from a very diverse background but if they’re not comfortable opening their mouth they may as well not be there."
28D Chair,28D Chair_133,Q,"Oh, brilliant."
28D Chair,28D Chair_134,A,"So you have to create a culture where people are very comfortable to challenge, and the challenge is invited, and that an effective chair will scan the room and say ‘I haven’t heard from you yet, could you tell me your views on this?’ And if they don’t do that, and if you have a culture where for example tenure is a marker of importance and value, so therefore the newcomers don’t feel comfortable speaking up against the deputy chairs or the chairs and longstanding directors that have been there forever, again you are undermining the value of the diversity that you’ve placed on that board."
28D Chair,28D Chair_135,A,"So it is diversity of thinking and background, but equally it’s the culture at the board table and does everybody feel equally valued? Does everybody genuinely feel like their vote is important and as valuable as anybody else’s vote, despite how long they’ve been there? And if you can really foster that, particularly as chair [but] 00:33:13 those other directors then you can maximise what you can draw from that diversity around the table."
28D Chair,28D Chair_136,Q,"That’s fantastic, thank you. That links in to other interviews but puts it together so clearly, so well. Thank you so much."
28D Chair,28D Chair_137,A,"Oh good, a pleasure."
28D Chair,28D Chair_138,Q,"That inclusive culture was a feature in one interview, and so what you’ve said just pulls that in beautifully so thank you, that’s brilliant."
28D Chair,28D Chair_139,A,[unclear] 00:33:41
28D Chair,28D Chair_14,Q,"- should they be published, that’d be great."
28D Chair,28D Chair_140,Q,"Do you think that there is any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating? For example, if it’s high uncertainty or risk?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_141,A,Importance rating of diversity?
28D Chair,28D Chair_142,Q,"Yeah, yep."
28D Chair,28D Chair_143,A,"Yep, if it’s just tokenistic. So if we’re going to put someone on the board because they’re indigenous, but just because they’re indigenous, then that’s insulting to indigenous people and it’s not going to be effective at the board table."
28D Chair,28D Chair_144,A,"And the same applies to – sometimes you see government boards say they want age diversity and so they’re looking for particularly young people. Well, if you’re going to put a 25 year old on a board who has very limited work experience and no board experience, and not support and train them and develop them, then that’s insulting to young people. So diversity for the sake of diversity is incorrect and tokenistic."
28D Chair,28D Chair_145,A,"But if you are genuinely wanting to get a diverse board ,and that involves – what you need to do is find people with the ability to do that role, or the capability and then support them and train them and develop them so they understand their obligations and their duties, and they know what they’re there to do. That’s fine. But don’t just get somebody because they’re a different colour, because that is not true diversity in what I described before where diversity of thinking is what you want. If you’ve got somebody on that board who is feeling so out of place that they’re too afraid to open their mouth, what’s the point?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_146,Q,"Exactly. So are you concerned that this could be an outcome of targets, gender targets and quotas?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_147,A,"It could be, it could be, so I’m not in favour of quotas as numbers. What I’m in favour of is targets, and if that’s not working and we have to consider quotas, fine, but the onus should be on the board to prove that this isn’t tokenistic, these are people that we have searched long and hard for and found because their skills will be extremely useful at this table. And we are developing these people, if need be, to get them up to speed with their obligations."
28D Chair,28D Chair_148,Q,"Look, you are the first person to really make such a strong point about tokenism, so -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_149,A,Oh.
28D Chair,28D Chair_15,A,So you’re after the academic journal stuff aren’t you? You don’t want the -
28D Chair,28D Chair_150,Q,"No, no, other people have alluded to it but you’ve got a really good way of describing it. So in the future questions if you have something – please drill down on tokenism at any point you think it’s relevant because it’s clearly important and you’re really showing how and why. So I’m just putting that out there and inviting you because -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_151,A,"Well look, I’ll give you a recent example."
28D Chair,28D Chair_152,Q,"Yeah, good."
28D Chair,28D Chair_153,A,"So we have - as I said I work with some indigenous directors, and one particular indigenous director it’s their first board. And they are incredibly capable and they are high level in their executive career, and they are very considered, but they’re learning their stripes. Because being a director, a non-executive director is a very different skill to being an executive in the company. And so we really want to keep this person, we really want to develop them, so we want them to feel like they are free to speak up on anything, and we want to encourage that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_154,A,"So I recently made the suggestion that we put this person through the Company Directors course. Now that’s over and above what we would normally spend annually for directors, but I said ‘This person is fantastic, we want them to stay, we want them to develop into this role and we want them to stay on our board. So we need to go - we need to get them qualified, and we need to do it.’"
28D Chair,28D Chair_155,A,"So why wouldn’t we do that? This is about closing the gap, it’s about giving that person a leg up, but it’s about saying we’re backing you. You’re great, we want you to be here, we want you to be fully up to speed. So that’s very much about not being tokenistic. It’s about saying we’re glad you’re here, we want you to feel free to speak up and we want you to be really comfortable [unclear] 00:38:17 because we think you’re fantastic. So we agreed we would absolutely fund them to do - and the reality is the rest of the board members don’t use their full expenditure of professional development each year anyway so we can divert all of the budget to them for a year, and that would be a great thing for all of us to do that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_156,Q,"Brilliant, brilliant. I was wondering whether – because people from low socio-economic backgrounds, financial barriers can be quite real and so this presents a way that a board can create opportunity for people from -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_157,A,"Absolutely. And sometimes executives, the people – I mean, it’s not a cheap exercise to do the Company Directors course but it is a qualification that’s sought after in this space and some people are [perfect] 00:39:14 in their executive career but their executive employer might not be prepared to pay that much money because it’s not directly impacting what they’re doing now. So does that mean that we don’t want them on our board if they’re fantastic? No, it means we should get them on."
28D Chair,28D Chair_158,A,"And this person actually – I have kind of taken it upon myself a little bit to just contact them outside board meetings and make sure they’re going okay, and encourage them and remind them how valued their opinion is and that they should feel free to speak up at any time. And we’ve kind of formed a bit of a mentoring relationship. But I kind of seem that as giving back, and I look forward to seeing their career unfold. I mean, they are talented and capable and in 10 years’ time this person will be on multiple boards if they choose to be, so – and being a really effective non-executive director with an indigenous background, which is a highly sought-after aspect of diversity. And hopefully they can pave the way for future indigenous directors to see that they’ve done exceedingly well and that this is not out of reach."
28D Chair,28D Chair_159,A,"So I kind of think that’s part of my duty and role. I’ve been fortunate and I feel very blessed in what I’ve been able to do on boards so far to date, but my role doesn’t stop with me being satisfied with what I’ve got out of it."
28D Chair,28D Chair_16,Q,"Oh, look -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_160,Q,Your performance.
28D Chair,28D Chair_161,A,I have to give back.
28D Chair,28D Chair_162,Q,"Yeah, that’s brilliant, that’s really good. Okay, good. Does this kind of diversity – is there a particular kind of diversity that matters more than others?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_163,A,"Look, when people talk about diversity, and this came through in my research, that when people talk about diversity they predominantly are talking about gender, and that to me - it’s the most visible form of diversity, and it is definitely the right place to start. Because I have four children, two boys, two girls, it has always gotten up my nose that from the time of their birth the girls were, on average, less likely to achieve in executive roles and board roles than the boys. That is simply not okay with me."
28D Chair,28D Chair_164,A,"So that, because half of the world is women, is the right place to start. One of the things though that companies are talking about increasingly is that’s the first place to start, but what’s next? We can’t just think about it in terms of gender because we don’t want all white boards that are 50% women and 50% men. We have to think about other aspects of diversity. So what about disability, what about indigenous people? What about other nationalities? What about age? What about geographic? There are so many other aspects of diversity that need to be considered. So it is the right place to start but it is by no means the end, gender."
28D Chair,28D Chair_165,Q,"Some people have said that they think gender is like a sign, a sign of commitment to diversity. So they see it as if there’s no gender diversity then the other kinds of diversity won’t be there either, but if there is it’s likely that other kinds of diversity – do you think that’s a reliable indicator?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_166,A,"I do think so, and I think that sign comes from that’s where the pressure’s coming from the major - the powerbrokers and the people that are exerting pressure on companies to become more diverse, all of those things – the targets around 30% plus, are all on gender diversity. No one to my knowledge has come out and said you’ve got to have a diversity target on indigenous people. So I think it is a sign because it’s the one thing is being measured and looked at, but I do also think that if people are inclusive of women they’re going to naturally, hopefully, be more inclusive of other types of diversity as well."
28D Chair,28D Chair_167,Q,"Yes, because you see – I mean, in a way this goes back to your idea of the culture of the board, the inclusive culture."
28D Chair,28D Chair_168,A,It does.
28D Chair,28D Chair_169,Q,"I mean if it’s got an inclusive culture it will have more women, and if it’s got an inclusive culture it will use other kinds of diversity, it won’t be token and -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_17,A,- other publications [inaudible] 00:02:32
28D Chair,28D Chair_170,A,That’s right.
28D Chair,28D Chair_171,Q,"- it will attract – yeah, Okay, good."
28D Chair,28D Chair_172,A,I think an all-white male board that doesn’t want women is not going to want indigenous directors either.
28D Chair,28D Chair_173,Q,Exactly.
28D Chair,28D Chair_174,A,"So yeah, it is about an inclusive culture, absolutely."
28D Chair,28D Chair_175,Q,"Yes, so it’s probably a sign of the culture."
28D Chair,28D Chair_176,A,Yeah.
28D Chair,28D Chair_177,Q,"Okay, good. Now we’ve got some questions on board functioning. Are there particular board functions that diversity really helps with, and if so can you give me an example? Ooh."
28D Chair,28D Chair_178,A,"Hi, sorry, I don’t know what happened there."
28D Chair,28D Chair_179,Q,It’s okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_18,Q,"No look, the other publications are fine."
28D Chair,28D Chair_180,A,It dropped out.
28D Chair,28D Chair_181,Q,"Yeah, I don’t know, but it’s okay. So the question was are there particular board functions that diversity can really help with, and if so can you give me an example?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_182,A,"Oh look, I think it’s probably in strategy and thinking about - deliberating on how will we tackle this segment? Or which direction should we take? That’s probably where the most value of diversity thinking comes into it. It’s not around so much how should we cut up the budget, or how are our financials going? It’s probably more around that real strategic thinking, and discussions and deliberations about our customers and our products, and what we’re going to do in the future, and what we should stop doing. That’s probably where the most value of a diverse background and thinking comes into it."
28D Chair,28D Chair_183,Q,Brilliant. And is there any type of function that diversity might limit or undermine?
28D Chair,28D Chair_184,A,I don’t think so.
28D Chair,28D Chair_185,Q,"Yep, beautiful."
28D Chair,28D Chair_186,A,I can’t see any time groupthink would be helpful.
28D Chair,28D Chair_187,Q,"Yeah, exactly, putting it that way. So now I’d like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards. Have you experienced, say when people are sharing their different perspectives and the diversity has created conflict?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_188,A,"Yeah, I have, and I think that’s where culture is important. So inviting diversity in the boardroom will invite different views, and without a respectful, inclusive culture that could create conflict. Now the last thing you want in the boardroom is conflict. You want good, challenging discussions but you don’t want conflict."
28D Chair,28D Chair_189,A,"And actually I have had an experience with a board where there was conflict between a couple of people, and it had been occurring a little bit. It was completely dysfunctional to the workings of the overall board, and once the conflict would start again, and everybody else would find it difficult to interject and speak, and it was so unhelpful. In the end the board got sick of it and it resulted in the termination of a director."
28D Chair,28D Chair_19,A,Okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_190,Q,Wow.
28D Chair,28D Chair_191,A,"Because people had lost confidence in them, because they couldn’t manage their – they couldn’t find a way around having differing views. So, absolutely."
28D Chair,28D Chair_192,A,"But you can have the most diverse board imaginable and it should work so long as your culture is respectful and inclusive. You’ve got to really - when you’re putting directors on it’s not only about their skillsets and their background and their diversity of thinking. It is also about do you have the values that are needed to encourage an inclusive and respectful culture? If you don’t, we’re going to have a problem."
28D Chair,28D Chair_193,Q,Fantastic. So how do you do that? How do you select people on that basis?
28D Chair,28D Chair_194,A,"It’s difficult, it’s not easy. But if I’m interviewing, you actually do want to understand how these people cope and resolved issues of conflict in the past. Now – so you do get a sense in talking to people how they’ve managed difficult situations, and the best you can do is understand what process they went through when they were faced with different conflicts. It’s not unlike executive interviewing in a way, that you’re trying to get a sense of that person and how they would deal in difficult situations, but it is difficult."
28D Chair,28D Chair_195,Q,"Okay, so interviews are an essential part. Do you outsource that component at all to the head-hunters, or is that something that the board would -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_196,A,"No, the board subcommittee does that. So the head-hunter can run – the recruiter can run the process of collecting applications and [referring] 00:49:26 you a long-list, but it’s always important for the board committee to do the interviews, subcommittee to do the interviews, and fundamentally it’s the board’s decision. So I don’t like being on a board where the nominations committee brings me a name and says ‘This is it, we’ve found it, please approve it.’ I want to see who are the top three to five, and what were they like, and why are you recommending this one to me? It is a board decision, we’re all responsible for working together, and I need to get a sense of the process that the committee went through on our behalf in narrowing it down to the top one."
28D Chair,28D Chair_197,Q,"And in that process do you want to see that they’ve considered diversity, or not? That’s irrelevant?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_198,A,"Yeah, I do, absolutely."
28D Chair,28D Chair_199,Q,"Would others be thinking along the same lines, or is it you’re a bit on your own there?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_2,A,"Yeah, sure, so originally accounting. I did a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in accounting at the ANU, and then I went on and became a CPA, I’m now a Fellow CPA. And then I studied, I did a Masters of Marketing and a Masters of Commercial Law as well."
28D Chair,28D Chair_20,Q,"I mean the academic ones are great as well, of course, but no, those two ones for the – because they give us contextual information and it’s a reference at least back to you and it can be updated in future."
28D Chair,28D Chair_200,A,"No, I think most – well, again it depends on the board. But I think many people are looking for aspects of diversity when they’re recruiting. There is only a couple of boards that I have been in contact with where that’s outside the thinking and it’s all about experience or something like that, and that’s all we need to be thinking about. So I think most boards now know that we have to think more broadly than just people that are like us."
28D Chair,28D Chair_201,Q,"Do you think the boards that do think that way, do you think that they perform better than the other ones, the ones that aren’t actively looking for diversity?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_202,A,"I do, because again I think that they – if you’re all thinking the same you’re going to come out with the same answer and there won’t be as much challenging or questioning or critical thinking and deliberation, potentially, if you’re all coming from the same background."
28D Chair,28D Chair_203,Q,And that impacts on strategy? You would see it in that area?
28D Chair,28D Chair_204,A,"It does, absolutely."
28D Chair,28D Chair_205,Q,"Yeah, because that’s -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_206,A,"It impacts on decision making, particularly strategic decision making about where we’re headed and how are we going to tackle this? How are we going to be ahead of our competitors? What are we going to do? There’s a myriad of things a board can decide to do, so what you have to do is work out - narrow that down and say what’s the most important thing, and how are we going to pull this off? And that’s the deliberations where the diversity can really add value."
28D Chair,28D Chair_207,Q,"Brilliant, okay, that’s great. Do people outside the board influence the selection? I mean, you’ve mentioned the recruitment organisation, is there anyone else?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_208,A,"Not really on my boards. Definitely on listed I think, yes, because fundamentally the shareholder base makes the appointment even though the board does all the work in putting the candidates up, but they will have a say, particularly around diversity. In my boards, the government boards of course are influenced by ministers and government departments, but really – for most of them no, it’s up to the board to get it right and there’s not really external pressure. The members of not-for-profits in my experience don’t exert a lot of pressure over the board."
28D Chair,28D Chair_209,Q,"Okay, good. You’re so clear, it’s wonderful, it’s beautiful."
28D Chair,28D Chair_21,A,"Yeah, sure, and I’m happy – so what I can do if you like I’ll email you the journal article - sorry, the article I have in the Company Directors magazine, but I can also email you the PhD itself if you like."
28D Chair,28D Chair_210,A,"Oh, thank you."
28D Chair,28D Chair_211,Q,"Thank you. Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process? Example, on the one hand trying to retain that collegiate fit for your culture, inclusive culture -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_212,A,Yes.
28D Chair,28D Chair_213,Q,-@ and on the other trying to avoid groupthink.
28D Chair,28D Chair_214,A,"I haven’t seen tension. I haven’t seen tension because what normally happens is the nominations committee will be tasked with going away, dealing with the recruiter, creating the short list, interviewing, and bringing the recommendation back to the board. It’s really unusual that the board would overturn that because – and it’s unusual that the – like the nominations committee, they have a discussion and come to a [landing] 00:53:56 on the preferred. There’s not really an argument about that. It’s unusual for a board to overturn it."
28D Chair,28D Chair_215,A,"But as I said before, I would be uncomfortable with only being brought one name, I would say ‘Where are the rest?’ So it’s not that I would seek to overturn their decision but I would want to understand who did you interview, and why is this one the one that you’re recommending to me as a board member? So no, I haven’t really seen conflicts over that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_216,Q,"Right, and so – but that idea of the inclusive culture, that’s so important, but then the diversity of thinking arising out of diverse backgrounds. If you’ve got two candidates, one who’s got such a fantastic – they’d be great contribution to your culture of respectful inclusiveness. And the other person, not so strong on that, but they have, I don’t know, international experience in blah blah blah and you think that would be really useful and – so there’s a tension between those two. So which candidate, which is the most important? So I guess has there ever been a tension between those two criteria?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_217,A,"Not that I recall specifically, no. I would like to think that the – I fear that the diversity one would be more visible and that’s the one we would go for, but I would hope that equally important would be the values the person holds. So you want those, you actually need those, so look harder if you can’t find those ones, is what I would say to that. Haven’t seen the tension where one played off against the other though."
28D Chair,28D Chair_218,Q,"Oh that’s good, yeah. Do the boards you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_219,A,Only the government ones where it’s out of our control and the minister makes the appointment.
28D Chair,28D Chair_22,Q,"Oh, no probably don’t do that, don’t do that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_220,Q,"Government appointments, obviously, yeah."
28D Chair,28D Chair_221,A,"I need to spell out actually, there’s a couple of things I’m speaking here on that might give my identity away, …… depending on the state you’re in and which government’s running your recruitment, but most of them say we want 50% of all the appointments for women. So Victoria does that, Queensland does that, I think national – I think federal government does that. …."
28D Chair,28D Chair_222,Q,"Yeah, okay. Let’s – I’ll put that as a note."
28D Chair,28D Chair_223,A,Yes.
28D Chair,28D Chair_224,Q,We can delete that – I’ll delete that you’re on a board where there’s -
28D Chair,28D Chair_225,A,"I don’t mind you saying I’m on a board where I’m on the only female, but I’m nervous about you saying that board is a government board."
28D Chair,28D Chair_226,Q,"Yeah, delete -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_227,A,If you could delete that part -
28D Chair,28D Chair_228,Q,"- government board, yeah."
28D Chair,28D Chair_229,A,"- then I’d be comfortable. and also if you just be careful about my research, because there’s no other research like that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_23,A,"Okay, no worries."
28D Chair,28D Chair_230,Q,"That’s why I don’t really want your – I don’t want to - at this stage I don’t want to look at your PhD, I don’t want to confound it."
28D Chair,28D Chair_231,A,"Yep, sure, no worries."
28D Chair,28D Chair_232,Q,"But the results, those three relationship, risk, and renumeration, if that’s relevant, is that already published in those magazines?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_233,A,"Yeah, it is."
28D Chair,28D Chair_234,Q,"Good, so that can be referenced."
28D Chair,28D Chair_235,A,"But if you’re saying Interviewee Five did research and found the three Rs and then that – if you’re saying Interviewee Five is on a board where she’s the only woman, that’s identifiable. Like, as soon as you say the results of the research people will know it’s me because no one else has researched that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_236,Q,"All right, delete government board with only one woman and don’t – and three Rs."
28D Chair,28D Chair_237,A,"Yeah, just don’t put the results being the three Rs. I’m happy for you to put that I’ve done research in government and [unclear] 00:58:06 listed companies, so if you just leave it at that, then [overtalk] 00:58:10"
28D Chair,28D Chair_238,Q,"Yeah, yeah, because those three Rs are not on our topic anyway, so it’s not a loss for us."
28D Chair,28D Chair_239,A,"No, that’s right."
28D Chair,28D Chair_24,Q,"Because that would be – well, let me see. The team, let’s - Paul can make that call."
28D Chair,28D Chair_240,Q,"So don’t worry about that. Yeah, okay, I’ve put that here for a note for myself when I’m deidentifying. Okay, good. Now we’re nearly there."
28D Chair,28D Chair_241,A,Okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_242,Q,"Now from a – well, hang on, so you’ve said about the government boards, for the not-for-profit boards are there – well, one barrier was when you’re looking for people from disadvantaged backgrounds there are financial barriers to them getting the – becoming competitive because they haven’t done their AICD course or whatever."
28D Chair,28D Chair_243,A,"Well that’s true, that’s true, and I think that’s a good point that whilst there isn’t probably direct influencing by other groups in who we should or shouldn’t appoint, there certainly is – there are inherent barriers. So really to be on a board, if you haven’t had a reasonable executive career you’re going to find it difficult, and equally that rules out young people too. So you - it already [unclear] 00:59:30 the door for you if you’ve got those characteristics. So does that mean that we shouldn’t look at those people? Not necessarily, but it does mean if we place those people we have to really support them and develop them to assist them, and make sure that they felt comfortable to share their views and that they were adequately trained in understanding obligations."
28D Chair,28D Chair_244,Q,"Yeah, okay, so build capacity whilst on the board, build capacity."
28D Chair,28D Chair_245,A,"In terms of the disadvantage, we – some of my boards are covering areas that are quite remote, and so we tend to like – we tend to have that group represented by people that are living in the regions. So whilst them themselves might not be of disadvantaged backgrounds, they are living within or close to disadvantaged communities."
28D Chair,28D Chair_246,Q,"Yep. Other people have said that if you want those different perspectives you can have advisory groups informing the board, so they don’t have to actually be on the board."
28D Chair,28D Chair_247,A,"We do have that too, yeah. We do have advisory community people."
28D Chair,28D Chair_248,Q,"Yeah, to bring those -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_249,A,"Again though, they’re likely to come from positions where they know about the advisory board and they know what it does, so they’re not – in terms of that community they’re not the most disadvantaged in that community by any means. They might be working with them but they’re not from that background."
28D Chair,28D Chair_25,A,"Yeah, no worries."
28D Chair,28D Chair_250,Q,"Yeah, good, okay. May contribute to conflict, we’ve done that. Do you know, this cognitive, this diverse thinking, before we move to the almost the last question, how might cognitive diversity be identified? Like you know, this diversity of thinking. Is there a way of identifying it, measuring it, monitoring it?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_251,A,"You tend to look at what people have – what they’ve done, where they’ve come from, where they’ve lived, what their work experience has been, what communities have they lived in? So it’s – you don’t test their thinking and their ability to think differently, but you’re making assumptions around well, this person has come from a really different background to us and we’ve not got anyone on the board like that before and they’ve lived in really remote areas or they’ve done things that we haven’t done, and so then you’re making the assumption that they will think differently because they’ve had a background that’s been different."
28D Chair,28D Chair_252,Q,"Yep, so it’s an assumption."
28D Chair,28D Chair_253,A,"And you further glean that in the interview. So you kind of ask questions, so you understand – get an understanding of how does this background help us, how will this thinking benefit us [unclear] 01:02:28 at the board level?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_254,Q,So really it’s not until interview that you can start to assess that?
28D Chair,28D Chair_255,A,"Absolutely, yeah. You can’t tell, I mean you get an idea from a resume but it’s not – you’ll get a lot more from an interview when you’re probing, asking probing questions, for sure."
28D Chair,28D Chair_256,Q,"Great. Do you think the last – like, the – has diversity changed over 10 years? You said gender not much, I think. Has anything -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_257,A,"Not in my experience. To be honest I’ve always had an indigenous person on [my] 01:03:17 board so my personal experience is no, it hasn’t changed greatly."
28D Chair,28D Chair_258,Q,"Good. Okay, the final question is looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_259,A,"I would love to see more people with disability on boards, more people with an indigenous background, more people that live in remote areas of Australia, more people with varied ethnic backgrounds and understanding, and absolutely more women. Wouldn’t it be nice to think that we could look at a board and see 50% woman, and that would be the norm? And that that’s what appears on most not-for-profits unlisted government boards. I think then you wouldn’t have situations where there are still boards with no woman, or one or two. And as a woman you do feel that you’re not quite one of them. You don’t want people feeling like that, you want people – you want to genuinely have a good representation of society on the boards that are managing the organisations of our country. Why wouldn’t you want that?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_26,Q,They can make that call.
28D Chair,28D Chair_260,Q,"Yeah, look at our governments. So I guess, why do you think it would be good to have someone from a remote area for example on an ASX listed company, why would that be good?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_261,A,"Because you - our governments are run by people who live in capital cities. Our major companies are run by people who live in capital cities. The decisions for all of Australia are made by people who live in metropolitan areas. They don’t – so people that don’t live in major areas and who have a very different experience in their work and their lives are not represented adequately, I don’t think, in government departments, and they’re not represented adequately in large companies, and decisions are being made on their behalf. It is - geographical diversity is an important issue."
28D Chair,28D Chair_262,A,"Many of our governments are recognising that, and they would like to see more geographically diverse people on boards but I think we have a way to go. And I think that if metropolitan people think that they know what’s best for country people then I think that they’re probably mistaken. So I would really like to see that [unclear] 01:06:15 Wouldn’t it be great to have people living in outback Northern Territory trained up and ready to sit on government boards and, heaven forbid, listed company boards?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_263,Q,"Yeah, I get you. With technology, digital technology communication, do you think that this will – we’ve got it for distance education as well, so do you think that this might be a way of achieving that goal?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_264,A,"Absolutely. I live in a regional area, and I – it is – boards don’t care where you live. They fly you in to the board meeting, and when you’re not there you work at home. And the reality is that in most of Australia there is enough coverage to mean that you can work from home, and that’s only going to increase with better use of satellite technology. So it’s only going to get easier for us."
28D Chair,28D Chair_265,A,"So I think absolutely it’s very possible, and we should be looking more to it. You don’t have to be there 40 hours a week if you’re on a board, in fact you shouldn’t be. So why can’t you fly into a capital city and go to a board meeting, and then be working from home the rest of the time?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_266,Q,"Yep, yep, in your outback whatever, exactly."
28D Chair,28D Chair_267,A,Yeah.
28D Chair,28D Chair_268,Q,"Exactly. Look, Participant 28D thank you."
28D Chair,28D Chair_269,A,"You look at the burgeoning cities, they’re a big problem. Look at Sydney. The roads are increasingly busier, there are apartment blocks going up everywhere, and the infrastructure isn’t quite keeping up. So a lot of people are finding [inaudible] 01:08:07 Sydney. So there is a definite push, and I think governments should be more proactive with decentralisation of departments to get people out into the regional areas. Something has to give here, and we’ve got a vast continent which is largely uninhabited in the middle, so smart thinking would tell you that we should be able to work from home more in regional centres."
28D Chair,28D Chair_27,A,Okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_270,Q,"Great. Look Participant 28D, that was so good. I am so grateful, thank you so much."
28D Chair,28D Chair_271,A,"Pleasure, it was lovely to speak with you."
28D Chair,28D Chair_272,Q,"It was fabulous, a fabulous interview."
28D Chair,28D Chair_273,A,"Great, excellent."
28D Chair,28D Chair_274,Q,So have you any more questions – have you any questions or we’ll just sign off?
28D Chair,28D Chair_275,A,"No, no I’m really happy. Just keeping in mind what we talked about in terms of -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_276,Q,"Yep, deidentifying? Yep."
28D Chair,28D Chair_277,A,- deidentifying. [unclear] 01:08:58 people that are in my situation living and working regionally on boards and have done that research and [inaudible] 01:09:04 is one of the probably only government boards with only one woman.
28D Chair,28D Chair_278,Q,Yeah.
28D Chair,28D Chair_279,A,"But that’s great, apart from that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_28,Q,"But certainly for me if I have those other ones that’d be great and I’ll note that the PhD, that you’re willing to send it."
28D Chair,28D Chair_280,Q,You sure you don’t want me to send the transcript so that you can check? It’s -
28D Chair,28D Chair_281,A,"No, I’m happy with that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_282,Q,"Oh, good on you, okay."
28D Chair,28D Chair_283,A,I think that’s fine.
28D Chair,28D Chair_284,Q,I’ll take care.
28D Chair,28D Chair_285,A,Okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_286,Q,Thanks a lot Participant 28D.
28D Chair,28D Chair_287,A,"Thanks, bye."
28D Chair,28D Chair_288,Q,Bye bye.
28D Chair,28D Chair_289,Q,END OF TRANSCRIPT
28D Chair,28D Chair_29,A,"Yeah sure, no trouble."
28D Chair,28D Chair_3,A,"And in my work life I started in finance and accounting, but then moved into IT and strategy and did a little bit of lecturing in marketing, so it actually is multi-disciplinary which is a lot of the reason that I – or part of the reason that I decided that having such a multi-disciplinary background would be useful to do board work."
28D Chair,28D Chair_30,Q,"Good, okay.  So Australian boards director, how many years have you been sitting on Australian boards?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_31,A,"Seven years, since 2012."
28D Chair,28D Chair_32,Q,"Wow, excellent. And - so 2012, good. And how many do you currently sit on?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_33,A,"I’m on – seven [unclear] 00:04:04 boards, and that’s a mixture of government boards and companies, unlisted companies, and not-for-profits. And I also sit on a further – oh, seven? Yeah, I said seven. And I also sit on a few others that are non-renumerated. So one is the Royal Flying Doctor Service, another one is – I sit on some boards and committees for the Catholic Diocese of Bathurst, and also I chair the Australian Institute of Company Directors Western Region committee which meets quarterly as well. So they’re not technically boards, some of those, but they’re committees and things."
28D Chair,28D Chair_34,Q,"Oh, brilliant. Quite a scope. But no listed companies as yet?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_35,A,"No listed, no, no, that’s right."
28D Chair,28D Chair_36,Q,"That’s good, that’s good. And how many boards have you sat on altogether?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_37,A,"I would say, oh goodness. I would say around 15, probably, in my time."
28D Chair,28D Chair_38,Q,"Yeah, and would any of those have been listed?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_39,A,"No, never sat on a listed one, no."
28D Chair,28D Chair_4,Q,Definitely. And I noticed you have a PhD in board governance.
28D Chair,28D Chair_40,Q,"Yeah, that’s okay. But your research was in that area?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_41,A,"Yeah, no, that’s right, it was. And it’s very interesting because it’s given me a big appreciation for listed boards, and I think I thought prior to doing my research that would be where I aspired to end up, and now I’m not [unclear] 00:05:44 on that anymore. I might, but I would think so carefully about what listed board I chose to take on I think because it is a whole new challenge around many things such as disclosure, and I just think – I suspect one day I’ll probably end up on a listed company, but I’m not rushing into it like I thought I might previously."
28D Chair,28D Chair_42,Q,So what are the differences in term of disclosure that worry you?
28D Chair,28D Chair_43,A,"Oh well you don’t have to disclose, there’s no continuous disclosure obligations if you’re not on a listed board. And so - but of course on listed companies there are, and you have to get that right. And as a board director one of the things that was loud and clear to me was that directors, they’re not there every day, they are heavily reliant on the executive for information and resources and things that enable them to complete their all obligations, not only disclosure. So you are heavily reliant, and if you don’t – you can easily get it wrong if you’re not being supported adequately, and the buck stops with you as the director."
28D Chair,28D Chair_44,A,"So I think it is – and the adequacy and the accuracy of the financials, I mean that’s [unclear] 00:07:15 with unlisted as well, but there is a whole lot of [unclear] 00:07:20. And additionally you’ve got shareholders at AGMs that – and you’ve got major shareholders that are increasing their shareholdings and they are wielding, I suppose, a level of power over these organisations that particularly they haven’t had in the past before. So that is an added complexity that you don’t have when you’re not on a listed board."
28D Chair,28D Chair_45,Q,"Okay, good. And do any of those influence diversity or it’s irrelevant, your concerns?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_46,A,The complexities of what I’ve talked about? Or -
28D Chair,28D Chair_47,Q,"Yes, yeah. Your reasons for holding back on – so a difference you perceive between listed and non-listed companies, is there any impact on diversity or it’s really those other concerns?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_48,A,"I think it’s those other concerns. I think what we’re seeing since the – I mean, I’m happy all boards, including listed companies, have now been under significant pressure to sort out their lack of diversity on boards over the years. And now we see ASX200 companies, I think they’re at 30% now, which was the goal. Well, now major – well, major organisations such as [unclear] 00:08:39 are now saying ‘we want more than that’, so I think they’re pushing harder, which I think is right."
28D Chair,28D Chair_49,A,"So I think because listed companies do have – there are major shareholders that are wielding significant power, as they are in the public eye they have to find the right people to make up the best boards, otherwise they’re going to continue to be under pressure. And you see that with the three or whatever it is left of the ASX200 companies that don’t have any women, and they’re continuously – their names comes up, that they should have done something a bit better by now and that issue won’t go away. And I think if anything they are more in the spotlight when it comes to seeking diversity on their boards."
28D Chair,28D Chair_5,A,"I do and that was completed - early this year it was conferred, and that was on – it was a qualitative study where I interviewed 41 ASX200 directors on how they govern under the ASX Corporate Governance Council principals and recommendations. So it was very interesting indeed, I have to say, and it was a good experience actually."
28D Chair,28D Chair_50,A,"It’s interesting in my research when I asked directors about their recommendations around diversity, and also about appointment and re-appointment, and they talked about - basically my findings show that there were two schools of thought around diversity. Sorry, around recruitment to boards across the ASX200. And one school of thought was around that you should use existing networks and you should talk to people about who do they know. So you need the ability to be able to ask somebody that you trust about this person, or if it’s them themselves, because it’s too risky to end up with someone on the board that doesn’t work out, because you can’t get rid of directors easily if they’re – if it’s not working. And because we are all collectively responsible, it’s really important that you can work together."
28D Chair,28D Chair_51,A,"And the second school of thought was in complete contrast, and it was basically, well, no, I don’t accept it when – I go to recruiters and I ask them for good names, and if they come back with all men, I say ‘I don’t accept that, you need to go look harder and cast the net wider and find me people, because there have to be women out there that would be suitable for my board’. So they were very much saying that’s a cop-out first of all. No, you’re not looking hard enough, and don’t tell us that you have to play it safe and get known commodities on the board to make sure it works."
28D Chair,28D Chair_52,A,So I think there is definitely – the tide is changing and there is now not one school of thought around how you recruit but there is two. But there’s still old-world thinking perhaps around playing it safe and getting known people on the board.
28D Chair,28D Chair_53,Q,"That’s very interesting. So the people who thought using the network to play it safe, were they – did you find any reason to justify this distinction or to explain it? Was it a demographic difference, was -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_54,A,"No, it wasn’t, and it wasn’t really a gender difference. I [think that] (this participant drew these findings (Three rs: relationship, risk and remuneration) from her PHD which she is willing to give us access if you wish)…..ASX200 directors predominantly focus relationships, risk, and renumeration. And relationships is about …….effective working relationships between board members, and with the executive, and with key stakeholders. And without those relationships working and the presence of trust and things like that, that you actually can’t govern effectively because you’re not there every day. So you do have to have those relationships in place to be able to trust people to get your job done."
28D Chair,28D Chair_55,A,"And risk was about the danger of getting it wrong, and that – it was about internal risk and external risk. External being what’s coming over the horizon at me that I hadn’t predicted? What new competitor is going to pop up tomorrow with a brand new business model that will disrupt mine? But it’s also about the risk of things internally, so things like the presence of fraud or unethical behaviour, or things that I’m being assured everything’s okay but it’s sort of not."
28D Chair,28D Chair_56,A,"And I think the school of thought around appointment of board directors and playing it safe and going for people in your network, or connected to someone in your network, is very much around that relationship thing, and it’s around making sure that the person you’re going to get you can work with, you can have a trusting and effective relationship with. Now, they didn’t indicate that what it meant was that [they’d think] 00:13:10 of getting someone like me, they indicated that it was important to be able to work collectively – in a collegial fashion as a group because collectively you are all responsible."
28D Chair,28D Chair_57,Q,"Yeah, yeah. So what was the third? I’ve got relationship, risk and -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_58,A,Renumeration. So the third -
28D Chair,28D Chair_59,Q,Sorry?
28D Chair,28D Chair_6,Q,"Brilliant. Oh, have you published from that research?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_60,A,"Renumeration. It wasn’t [inaudible] 00:13:41 It was all about, and it was probably the biggest surprise for me in the findings, but what it was about was really the process that now exists with this two-strikes rules is that the shareholder base has the ability to vote the board down, to vote – sorry, to give a strike on the remuneration, on the executive remuneration [unclear] 00:14:08 and if there’s two strikes then the board is essentially voted down. And so there is – and directors really feel that [that is – that significant power of the shareholder base and the main shareholders] 00:14:20 is significant, and it’s really influencing the process of getting executive remuneration. And essentially they’re saying you’ve got to get go us [inaudible] 00:14:32 everyone else is doing, and that takes away your ability to structure short term incentives and long term incentives in the way that you would like to, to motivate your executive. And if you don’t do that then you are not as likely to get a vote passed for your rem, but two of those strikes and the board is dissolved."
28D Chair,28D Chair_61,A,"And they also felt that the whole process is a [bit role in that benchmarking] [unclear] 00:14:58 the public concern around the executive rem being high, or about it being high, [unclear] 00:15:20 higher than the other salaries."
28D Chair,28D Chair_62,Q,"Participant 28D, we’ve got a bit of a problem with the sound it’s deteriorated, the audio, the quality of the audio, and I’m concerned that the transcribers won’t be able to pick up your words."
28D Chair,28D Chair_63,A,Okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_64,Q,"It’s like it’s falling out, we’re missing occasional words."
28D Chair,28D Chair_65,A,"Okay, so I did move. I’ll move -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_66,Q,"Oh, much better."
28D Chair,28D Chair_67,A,"Oh is that better? No problem, I’ll stay here then."
28D Chair,28D Chair_68,Q,"Yeah, much better, yeah, yeah."
28D Chair,28D Chair_69,A,Okay.
28D Chair,28D Chair_7,A,In process.
28D Chair,28D Chair_70,Q,"And maybe – that’s great, good. I better – we’ll work on the questions now, I was just following on what you were saying from the beginning."
28D Chair,28D Chair_71,A,Sure.
28D Chair,28D Chair_72,Q,"But let’s see, how have the composition of the boards that you’re familiar with changed over the seven years that you’ve been a director, in terms of diversity?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_73,A,"To be honest in my board I personally haven’t – it’s not significantly more gender diverse now than it was back in 2012. Some of my boards are genuinely gender equal, if not gender equal I think even one of them has slightly more women than men, and that contrasts to another of my boards which I am the only female. So – and that’s – so I haven’t seen a significant increase in females on the boards that I sit on in my seven years. I can say that -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_74,Q,"Can I just ask you, the one – is there a difference because they are government boards are more gender diverse than say not-for-profit, or the unlisted companies? Is there -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_75,A,"No, I don’t find that."
28D Chair,28D Chair_76,Q,"Okay, perfect, good. And so we’re interested in other kinds of diversity, so is there – are they structured with a mind for other diversities, other kinds of diversity?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_77,A,"We do have – I do sit on a board with – two of my boards have indigenous directors on them, and I find that incredibly insightful, and we’re very lucky to have capable indigenous people at the board level. I also do have on my board a little bit of an ethnic background diversity as well."
28D Chair,28D Chair_78,Q,Excellent. So are you a chair of any of these boards?
28D Chair,28D Chair_79,A,"I am a chair of one committee. Oh sorry, I do chair a number of finance committees but I also do chair one committee for the [AICD] 00:18:06"
28D Chair,28D Chair_8,Q,"Good, okay."
28D Chair,28D Chair_80,Q,"That’s good because in the interviews I’ve done, the role of the chair is very strategic in some of these questions so it’d be good – it’s good to know that you do a chair role because we can drill down on that. What does board diversity mean to you, before we move on any further?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_81,A,"So board diversity whilst it – really what it means is diversity of thinking, and diversity of background and experience and thinking that’s brought to the table, and that - really for me gender diversity, ethnicity, and age diversity are all enablers of the [former.] 00:18:55 So really we know that men and women think differently, we know that people with an indigenous background have a very different experience of life, and we know that equally the same applies with different ethnic backgrounds."
28D Chair,28D Chair_82,A,"So what you are getting is not a board that looks different and has - when you look at a picture they all look different and like they come from different backgrounds, but fundamentally that they think differently, they come from different experiences and backgrounds and skillsets and that together they respect each other’s views and ideas that they bring to the table, and collectively you can leverage off that very broad skills base to make the most effective decisions."
28D Chair,28D Chair_83,Q,"Excellent, that’s great, thanks. That’s a nice model there. How important do you think it is to have a diverse board to produce this sort of thinking?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_84,A,"It is incredibly important. Now let me just confirm, my name won’t appear in any quotes will it?"
28D Chair,28D Chair_85,Q,Sorry?
28D Chair,28D Chair_86,A,I’m sure that – my name won’t appear across any quotes?
28D Chair,28D Chair_87,Q,"Oh no, I’ll deidentify it by name and if you’re concerned about other factors revealing – making you easily identified -"
28D Chair,28D Chair_88,A,Yes.
28D Chair,28D Chair_89,Q,"- I will send the transcript to you, and you can check."
28D Chair,28D Chair_9,A,"So I have published an article for the Company Director magazine, which is the AICD magazine. I actually had a phone call and message this morning from the Governance Institute, they want me to publish in their magazine. But in addition I’ve just met with one of my supervisors and I’m working towards publishing in a corporate governance academic journal as well, so I hope to have that done this year sometime."
28D Chair,28D Chair_90,A,"Sure. So long as my name won’t appear, [so nobody knows that I’ve participated in the study, I’m fine with it.] 00:20:15"
28D Chair,28D Chair_91,Q,Good.
28D Chair,28D Chair_92,A,"So how important is diversity? It’s critical. In the case where I’m the only female on the board, it is an incredibly different experience for me on that board than it is with most of my other boards. Now what I mean by that is they – my colleagues are incredibly polite and respectful, but I do have a sense that I’m not one of them. Now, that does not bother me to the point where I think I shouldn’t be there. Quite the contrary, I think I should stay. And I think I should keep operating the way I do and that they should have to suffer me, because I’m one person that’s not male and actually they should have more of me around, or more women."
28D Chair,28D Chair_93,A,"Now they are never rude to me, they never don’t want to hear my opinion. I think sometimes I feel like they’re tolerating me, and that if they had their way that they would rather have another of their friends there. But – so it’s just the undercurrent I think. I probably didn’t sense it quite as much when there were two of us when I first joined the board, but that certainly is the way – the sense I slightly have now, as opposed to other boards where there are 50% women."
28D Chair,28D Chair_94,A,"And one of my boards in particular is very strong in gender advocacy, and on that board it feels not only celebrated that we have gender equality at our board level and certainly across I believe a lot of our executive model, but it is encouraged that we find and promote great women to be part of the leadership of that company. So it does feel incredibly different. I think not only from – that’s my personal perspective, but in terms of the conversation. It’s a different conversation, it’s a different feeling in the room when you have 50% women as opposed to 10%."
28D Chair,28D Chair_95,Q,"Participant 28D, one interviewee, it was a male, and he said ‘I would not apply for a board position if there wasn’t gender diversity because it’s a sign that it’s a conservative board and I wouldn’t fit.’"
28D Chair,28D Chair_96,A,"Yeah, yep."
28D Chair,28D Chair_97,Q,What do you think of that?
28D Chair,28D Chair_98,A,"I think he’s in an increasing group of men that have got it right. And I think he’s right, I think that many men that I’ve worked with they actively do seek good women for their boards. And they genuinely believe, they’re not just doing it for tokenism, they’re doing it because it’s the right thing for the company. As well as looking good externally it predominantly is the right, good, thing for the company."
28D Chair,28D Chair_99,A,"Not all men are like that. There are some incredibly conservative men that are old-school whose wives probably never worked, and they do – the undercurrent and feeling is that any female on the board is potentially taking the place of a talented male."
29D,29D_1,A,"Yes, and X won’t be mentioned, although –"
29D,29D_10,Q,14 years.
29D,29D_100,A,Yes? That gas line -
29D,29D_101,Q,-@ I used your pipes.
29D,29D_102,A,"Yes. Right? Although the majority of the pipe go to LNG plants, and they export gas to Asia. So Michael’s got that deep understanding. But actually the rest of us aren’t from the gas industry. And I think it’s an outstanding board."
29D,29D_103,Q,Tell me why. Why?
29D,29D_104,A,"Because we’ve all got different views. Number one, you’ve got those two outstanding women on them – Debbie Goodin and Shirley In’t Veld. We’ve got a different set of experiences in terms of our business careers. And when we sit around the board we’ve got differences of perspectives. And actually, where Michael is such a great chair, he seeks that out. And everyone respects the differences. No one speaks over each other, so it’s valued. That diversity around the board is truly valued. And because of that more of it comes out. And that’s the benefit of diversity, right?"
29D,29D_105,Q,"This has been a thread as well, you’ve just touched on, which is the cXcity for the board to include the different perspectives. Because without that cXcity your diversity is sort of lost. Can you talk a bit more about that?"
29D,29D_106,A,"Yes, so you don’t want to fill the board up with people who have come from the industry. I’m also not an advocate of actually filling the board up with ex-CEOs. Although you maybe want one. I’m the contemporary CEO. But you do want relevant experience, right? If you look at our board, I guess I bring – going back – the reason why they’ve asked me to join the X board is X is looking at globalising – an Australian company looking at globalising. Obviously we successfully did that back in Incitec. There are too many Australian businesses that have successfully globalised. So I’m bringing that global perspective to the board. Obviously Michael brings his gas experience. Peter Wasow ran Alumina, so he brings deep experience around really heavy manufacturing, if you like, and commodity markets."
29D,29D_107,A,"You’ve got Debbie Goodin, and Debbie chairs our audit committee. Debbie’s an ex-chartered firm, so she brings that professional services perspective. Steve is an ex-investment banker. So – and Shirley ran a gas retailer. So she brings a customer perspective – a customer’s perspective. So if you think about the skills and experience, it’s very diverse. And that’s why the board works so well. And of course, management bring the deep experience of the business and industry. So it’s interesting. We’ve just recruited a new CEO, and I think it was Steve who said – and Michael, they reflected on how different the interviews were, as different board members. Because we initially, obviously, it’s – the appointments committee will interview."
29D,29D_108,A,"And then it’s the full board that will do the final interview, in terms of once a shortlist – in fact, actually, the directors from the appointments committee shows not to make – ask any questions when the full board was interviewing the candidates, because the questions we were asking were so different and so rich, and questions they just wouldn’t ask. Obviously I – being such a relatively new contemporary CEO, my questions were very different to – and that’s the gift of diversity, isn’t it? Now, of course, where I think gender plays such a significant role is I do think gender is almost a magic X in all of that. Because thinking life experiences for women are different to men. And that’s the gift of having more – having a more balanced diversity on the board in terms of gender. Right? And you see that."
29D,29D_109,Q,"Do you see that in your – is it Rebecca? Yes, do you see that in her? Because that’s a very rational background -"
29D,29D_11,A,And – pretty much fully since then.
29D,29D_110,A,"- you do, because once again – Well, it’s Debbie Goodin on our – she’s had a different experience. in fact, she’s obviously been a bit of a trailblazer, because to get senior in a chartered firm – my wife sits on the executive board of PWC. and I can remember she was the first female partner in Melbourne, in that organisation. and So once again she brings that piece of experience. you know, I’m a huge believer in weight of numbers. So if you put one woman on a board, you don’t get the bang that if you put two."
29D,29D_111,Q,Why’s that?
29D,29D_112,A,"The dynamic – it’s quite hard – because of course you're bringing not only – you’re bringing the experience, and one of the contexts of that is being a woman, right? It’s hard when you're just one of eight. When you’re two of eight you get more space, I think. Men have this horrible habit of talking over women, right?"
29D,29D_113,Q,Are we talking specifically about – have you observed this -?
29D,29D_114,A,"- Yes, on boards. So it was quite interesting, as CEO, when I had just Rebecca join the board. The difference was less than when Kathryn joined the board. And I’m a huge believer in – it’s why actually I’ve got a fair bit of sympathy for maybe some quotas, because it’s not until you get a critical mass that -"
29D,29D_115,Q,-@ that you get the effect.
29D,29D_116,A,Yes.
29D,29D_117,Q,"So part of that board being inclusive is that you’ve got the numbers. But this seems to be gender. For example, you might have one person from a financial background, and then that doesn’t happen. But with gender, it does. So it’s a bit different."
29D,29D_118,A,"Yes, if you have – and one is not sufficient. You start to get a difference with two. You’ll see a huge change if there are two -"
29D,29D_119,Q,"- women? you’re talking gender, yes."
29D,29D_12,Q,"Good. That’s a good period to look at change, so that would be great. And were they different boards?"
29D,29D_120,A,Yes.
29D,29D_121,Q,"Yes, and is it – with three – is it exponential? Or two’s enough, and then you start to – it happens?"
29D,29D_122,A,Two is quite different.
29D,29D_123,Q,What is it? What is it then? How does – what makes a difference? Can you flesh it out for me?
29D,29D_124,A,"From a CEO’s perspective, when I was sitting there, I guess – think about what happens at a board meeting. So at a typical board meeting the CEO is probably going to – CEO/management are probably going to speak half the time. And then by the time you deal with reports from committees, et cetera, that’s probably another 10-15% - maybe 10%. And then by the time you take presentations from externals, that’s another couple of per cent. So if you actually think about it, as a non-executive director you might get to ask four questions, maybe. If you think about the space. So I guess it’s just maybe about the power of numbers. Four questions have been asked. Now, if you think about those questions, to the extent that they bring the gift that comes with actually not only having a different experience, but having an experience from a woman’s perspective, maybe it’s two. Maybe it’s one."
29D,29D_125,A,"So I think it’s just the weight of the amount of questions that are asked. And I think then of course – I think you pick up the difference if it’s asked a couple of times from that perspective. So I think it’s weight of numbers. I don’t know. It’s not a very good answer, is it? But it is weight of numbers."
29D,29D_126,Q,"No-no-no, it’s really interesting. You’ve used two words here – one’s the perspective – that’s gender – and the other one is different experience. And that’s also – and both of these are diversity. But they’re fundamentally different things. And one you need the weight of number, the perspectives. And I’m thinking, because there’s politics around groupings of people – it’s a social phenomenon – that might be what perspective is tapping into. And you need a weight, otherwise you’ll have marginalisation, blah-blah-blah. So that’s a social phenomenon. Whereas experience, it’s a descriptor, and it links really to the functions -"
29D,29D_127,A,"- Yes, more of the functional experience, doesn’t it? Sorry, functional background."
29D,29D_128,Q,"Yes, and then the task of the board to – I suppose – so it’s not a social phenomena as much as it’s providing inputs to decision making. Yes. So maybe – I haven’t read anything about this, but those two words, you just naturally use them to divide that field. But it sort of makes it -"
29D,29D_129,A,"- and remember, what a board does too is a board just doesn’t sit in the boardroom. a board goes out into the business. and this is where having gender diversity just allows the board to shine, because I’ve got to Say, when Kathryn – Kathryn chaired the HSE committee, and Rebecca was also on that. So HSE committees tend to be the ones that will do more site visits."
29D,29D_13,A,Oh wow. When I first – so I first joined the board of Incitec Pivot as an executive director – as a finance director. Way back then there was one woman that was on the board.
29D,29D_130,Q,HSE committees?
29D,29D_131,A,"Health, safety and environment."
29D,29D_132,Q,"Right, of course, yes. Yes."
29D,29D_133,A,"Because you can’t learn about safety culture from the boardroom. It’s impossible. So if you look at the committees that a board – obviously a board will do a site visit once a year, but typically the HSE committees will do maybe three, yes."
29D,29D_134,Q,Okay.
29D,29D_135,A,"And just the difference in the ability of that committee to relate to people on site. And just the experience of the business, in having the HSE committee on site, and the value that committee added when it was much more diverse, it was quite a stark – because – now, once again, this will – there’s an element of this where, if you're not careful, you’ll end up role-stereotyping. But Kathryn and Rebecca were just so much better than some of the other men in asking challenging questions, but in a way where the people on the other end always felt comfortable with the question having been asked."
29D,29D_136,Q,"Yes, they didn’t react."
29D,29D_137,A,"Yes, and actually – whereas men can ask a question where the person on the other end of it ends up walking away, feeling like an idiot. And it’s just those skills. And once again, I’m almost hesitating a bit, because this is stereotyping women. But it’s just the far richer – and so I always used to think, “Thank goodness we had Kathryn and Rebecca on site.” Because of course, when you want – as a CEO, the gift of having the board on site is number one – going back to the first question – the first comment – they’re asking questions you’d never ask as CEO. And there’s a phenomenon in safety, which we used to call “gorillas”. Have you ever seen the film where people are playing basketball, and you look at the film and there’s a gorilla that comes on and off but you don’t see it?"
29D,29D_138,Q,"No, but -"
29D,29D_139,A,"- Well, in terms of safety, the risk is that in terms of a site will be people – the people will turn up to site every day, because you actually don’t see change. and the reason why you want new people coming on the site is they’ll see things that you don’t, right? That’s the gift. and So That’s why you want board visits, because That’s where the board adds value, and of course the board also does its assurance processes and looks at culture. but it’s that difference of opinion. but not only do you want that gift, but you want it in a way that actually management feel comfortable to be open. and where actually they’re happy to do some learning, because That’s the whole point, right?"
29D,29D_14,Q,"Oh right, okay."
29D,29D_140,A,"And having some more diversity means actually the same – the impact’s still there, and things are pulled up if they need to be. But in a way where things get done, because it’s not in an offensive way. It’s more of a teaching in an encouraging way. Once again, that’s the gift."
29D,29D_141,Q,"Yes, now, look, this gift that you're talking about, which is, once again, it’s a social phenomenon – it’s a social skill – and you’re attributing it to gender, to female. Is this because – you know the operations of this business. Are they predominantly male?"
29D,29D_142,A,"Yes, because remember I was – fertilisers and explosives, it’s men. And out on site, so if you looked at Incitec it’s 16% women. If you took away the functional, out on site it’s 10%. If you go out on a mine site it might be 1%."
29D,29D_143,Q,"Yes, so we need to test this emerging concept, which is fantastic, because we want to build a model, with a business that’s not so male dominated. Because a social phenomena, once you’ve got - a woman talking and observing in a male culture is very different to maybe a male, because it might trigger competitiveness or whatever. And that’s just a social phenomena. So it mightn’t be that Rebecca and Kathryn have these fantastic skills. It might be that – well, they do have good skills – but it mightn’t be any better than some of the men. But in this context it works well because of the gender mix. So we need to try to test that in a – I’m nearly at the end of my interviews. I need to try and find someone who’s in a big, ASX company, who can -"
29D,29D_144,A,"It may be a – I don’t know, maybe a bank – no, banks actually are just as -"
29D,29D_145,Q,"Yes, the big ones are sort of a bit male-dominated, aren’t they? Anyway, let’s keep on with this interview. But this is really interesting. This can be – this is a pilot. We can look for it in the next stage. Do you think there’s any situation that a company can face where you would change your rating of diversity as being [ten] 00:40:35?"
29D,29D_146,A,"Not in terms of what a board brings, and what the role of a board is."
29D,29D_147,Q,"Yes, so maybe if it’s a really uncertain situation, or high-risk? What do you think?"
29D,29D_148,A,"That ability to ask different questions – if you think of uncertainty, high-risk, what you want to do is you want to think about the business through a prism of a number of possible scenarios. That’s what diversity brings, right?"
29D,29D_149,Q,"Yes, yes, exactly. That’s what I wanted to hear. Yes. Everyone is saying this – this is so good. So – okay, what does diversity mean to you? How do you define it in your head?"
29D,29D_15,A,"And now if you compare that – and then – when did Barbara step down? And for a long – I think she stepped down in – no-no, she stepped off when I was appointed. So there was zero."
29D,29D_150,A,"Yes, I think it’s just difference of life experiences, and opinions, and views."
29D,29D_151,Q,"Yes, yes. What about approaches to problem solving? It’s a bit of a term called cognitive diversity – different ways of problem solving?"
29D,29D_152,A,"Yes, I think you also find that, because it’s – you do think differently. And I think partly your approach to problem solving, it tends to be – you tend to problem solve in a way that you've found has worked. And once again, yes, having everyone in the room who thinks the same, you come up with one solution, which – and where I think it’s different is if you look historically in business, a lot of problems were technical problems. So if you had a solution they could have been complex, in terms of their solution. But there still was a problem with a solution. If we think about where the world’s going now, and think about an overlay of stuff like AI, anything that requires a technical solution will be automated, right?"
29D,29D_153,A,"And so will likely end up with problems that require more of an adaptive solution, or where there are multiple solutions, or actually where there’s no solution. And you need to iterate to find that. Once again, if you think about that change, boy, having a bunch of people sitting around the board who all think the same, that’s a great way to destroy a business, isn’t it?"
29D,29D_154,Q,"Yes, high-risk."
29D,29D_155,A,"So I think if you think about the change in the nature of business, the case for more diversity is even broader, right?"
29D,29D_156,Q,"And you gave – you opened with that really great example of where lack of diversity actually endangers – can endanger the business. So that was a really good example. Now, the gender diversity has been debated for a while. And you’re a Male Champion of Change. How do you feel about the recent inclusion of this ethnicity, sexual orientations, things like that?"
29D,29D_157,A,"The reason why I think – the reason why we’ve started with gender is you've got to start somewhere, right? But the lessons that we’re learning as a group are equally as applicable. But I guess it was – yes, so I’ve never seen male Champions of Change being anything other than a broader change – in bringing a broader change. And it just happens to be we’re starting with gender. And what I would hope is it broadens, right?"
29D,29D_158,Q,To what?
29D,29D_159,A,"To all the elements of diversity. It’s probably the only area where the US is more ahead of us, Australia, because obviously you’re actually legally forced to report on that broader slate. So I think it’s just we had to start somewhere, and that’s what we’ve started on."
29D,29D_16,Q,"14 years ago, zero women. How many directors?"
29D,29D_160,Q,"Okay, so with, say, sexual orientation and ethnicity, would you see those as perspectives or as different experience?"
29D,29D_161,A,I think it is different experience.
29D,29D_162,Q,"So it’s different experience, not perspective? So we’re not going to – this separation of experience and perspective is not really going to hold for you, is it?"
29D,29D_163,A,No.
29D,29D_164,Q,"Okay, good. We’ll throw that in the bin. Does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others, do you think? And why? Or does it depend on the situation?"
29D,29D_165,A,"No, I actually don’t think – I think it – so, as I’ve described it, [inaudible] 00:45:37 diversity of thought."
29D,29D_166,Q,"Yes, so it’s just – yes. So if it’s diversity of thought then the other things are a means to that end, and -"
29D,29D_167,A,"- Yes, for me it’s not the fact that we’ve got men and women. it’s the fact that that mix and evening up that mix means you have got far better diversity of thought. So Yes, I’m – So it’s almost the shortcut to getting better diversity of thought."
29D,29D_168,Q,"Yes, so now we’re moving towards functioning, which is really important. Because how do you manage the potential for conflict, or dis-function? Because you’ve got so many different points of view, perspectives?"
29D,29D_169,A,"well, it’s to respect those differences. And ultimately that’s what a chair does, right? So a chair says very little in a board meeting, until you’re able to bring that together – until, sorry, if there was an impasse. But there really is an impasse on a board, because if you think about a board, it’s – if you look at what a well-functioning board is, you seek out those differences, right? So you value them more. In fact, if you don’t – if I don’t – as a CEO, if I didn’t hear them, I thought, “Boy, I’ve got the wrong board. How do I engage differently with the board to get those -”"
29D,29D_17,A,"Back then there would have been eight, yes."
29D,29D_170,Q,-@ discussions?
29D,29D_171,A,Yes.
29D,29D_172,Q,Is that what you did when – your first example – when the board was actually not -
29D,29D_173,A,"Yes. I actually sat down with the chair and said, “We need to get a different board here.” So initially – a board – ultimately, a board gets to the point where they do have to support the CEO, right? It’s either support the CEO or fire the CEO. That’s why appointing the CEO is so bloody important, because once you have, you're stuck with him or her. But one of the things we did do, when we did the merger, we actually inherited its directors, because that’s the way you get it done. But separately, I sat down with the chair and said, “I want a different board.”"
29D,29D_174,Q,"Okay, so the chair was fine. It was the other directors – okay."
29D,29D_175,A,"Yes, and that’s the role. As a CEO you should have a conversation with the chair about what mix of experiences you need. And of course the chair will often push back, because sometimes that’s – “I’d prefer not to have this person because they ask hard questions,” but personally, I always wanted the harder question. I’d far rather be embarrassed in front of the board than in front of a stakeholder because you’ve done something stupid."
29D,29D_176,Q,And is that what you’d say to the board?
29D,29D_177,A,"Yes. And that’s the openness. So for me you’ve got differences of opinions, but remember there are differences of perspectives around [it in general] 00:49:11. And in my experience, the differences added to the richness of decision-making. Ultimately, there are very few boards where you hold a vote. If you’ve ever got to a point where in a board, you’re holding a vote, and there’s three to four, and you carry it on four, you’ve well and truly lost the plot, right?"
29D,29D_178,Q,"So it’s really quite resolved, usually?"
29D,29D_179,A,"Or it’s deferred, where you can then end up resolving it. But you’re right, it eventually gets resolved."
29D,29D_18,Q,"Wow, okay. And do you have any idea, that board now, how many -?"
29D,29D_180,Q,"So out of – you talk to the chair – as a CEO you talk to the chair, try to win the chair over, and then -"
29D,29D_181,A,"And if I, as CEO – and as I say, the acquisition was probably at one point – as a CEO, you know, actually, if you’re able to get close – I would quite often – sorry, on – in the few cases where I could see there were differences of opinions, I would absolutely – I would actually take the agenda item off. I’d say, “No, I actually don’t want a decision today.” Because bringing a board with you is just as important. So if I got to – because what I really valued was actually, “Am I missing something here?” For the three people who don’t see it my way, that’s a gift once again."
29D,29D_182,Q,So then what would you do with that gift?
29D,29D_183,A,"Defer the decision, and then I’d actually engage with those three. Why is it I don’t see it like you do? What am I missing? Let me try and convince you, and if you're still not convinced, I’m going to go away and rethink."
29D,29D_184,Q,Excellent. Okay.
29D,29D_185,A,Because that’s what a board brings.
29D,29D_186,Q,Yes. I’ve never heard it described that way. This is so good. Thank you. Yes.
29D,29D_187,A,And you're crazy if you don’t use it.
29D,29D_188,Q,"Yes, but you see you’re unique – have I interviewed – I think I’ve interviewed one person who’s a CEO and a director. It’s that interaction that you’re really clarifying. I talked about that quite a bit. You’ve talked on a unique way of resolving it. Managing diversity. When identifying potential new members, does your board consider ways to increase diversity? And if so, how do they do that?"
29D,29D_189,A,"Yes, so most boards have got to the point where they’ve said – sorry, boards – there’d be very few boards who’d say, “It’s a good thing if we have all men,” yes? So I think boards have got over that. And of course you've got this nice 30%, at least, that has pushed that. That’s what’s been useful, actually."
29D,29D_19,A,"Well, now, if you look at Incitec Pivot, the CEO’s a woman, so she’s obviously managing director, and there are two other women on the board. That would be three out of seven."
29D,29D_190,Q,As the targets.
29D,29D_191,A,"Yes, and if you show up without 30%  -"
29D,29D_192,Q,-@ it’s embarrassing.
29D,29D_193,A,"It is. Quite rightly. But it’s embarrassing the – so obviously boards do a skills matrix, but actually now the good boards also think about an experience matrix. And if you overlay the belief that actually gender is a useful input into all of that, that’s how you get some diversity now. So boards will seek out – will actually pretty much understand, in terms of the brief, what it is, in terms of diversity of thought they want for the next person. And that will inform who you go and target. The good boards do that."
29D,29D_194,Q,How do you find someone who has this diversity of thought that you're looking for?
29D,29D_195,A,"Well, you’ll do that in the spec. And so your headhunters will go out and find that. Now, I’ve got to say, actually, as a board, on both sides of the fence, gee, boards have had to do a lot of training with the headhunters. Because the headhunters actually have been quite slow to make this change, probably because they’re bloody lazy, right? If you’ve got a bunch of people on your books it’s pretty easy just to serve them up. If you’ve got boards now saying, “No, I want you to go and find other headhunters that need to get off their bum and -”"
29D,29D_196,Q,"- Yes, look outside your current basket."
29D,29D_197,A,"Yes. And that’s where actually the gender thing has been quite useful. Because they haven’t got women. So it’s forced when they go out and have a look. So once again, I see it as – I see it really as an enabler, which once again is why I like the 30%. Because it forces the board to think differently. It forces the headhunters to think differently. And you end up with a different pool of people."
29D,29D_198,Q,"I had an interviewee who said they would not go to a board, work on a board, sit on a board, if it didn’t have at least 30% of women."
29D,29D_199,A,"Yes, well, that’s my criteria now. So I’m a Male Champion of Change. How can I possibly sit on a board – so I’ve said no to a bunch of offers, because I’m not going to join a – how can I possibly join a board – number one, it’s not because I’m a Male Champion of Change."
29D,29D_2,Q,"Sorry, who?"
29D,29D_20,Q,"Yes, that’s good. That’s certainly the – over the 30% target, if – I’m not a great numbers person. That’s more your forte. So that’s good. And then – so that was your first board. And then the next board?"
29D,29D_200,Q,This person wasn’t a Male Champion of Change.
29D,29D_201,A,"It’s because I’m not going to join a board that’s going to blow up my reputation. And if I don’t see a leading indicator, what does that tell me about the board? It’s going to be a whole bunch -"
29D,29D_202,Q,"- That’s what this person said, yes."
29D,29D_203,A,"Yes, it’s a leading indicator for me, the fact that you're going to join a board that doesn’t think differently, that -"
29D,29D_204,Q,-@ is conservative? is – they think all the same.
29D,29D_205,A,"Yes. Gee, that’s a good way to sued, isn’t it? Because you will get sued. Because you will run the company into a cliff."
29D,29D_206,Q,"Beautiful. So you see it as a signal of a quality board versus a non-quality board – speaking as a director looking for positions on a board. So the poor board that does not currently have diversity, how they attract -"
29D,29D_207,A,"- Well, they don’t."
29D,29D_208,Q,Interesting. Survival of the fittest then. They’ll die.
29D,29D_209,A,They will. Because there will be a higher performing company.
29D,29D_21,A,"Yes, so the next board is X, which I sit on now. So that’s a – so Incitec is an $8 billion company by [enterprise V/v] 00:03:05. X is $20 billion. And so it’s two out of six."
29D,29D_210,Q,"So do you feel – this question is interesting – that tensions can arise in the board selection process? For example between on the one hand choosing someone for that collegiate fit – the fitting in with your culture, of [learning whatever] 00:56:50 and avoiding groupthink on boards?"
29D,29D_211,A,"Yes. Once again, going back to that [Helen] 00:56:59, I can remember at PWC, she heads up people and culture. And they had a theme one year of recruiting the oddball. The group really has to value it, otherwise – it’s really interesting, because this is exactly it. As I say, I do a lot of work in the gender space, and if you look at the solutions in the gender space, the one – the majority – sorry, a lot of the stuff that hasn’t worked, it’s all technical solutions, right? So, “I’ll put policy in for this.” “I’ll allow men to take parental leave six months when they have a new baby.” I’ll put that in. No one’s taken it up. Well, actually, the technical is necessary, but it’s not sufficient. The adaptive challenge is to rewire the business so it’s okay for you to go and do that. Yes?"
29D,29D_212,Q,Yes.
29D,29D_213,A,"So you have to value it. And if you value it, of course you’ll look for the odd ball. And in fact you will revel in the fact that they’re going to say stuff that you never would, right? And so – and also, you want a bit of tension around the board. If you don’t have tension, what have you got? So the idea that you just have nice conversations is not a great outcome, is it? You always want to have respectful conversations, but the idea that – well, then you become a rubber stamp, right?"
29D,29D_214,Q,"Yes. I think – you mentioned the values fit. And respect is part of that. So respect is an essential ingredient, and probably trust. Probably trust is important on a board too, yes?"
29D,29D_215,A,Absolutely.
29D,29D_216,Q,"So these are values. And then you’re sort of alluding to a commitment to adaptive change; to the importance of culture; viewing the organisation as open and interacting with broader communities, et cetera. So these images and values are important, or understanding some values are important. So you want that, not cultural fit, not collegiate fit. But you want that, and then -"
29D,29D_217,A,"Yes, but by the way, being honest and respectful – it’s pretty low-bar, right?"
29D,29D_218,Q,"I don’t know, in the corporate sector, sorry! We’ve had the Haynes report. It doesn’t seem <laughs> - I might be speaking out of -"
29D,29D_219,A,"As a CEO, I – the work I’m doing at La Trobe is on cultural equalities. So La Trobe had a strategy – they had some cultural equalities, but the cultural equalities sat really on the wall. And I’ve been working on bringing those cultural equalities to life. Good values though [inaudible] 01:00:41 honest, integrity – shit, if you have to write that as one of your values, what are you doing? God, if you're none of those things, you're not even going to get in the door, are you? Whereas the values are around how you show up. So of course you're going to have a mindset of integrity, honesty – of course. But they need to describe your orientation every day. So back at Incitec, [inaudible] 01:01:17 for everyone, every day. Well, bloody hell, we’re an explosives – we blew things up."
29D,29D_22,Q,Two out of six that are female?
29D,29D_220,A,"So safety’s going to be pretty important. Treat the business as your own. Challenge and improve the status quo. They’re the things, right? So you want people to sign onto those as way of thinking and orientation. But within that you want that to play out differently, right? Because it has to play out differently. So what does “treat the business as your own” mean? Well, it means a whole heap of different things, depending on the context. So in one context, it may mean don’t spend a buck. In another context it might be overspend, because this is a huge competitive advantage."
29D,29D_221,Q,It’ll sell out! <laughs>
29D,29D_222,A,"Yes, so there is – these are tools that you bring to orientate yourself, but the way you play them out needs to be different."
29D,29D_223,Q,"So for the board, what would these tools be?"
29D,29D_224,A,"Well, it’s obviously some of the basics, right? So you don’t get onto a board unless you’re honest. You don’t get onto a board unless you’ve got integrity. You don’t get onto a board unless you respect the confidences within the board. Yes? That’s what gets you on. But actually, the reason why you’ll choose a business I think is because of the business’s values. So that’s kind of what you sign onto."
29D,29D_225,Q,"Okay, so aligning it with a business’s values."
29D,29D_226,A,"Yes, because if you disagree with – what are you doing? So if I look at X they’ve got – if you read X’s value set, in terms of the way they want to run the business, which is honest conversations with customers, that’s – I look at the business, but then I look at its values. So in terms of whether I want to – I start with business, its values, and then I look at whether the board’s any good, right? And you’ve got to sign onto those. And a board needs to take up its role, consistent with those. Because if it’s not, that’s the problem, right? Because ultimately they describe the culture. So if you think about what Haynes found, actually there was – and by the way, you’ve got to go out and seek that – but in banking, which it never addressed, by the way – there is an underlying culture that the bank can win, even if the customer loses. That’s what caused charging dead people, right? Haynes hasn’t addressed that."
29D,29D_227,A,"But that’s what you're signing onto, and that’s what a board truly is trying to seek out when they’re talking about culture. And the question is – because if you look at the banks, they’ve got wonderfully written values -"
29D,29D_228,Q,-@ I know!This is the trouble. yes.
29D,29D_229,A,"Well, they’re on the wall, not lived."
29D,29D_23,A,Yes.
29D,29D_230,Q,I know. They’re like your policy.
29D,29D_231,A,"And so you need to sign onto those. The board needs to reflect that. That’s what setting tone is. The board has to set tone through the language in the business, which should be the values. And then go and bloody test whether that’s actually what happens in the – out there in the business. That’s what a board needs to do. If a board’s not doing that – but you don’t come and try to rewrite the values of the organisation. Most organisations’ values have been driven from the bottom-up. It’s what people truly do. Boy, it’s dangerous if you try to do that."
29D,29D_232,Q,"Yes, so – but the values – all right, that’s great. That’s great. That’s really good. Yes, no, it’s really good. It’s really good. Do the boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity? Are there any barriers to that?"
29D,29D_233,A,"<knock on the door> I think – yes, I’ve got to go."
29D,29D_234,Female,You’ve got an appointment with [Jane and Mallia] 01:05:46.
29D,29D_235,A,"Great. I think it’s always – it’s just embracing this thought, right? The biggest barrier in a lot of boards that I look at is if you’re not careful, boards are about ten years behind. Because a lot of them – sorry, traditional boards – and you can almost pick them out, actually – you can see actually the mindset of the board relates to a period – because a lot of – it’s a lot of ex-executives who end up on boards, right? And particularly these professional directors, you can end up with some mindsets related to -"
29D,29D_236,Q,-@ some baggage.
29D,29D_237,A,"Yes, so it’s that - so I’m not a professional director. I’m choosing to sit on two boards. That’s it. And what I don’t like is when you end up with people who are professional directors. I don’t think they make good directors. Because once again, [what’s the ecosystem] 01:06:55? I hang out at a university and pretend I'm an academic. That’s a different perspective."
29D,29D_238,Q,"Yes, exactly. The last question is just, ten years into the future, how would you like to see diversity of Australian boards?"
29D,29D_239,A,"Far more than just gender, right? So it needs to match the societies and the customer bases in which they operate. So, boy, on Australian boards, what’s the huge gap? How many people from an Asian background are on Australian boards? It’s pretty bloody obviously, isn’t it? So I hope we’ve stopped talking about gender. Boy, we’ve achieved nothing if we haven’t. And I hope they look at lot – and also, I would hope that we’ve broken open this idea that you’ve got to have this background, right? And now I interact with academics, why wouldn’t you bring a couple of academics on board?"
29D,29D_24,Q,Yes. That’s good. And you’ve been on that board since -?
29D,29D_240,Q,I’ll turn this off. Thank you so -
29D,29D_241,A,I’d love to -
29D,29D_25,A,March.
29D,29D_26,Q,"Oh, so that’s recent."
29D,29D_27,A,"Sorry, February."
29D,29D_28,Q,So six months. So the first one you were on for how many years?
29D,29D_29,A,Ten years.
29D,29D_3,A,The company I sit on the board of.
29D,29D_30,Q,That’s a long tenure.
29D,29D_31,A,"No, no, no, 12 – 13 years."
29D,29D_32,Q,Was that typical? Such a long tenure?
29D,29D_33,A,"Well, I was management, so it’s not – so on that board I was finance director initially, and then CEO. So obviously managing director. Obviously the X Group, I’m a non-executive director."
29D,29D_34,Q,"Yes, and this is – you were a director. Okay. Beautiful. Okay. So first, you’ve already mentioned that the composition of boards that you’re familiar with have changed quite remarkably -"
29D,29D_35,A,"- for the better, I would tell you."
29D,29D_36,Q,"- and – for the better? So if you could rate – let’s Say I give you a scale of one to ten – one it’s not important at all, and ten it’s extremely important, where would you rate diversity?"
29D,29D_37,A,Ten.
29D,29D_38,Q,And do you feel that it’s always been important?
29D,29D_39,A,"It should have always been important, because the great gift the board gives an enterprise is difference of view. So I’ve always – certainly running the company, as CEO, I always said, “Look, I’ve got 5,000 people who know a lot about the company.” And you tend to get – no matter how mindful you are of wanting to operate at the strategic level, gee, if something happens in the business, you need to go and address it as CEO. So by definition you’ve got a whole organisation that thinks – tends to think in the same way, although we’re trying to change that. And you're embedded in that. And then you've got this gift of a bunch of people you can work with, in terms of a board, whose role is to think differently. And I always used to think about a board meeting on – I always used to score the board meetings on whether they were good or bad."
29D,29D_4,Q,"How about – X, did you say?"
29D,29D_40,A,"And my reference was, “How many questions were asked that I’ve never asked as a CEO?” And boards have a wonderful ability to step out of the business, and because boards tend to be more broadly networked – because in a business you tend to network within your industry and customer group – boards are the opposite. It’s far broader. Boards have a wonderful ability to triangulate. So they typically can speak to a wider group and figure out, “Is the conversation in the company, does it feel right?” And bring a difference of view. And I think key to bringing a difference of view is diversity – by definition they’re linked, aren’t they?"
29D,29D_41,Q,"Yes, this is – we will explore this. Do you want to do that now? Talk about your understanding? Or -"
29D,29D_42,A,"Yes, so for me, that’s why I think it’s vital. Because, boy, it’s easy to run an enterprise into a cliff. And you want difference of view – number one, to stop believing your bullshit, but secondly because you’re just not going to see stuff that others can. And the hindsight is – the thing about hindsight, it’s obvious when you have fundamental errors in an enterprise, hindsight tells you, “You should have seen them.” I think diversity allows you to see them."
29D,29D_43,Q,"Okay, so can we talk about – when you were a CEO, 14 years ago, was there any -"
29D,29D_44,A,- Three years ago I was CEO. I was on the board for 14 years.
29D,29D_45,Q,Sorry.
29D,29D_46,A,"Yes, three years ago. Anyway, yes."
29D,29D_47,Q,Were you a finance director and then CEO?
29D,29D_48,A,"Yes, so I started – so Incitec Pivot – sorry, it’s a fertiliser and explosives company. So I joined it as CFO, and then was promoted from CFO to CEO, and I was CEO for nine years."
29D,29D_49,Q,"For nine years. So that was nine plus two – 11 years ago, was it?"
29D,29D_5,A,It’s X Group. I’m a director of X Group.
29D,29D_50,A,Yes.
29D,29D_51,Q,So 11 years ago. And then you were sitting on board meetings as CEO?
29D,29D_52,A,"Yes, CEO and managing director. So obviously the director who managed the business."
29D,29D_53,Q,"That’s right, and so you were on the board then. So 11 years ago, during that period, did you find a decision – can you remember a decision or a situation – and we will de-identify – that illustrates this point where the board perhaps either did or didn’t think of something that was not in the operational [mind] 00:09:08, and it turned the business around or whatever?"
29D,29D_54,A,"Well, actually, as it turned out, management did that, and we had a huge pushback from the board. So the business was a fertiliser business. And if you looked at the make-up of a lot of the board they were farmers, fertiliser people. And the story of Incitec was quite an interesting one, because we put the business together initially through the merger of two businesses – one which was called Incitec, one which was called Pivot. So it wasn’t – and actually both of those entities now are 100 years old this year – the antecedent entities. And so the mindset of the board, because it wasn’t diverse, was, “We’re a fertiliser business.” Now, interestingly, we had a [inaudible] 00:10:04 moment when we bought a business from BHP called Southern Cross Fertilisers. Bought it for $100 million. Paid for it in two months. Bought it just as there was a huge boom in fertiliser prices. They went from $200 a tonne to $1,000."
29D,29D_55,A,"And so there was a period of time where our share price would go up by a $1 or $2 a day. We went from a billion to about $11 billion. We were the highest performing stock on the ASX. And there was a huge view that actually this reflected stronger for longer in terms of fertiliser prices. And at the time the world was three months away from running out of food. All to do with the industrialisation, urbanisation of China, changing diets, blah-de-blah-de-blah. And at that point in time, we had a look at the fertiliser business and said, “We don’t believe any of this. In fact, we actually think it’s not the new [norm or] 00:11:22 it will come back.” And also, when we look at our business, we actually don’t like fertiliser industry, because of its volatility, and actually you want it to go global, which we wanted to do – rather than being $10 billion you had to be $80 billion. So we could never get the scale to go global, and even if you went global, we didn’t think the returns were that great."
29D,29D_56,A,"So strategically we made the decision to use that $10 billion share price to diversify the business, and that’s when we bought the explosives business. And the link is modern explosives are fertilisers, right? But, boy, to get the board out of the mindset that we’re an agricultural, fertiliser business, and, “Hey, this is going incredibly well. Look at the share price,” blah-de-blah-de-blah, was an incredibly difficult thing to do. Now, as it turns out, the business we bought was Dyno Nobel, which Alfred Nobel, who invented explosives, it took the business global. And we used that really expensive share-price to buy it. So it was a script based transaction. And if you look today – so at the time, 75% of the earnings were fertiliser. 25% were explosives. And that was the ownership structure. So the Dyno shareholders, who we bought, got 25% of the business. Our shareholders, who were Incitec, got 75%."
29D,29D_57,A,"Look at the earnings today, they’re about 80% explosives, 20% ferts. So that’s a massive amount of shareholder value that was created.  But, boy, we were on the cusp of really struggling to get the board across the line, because they just could not see. Now, if you fast-forward today and look at that board, that would be an incredibly easy -"
29D,29D_58,Q,-@ decision?
29D,29D_59,A,"Yes, because you’ve got far more diversity sitting around the board, of thought and experience."
29D,29D_6,Q,"Yes, what I’ll say for myself is I’ll search for that and replace it with “X”, just in case – you don’t have to – just say “the organisation” -"
29D,29D_60,Q,"So back to that time when there was a barrier, that was when they were mainly farmers -"
29D,29D_61,A,"- Farmers, agricultural."
29D,29D_62,Q,"Their stakeholders were all to do with that farming network, and -"
29D,29D_63,A,"- Yes, they were all men. Farmers tend to be old, So the board was full of a bunch of old men."
29D,29D_64,Q,"Yes, okay, so your classic non-diverse board."
29D,29D_65,A,Yes.
29D,29D_66,Q,"So somehow you persuaded the board to come along with you. When you bought into that bigger company, the ammunitions company, did that automatically put people on the board?"
29D,29D_67,A,"Well, yes, fortunately at the same time we were able to change the diversity – the mix that a board – in terms of skills – and that was when Rebecca McGrath – you may have come across – Rebecca sits on a whole heap of boards – came on board, and that’s where we started to change the mix."
29D,29D_68,Q,So how did you bring her on?
29D,29D_69,A,It just happened to be her experience was oil and gas. And it caused a lot of business globally – fertilisers’ gases are feedstock. So the gift – Rebecca was a huge gift. But she was brought on because of that experience. The other director who sits on the board is Kathryn Fagg now.
29D,29D_7,A,"It’s just that – as you know, as a non-executive director you’ve got no authority to talk on behalf of the company."
29D,29D_70,Q,I haven’t interviewed either of these.
29D,29D_71,A,"Two outstanding women. Absolutely outstanding. And if you look at Rebecca and Kathryn they’re regularly written up as the women in influence around boards. But that was a catalyst to say actually we needed a different looking board. And I guess at the time – so this was 2008. In some respects we haven’t come very far, because we’ve still got less than 30%. But if you look back, we’ve come an enormous – as a community."
29D,29D_72,Q,And they’re not all farmers now?
29D,29D_73,A,No.
29D,29D_74,Q,"Yes, are there any farmers?"
29D,29D_75,A,None.
29D,29D_76,Q,Because you're – what did you say -?
29D,29D_77,A,20%.
29D,29D_78,Q,"- 20% now is fertiliser. And that tends to be Australian focused, not global?"
29D,29D_79,A,"Yes, whereas the business is global as it operates in 13 countries now. So it was your classic taking your Australian business global. So yes, and now if you look around our board, the chair has actually just stepped down. Paul Brasher’s an accounting person, so from Price Waterhouse Coopers. He’s global chairman of that company. There are a couple of engineers on it, because it’s an engineering company – Rebecca, Kathryn – so it’s far more diverse. And of course the CEO now is Jeanne Johns. She’s obviously a female. But I’m a Male Champion of Change."
29D,29D_8,Q,"Oh yes, and we don’t want you to. You're not talking on behalf of the company, you're – so thank you, [29D] 00:00:40, for agreeing to participate in the research. As you’re aware, we’re looking at board diversity. We’re looking at it from the perspective of Australian directors and organisations that influence them. So particularly interested in hearing your perspective on the for-profit sector directors – that experience. We will de-identify the transcript, so that’s good. So can I ask how many years have you been a director of any board, for that matter?"
29D,29D_80,Q,"Oh good, I have interviewed -"
29D,29D_81,A,- So I have -
29D,29D_82,Q,"- Yes, good?"
29D,29D_83,A,"I actually convened the 2015 group. And so I was really chuffed when I was – when Jeanne succeeded me, because that’s what we were trying to do. But, boy, if you look back at the board, having a female CEO that was outside the industry, boy, that would have never happened."
29D,29D_84,Q,"No. Farmers – I get farmer mindset, so yes, that would have been just -"
29D,29D_85,A,"- Yes, and as it turns out, the fertiliser bit went from a billion to $10 billion and it’s probably worth a billion. So if you think about it, that’s a huge amount of value that was created through that transaction."
29D,29D_86,Q,"Absolutely. Look, I’m just going to follow this story because it cuts across a lot of the questions, and it will be richer if we follow the story. Was there any – you’ve got two very different businesses almost, put together. One’s focused on Australia. It’s farming focused. It’s different stakeholders. You’ve got 80% of the business is globally facing. It’s globally – it’s ammunitions. It’s got different stakeholders. It’s got engineering base. But they both -"
29D,29D_87,A,"Yes, it’s industrial explosives, by the way. So it’s shooting coal, iron ore -"
29D,29D_88,Q,"Oh, okay, so it’s not shooting guns. Right."
29D,29D_89,A,"- pipelines, quarries. but you’re right, they’re very different businesses."
29D,29D_9,A,"Yes, so 2005 was the first time I joined a ASX board."
29D,29D_90,Q,"Yes, very different businesses. So you now don’t have anyone on the board representing, let’s say, the interests of the 20% of local farmers. Is this a problem? Is there tension between the two -?"
29D,29D_91,A,"Well, not really, because of course you’ve got a business still, that’s a fertiliser business. So the customer focus is still there. Boards – I’m actually a huge advocate for – not filling boards up with people who know deeply about the business. And that’s just – as I said, there’s 5,000 people in Incitec who know deeply about mining and deeply about fertiliser. Why you’d need to repeat that on the board, I’ve got no idea. And boards spend enough time understanding the business. So it’s not as if you haven’t got anyone on the board who hasn’t got a view of agriculture. Of course they do. Boards interact with customers. Boards don’t just sit there and take what management tells them, passively. Boards spend time with the customer base and seek out that knowledge. And the great confidences – what you're looking for is people around the board who have some customer-centricity."
29D,29D_92,A,"That’s what brings the voice of the customer in. it’s that mindset, rather than, “I used to run a farm 30 years ago.” So it’s almost dangerous actually, because if you end up with directors, by definition a director’s day job is directing. It isn’t farming anymore. So you can end up with quite a dangerous view of a customer base that isn’t, if you're not careful. Whereas an orientation around customer-centricity, which would be, “I’ll seek out and understand what the customer’s requirements are,” is far more valuable, because you get that independent – so I never saw it as an impediment. At the same time we didn’t fill the boar dup with mining people, right?"
29D,29D_93,Q,"Yes, okay. This seems to differ from the not-for-profit service sector. You haven’t had board experience in that area, I gather, but you probably are a bit aware of it, are you? Or -? Because they tend to think differently."
29D,29D_94,A,"Yes, but they’re much more hands-on, right?"
29D,29D_95,Q,"Yes, and their customers are much closer to their – yes. Okay, so this is a really nice contrast. That’s good. So we’ll – that’s good. Diversity is important, even at this level, to recognise -"
29D,29D_96,A,"So you might have one person from – if you have a board of eight, you might – if you look at the X board, you’ve got – our chair, Michael Fraser, well, Michael ran AGL, so he’s got great knowledge of the industry. Sorry, X owns $20 billion of gas pipelines. So we connect, obviously, gas producers with consumers, whether they be our consumers – if you had a shower this morning – are you Victorian?"
29D,29D_97,Q,Yes.
29D,29D_98,A,Have you got a gas hot water service?
29D,29D_99,Q,Yes.
2IN,2IN_1,Q1,Can you see us {participant]?
2IN,2IN_10,A,That's fine.
2IN,2IN_100,Q1,"Yep, that's brilliant. Okay, so, what do you understand, you mentioned it earlier, by cognitive diversity?"
2IN,2IN_101,A,"So, really, it's sort of diversity - I guess it in part it relates to diverse styles of thinking. I found that on a charitable board that I worked as company secretary for, it was very interesting, we had Directors from what you would call traditional board backgrounds, so, finance, accounting, law, and it was a health charity, so we also had people with expertise in the relative area, but we recruited some younger people, and particularly with charities a lot of fundraising is now going online - in fact, I've seen this in two charities, so, digital expertise is particularly valued by this sector because increasingly services and fundraising is going online."
2IN,2IN_102,A,"Typically that's a younger group of people who have that expertise, so it was kind of interesting to see how that worked in the context of just how it changed the dynamic, because you'll have a different way of - coming from that sort of background you will have a very different set of considerations from someone who has, say for example, spent their professional career as an accountant or a lawyer or a finance person."
2IN,2IN_103,Q1,"So, can you describe a situation, like, give us a feel for how that was, like, I can see it's very different, especially if it was a fairly established board and then they brought this new, young person -?"
2IN,2IN_104,A,"Well, for example, they just ask - they ask different questions, they think about different things, they take different things into consideration. They've got a different knowledge base, and apart from anything else, we moved from doing a dozen hard copies of board papers to most people doing it on their laptop or iPad. So, I felt the immediate benefit of not having to prepare 14 sets of hard copy board papers."
2IN,2IN_105,Q1,Yeah. Was it -
2IN,2IN_106,A,As did the planet.
2IN,2IN_107,Q1,"Yeah, exactly. [inaudible] 00:57:54. Was there any communication gap? Did you feel a lack of understanding, a lack of collaboration, a potential conflict?"
2IN,2IN_108,A,"Not in this case, but I guess there could be. I mean, that's not inconceivable, and this wasn't a listed board, it was a charity, so different dynamic again. People are there because they want to give back, so you do have a different dynamic - well, I'm not saying that listed company Directors don't want to give back either, but it is a different dy - and unpaid, so it's a different dynamic."
2IN,2IN_109,Q1,"So, you think that unpaid thing makes a difference?"
2IN,2IN_11,Q2,"So, just to let you know who he is. Over to you, Margo."
2IN,2IN_110,A,"Not to someone who takes the job seriously. It shouldn't. Responsibilities are just the same, the liabilities."
2IN,2IN_111,Q2,Yep.
2IN,2IN_112,Q1,"Do you think pay - because there is a bit in the literature about pay being relevant, and the size of the pay, do you think that's a factor at all, or no?"
2IN,2IN_113,A,"I don't actually track board salaries closely enough to have a really particularly profound understanding. I mean, anecdotally you hear that, given it is likely that, particularly for large financial services entities, Directors are going to have fewer directorships and committees are going to be working quite hard, it is highly likely that the salaries for Directors will increase, but that's just really anecdotal. That's probably something worth teasing out with the search firms."
2IN,2IN_114,Q2,Yes.
2IN,2IN_115,Q1,"Excellent [inaudible] 00:59:41. You've got some great ideas, {the participant], thank you. Cheers."
2IN,2IN_116,A,"Oh, well, they'll have a better feel for it, because they will be in the market at the moment and they'll be seeing trends, so - I don't know whether they still do it, but Korn Ferry used to do a board study. I don't know whether they still do, or Egon Zehnder. They're some of the, they do a lot of the blue-chip recruiting."
2IN,2IN_117,Q1,"Is that E-G-O-N [Zenber] 01:00:08, Z-E-N -"
2IN,2IN_118,A,"E-G-O-N, yeah, Z-E-H-N-D-E-R, and Korn Ferry."
2IN,2IN_119,Q1,"Okay, great.  I'll give them a look and get back to you. Okay, so, now we're up to -"
2IN,2IN_12,Q1,"Great. Thanks, {the participant]. So, we better start, I think. There's a lot of talk about board diversity, but we're interested to hear from you because you represent a governance institute, so your responses to questions may be from that position or a personal, if you want to make a personal comment please feel free [inaudible] 00:33:52 differentiate whether you're speaking with that hat on or your personal hat on, whichever, that's fine. So, let's start by hearing about, what does board diversity mean to you? What do you understand board diversity to mean?"
2IN,2IN_120,Q2,"I'll just step in there with the next question, because I just want to reframe it a little bit given something that you said. I think we agreed cognitive diversity is a good thing, what sort of ways could boards - what's the sort of thing they could do to try and increase cognitive diversity when identifying potential new members?"
2IN,2IN_121,A,"Well, obviously, you’ll need - you need to, it really is good governance to have a skills matrix, so you need to work within what you need according to your skills matrix, but that is possibly something you would tease out during the recruitment process."
2IN,2IN_122,Q2,"Right. So, you've talked about the skills matrix, do you - in your experience are organisations increasingly trying to adopt the same sort of thing with behaviours, so, behavioural matrices if you like?"
2IN,2IN_123,A,"Not that I'm - look, I don't know, I'm not close enough to the board - I haven't been close enough to a board recruitment process for a while, but I would imagine they are, and again, that would be something it might be worth teasing out perhaps with the AICs or with one of the search firms."
2IN,2IN_124,Q2,"Right, okay."
2IN,2IN_125,A,"Watermark is one that we use where we are, but I know that they do quite a bit of board, a reasonable amount of board search in the smaller groups, and probably in the not for profits, so they might be worth - I don't have a name there, but maybe look at whoever does their board search."
2IN,2IN_126,Q1,"Okay. In your experience, {the participant], is educational background, gender, ethnicity, social status, age - are all these kinds of diversity a good predictor of cognitive disability?"
2IN,2IN_127,Q2,Diversity.
2IN,2IN_128,Q1,"Oh, diversity - cognitive disability? I'm a researcher. Cognitive diversity."
2IN,2IN_129,A,"My personal view is probably yes. I don't know if we have an organisational view, and that would disclose my biases, I suppose, if I were to unpack my personal view. But I think people from particular schools, for example, or particular universities, will react to things in similar ways. In fact, one of my kids was being treated in emergency recently, and I could pretty much pick which private school he had gone to just by how he dealt with the situation and the questions he asked, and his approach. But that's, I guess, unpacking my personal biases."
2IN,2IN_13,A,"Okay, so, I see it as being related to not just gender diversity, on which there has obviously been a lot of recent focus, but really also about diversity of perspective, and probably cognitive diversity - and different backgrounds. Not just accountants, lawyers and engineers."
2IN,2IN_130,Q1,"But personal bias, it's a framework, it's how, as a Director of a company, we have that, that's what we have."
2IN,2IN_131,A,"Oh, absolutely. People don't get cleansed on their way into the boardroom, do they?"
2IN,2IN_132,Q1,"Exactly, so, do you think, though, it influences cognitive diversity? Is there a connection between those demographics and cognitive diversity, or you think it's pretty -?"
2IN,2IN_133,A,I reckon that's a fascinating study.
2IN,2IN_134,Q2,"Well, I'll give you a preview, {the participant], you'll recall we talked about the fact that this is a pilot of a working [inaudible] 01:04:18, this is a pilot of the pilot, so there's going to be a big study, but we really see it as the launching pad to something else, and I think - the current thinking, I don't want to [inaudible] 01:04:32 things until it's finished, but I think one area we definitely want to explore is exactly that, and there are potential ways to do it in a fairly hard empirical way as well. So, yeah, that's very much on the front burner, but we'll talk to you [overtalk] 01:04:54."
2IN,2IN_135,A,"Well, I'll have to [overtalk] 01:04:54 - have a look -"
2IN,2IN_136,Q2,"We're digressing a bit from the interview per se, but, yeah."
2IN,2IN_137,A,"Have a look at the, I think it's the 30% Club in the UK?"
2IN,2IN_138,Q2,"Yeah, yeah."
2IN,2IN_139,A,"And there's a woman called Nicola - oh, what is her name? Nicola - oh, she’s the UK Sun Manager with about 19 children who does - she came out for AICD a few years ago, but she was very impressive, and she talks quite a lot about cognitive diversity."
2IN,2IN_14,Q1,"So, cultural -"
2IN,2IN_140,Q1,"Okay, good. From your perspective, {the participant], do you think that the relative importance of the different kinds of diversity that [inaudible] 01:05:36 depend on the company's situation and strategy, and could -?"
2IN,2IN_141,A,"Well, that would definitely be relevant, because it's going to depend what business you're in as to what you need."
2IN,2IN_142,Q1,"If that's the case, can I just [inaudible] 01:05:55, if that's the case, then -"
2IN,2IN_143,A,"It won't be conclusive, but it's certainly, I would - from my perspective I reckon it has to be part of the mix, and I think that really - sorry, I've lost my train of thought. What was I saying? It's part of the mix, and really, when you're thinking about putting a board together, yeah, that's going to have to be important."
2IN,2IN_144,Q1,"Yeah, [inaudible] 01:06:26."
2IN,2IN_145,A,Consciously or unconsciously.
2IN,2IN_146,Q1,"So, the over-boarding phenomena, though, is that intention with this - have we lost you {the participant]? Are you there?"
2IN,2IN_147,A,"No, you're here."
2IN,2IN_148,Q2,[inaudible] 01:06:43.
2IN,2IN_149,Q1,"Okay. You know, the over-boarding, so, the same people on multiple boards, is that intention, with the idea that the people you need depend on a situation of the board - of the organisation? Its strategy and situation?"
2IN,2IN_15,A,Or CEO's.
2IN,2IN_150,A,Actually -
2IN,2IN_151,Q1,Or do they all have the same needs?
2IN,2IN_152,A,"Have a look at KPMG - yeah, just put in over-boarding into Google and have a look, there's some stuff that comes up, KPMG did something on it. There's some stuff coming out of Norton Rose Fulbright, certainly it's an issue for some of the property advisors, this is in the listed space, Director over-boarding is commonly deliberated and focused on, so, yeah, there's quite a bit on over-boarding in the listed space."
2IN,2IN_153,Q1,"I guess I was coming - I was trying to see whether, because I remember going to a Women on Boards function, and Penny Wong was saying she was presented with the same names over and over again, and she's [overtalk] 01:07:56 -"
2IN,2IN_154,A,"Yeah, absolutely."
2IN,2IN_155,Q1,"- younger people, and I was thinking, well, if there is - if the construction of the board is to be flexible depending on the company's situation and whatever, you'd think that that would naturally flow to wanting different kinds of people, and not the same group?"
2IN,2IN_156,A,"Well, I think that's part of the problem, and it's traditionally been the problem in Australia, I think. It's a relatively small pool compared to the rest of the world, but we do have quite a lot of listed companies, for example, relative to our size."
2IN,2IN_157,Q1,Okay.
2IN,2IN_158,A,"There's a long skinny tail, it's like a tadpole. There are about 2,200 listed companies, most of the market cap is up the top, so there's this very long, skinny, skinny tail of quite small companies, but a lot of them for our size."
2IN,2IN_159,Q1,"Okay. So, it's most of - so, it's a demographic phenomenon rather than a political one?"
2IN,2IN_16,Q1,"So, cultural backgrounds?"
2IN,2IN_160,A,"Oh, it's probably a mix of things, I think, but certainly, look, I think it's human behaviour, and if you've done any reading around, or done any looking at the people, the males, who are on boards, you will see that for many years the critique has been that it's just the same-old, same-old. And I think the girls club exists just as much as the boys club."
2IN,2IN_161,Q1,"So, how do you think we can break through that?"
2IN,2IN_162,A,"Well, I think you've got to be aware. You've got to raise the profile of the issue, and I'll send you both, I got it this morning - Margo, here we go, and it's Paul, isn't it? I've got a lot of Paul's. I'll just send it to you, Margo, it's just a [Kellogg] 01:10:16 thing that I got this morning, and it talks about, it's about the US, but how to make inclusivity more than just an office buzzword. It's quite interesting, just about some of the things you might want to think about doing."
2IN,2IN_163,Q1,"Good, that's great, because that brings us to, does your organisation do anything to cultivate board members? Well, we've already talked about that, [inaudible] 01:10:46 and networking. Is there anything apart from that?"
2IN,2IN_164,A,"Well, we certainly probably are going to do a bit more this year. We're running a Women in Governance lunch, which we haven't done for a while, so it's an issue that we do think about, although we probably haven't done anything incredibly actively in the last year or so. But certainly, through promoting good governance and through our good governance guides, membership of the ASX Corporate Governance Council, it is an issue for us and it's something we're conscious of."
2IN,2IN_165,Q1,"So, what is the promoting Women in Governance lunch, what's the - could you explain what that is or how it would work?"
2IN,2IN_166,A,"Oh, it's just a lunch we're doing this year looking at women particularly in - one of our themes this year is people, so it's looking at a lunch for women who work in organisations that are focused on people. So, it's just a lunch that were going to do, I think it's in March this year."
2IN,2IN_167,Q1,"Okay. So, build that soft skill capacity in the female -?"
2IN,2IN_168,A,"And obviously through our Effective Director course, that's something we do. That's obviously a component in terms of just building the overall soft skill profile."
2IN,2IN_169,Q1,"Okay. Do you offer any coaching, or -?"
2IN,2IN_17,A,Yes.
2IN,2IN_170,A,"I'm not - there was a proposal a while ago, but I don't know what's happened to that, but I think - we have a new CEO, and she was actually, funnily enough, talking about that the other day."
2IN,2IN_171,Q1,"Okay. Watch this space, then, yeah?"
2IN,2IN_172,A,Yeah.
2IN,2IN_173,Q1,"More generally, how do you think diversity should be increased in Australian company boards?"
2IN,2IN_174,A,"Well, there's certainly been some industry initiatives, so, AICD has their initiative, and it will be interesting to see when the new addition of the ASX principles comes out what it has to say on the issue particularly of gender diversity. I think it's a whole range of things. I mean, then there's the great discussion about should there or shouldn't there be a quota. The Norwegian solution."
2IN,2IN_175,Q1,What do you think about that?
2IN,2IN_176,A,"Look - yeah, I don't know. Part of me thinks it would be interesting to have a go, and, I mean, I'm sure you're aware of the fact that public sector boards are doing much better than private sector."
2IN,2IN_177,Q2,Yeah.
2IN,2IN_178,Q1,Yes. Interesting. Why do you think that's the case?
2IN,2IN_179,A,"I think it's probably been very much strategy. There are so many women in the public service. There's much more equal opportunity of all types, it's just more widely embraced, I think, in the public sector."
2IN,2IN_18,Q1,"Socio-economic, this sort of thing."
2IN,2IN_180,Q1,"Do you think the culture behind the not for profits, the broader culture, whether its church based or whatever, might influence the board selection?"
2IN,2IN_181,A,"I think that's going to depend on the sector, because, particularly if you think about the not for profit space you will get - it's often seen as a great place for women to get a start on boards. So, I think - yeah, the diversity, I'm just thinking of the boards I've got experience with, the diversity was actually pretty good. It was kind of 30 to 40%."
2IN,2IN_182,Q1,Gender diversity?
2IN,2IN_183,A,"Yeah, gender diversity, certainly."
2IN,2IN_184,Q1,"Yeah. What about ethnic, religious - was that as diverse, or was it just gender?"
2IN,2IN_185,A,"I haven't worked with boards that had a particular religious bent. I know certainly in some not for profits you have to be of a particular religious bent just to be involved, just because of the services you're delivering and to which sector. Certainly, one board I was involved with were quite keen, you know, were trying to recruit someone with an indigenous background. In fact, a couple of boards I've worked with have been quite - just because they were, you know, involved in a lot of service delivery to indigenous community, so they were certainly very keen to get that background on the board. On two boards, actually."
2IN,2IN_186,Q1,And did they manage to do that?
2IN,2IN_187,A,"I left one of the - I've left both of those roles whilst they were still in the process of doing it. At different points in time, but, yeah."
2IN,2IN_188,Q1,"Right. Do you think there are barriers to that kind of thing, to -?"
2IN,2IN_189,A,"I think - I'm just trying to remember, I think there was a - I think the pool of candidates, and this was a few years ago, so I suspect the pool, as in most other areas, has expanded, but it was finding people from an indigenous background with the right skill set, and that's probably a demographic issue as much as anything else."
2IN,2IN_19,A,Yeah.
2IN,2IN_190,Q1,Yeah. Is that something that your organisation could have a scholarship for? Would that be something they would see as within their -?
2IN,2IN_191,A,"Yeah, look, that's actually, it's a good question."
2IN,2IN_192,Q1,"What would be the barrier to doing that? Just thinking about it, or would it be other reasons that you couldn't?"
2IN,2IN_193,A,"I - it's just thinking about it, I think."
2IN,2IN_194,Q1,"Yeah, okay. So, how do strategies such as gender targets influence Australian boards? You mentioned them earlier."
2IN,2IN_195,A,"Sorry, I can't hear you."
2IN,2IN_196,Q1,How do coercive strategies such as gender targets influence Australian boards? You alluded to it.
2IN,2IN_197,A,"I know that there are a couple of camps on that in this debate, and they have pretty strong views. So, it's going to kind of depend which camp you're in."
2IN,2IN_198,Q2,"So, does the governance [institute] 01:17:55 have a particular [public position] 01:17:58 on this?"
2IN,2IN_199,A,"On [quotas] 01:18:01, I'd have to look, because it would have been come up with before my time."
2IN,2IN_2,A,Sorry?
2IN,2IN_20,Q1,And what about networks.
2IN,2IN_200,Q2,"Right. So, I think there's a difference between the targets and a quota. A target is kind of, the way I interpret it is a more aspirational thing."
2IN,2IN_201,A,[inaudible] 01:18:18.
2IN,2IN_202,Q2,"[But a quota] 01:18:18, as in that some of the public sector, it's, you don't have an option, yeah? It is going to be 20% or 30% or whatever."
2IN,2IN_203,A,Yeah.
2IN,2IN_204,Q2,"I'm possibly oversimplifying a bit, but -"
2IN,2IN_205,A,Yeah.
2IN,2IN_206,Q2,The other thing -
2IN,2IN_207,A,"And it would be interesting, I mean, I worked many years ago for the AICD, and I think the more traditional Director was very much opposed to targets. It would be interesting to see whether there's been a -"
2IN,2IN_208,Q2,Shift.
2IN,2IN_209,A,"Or, you know, targets and legislation, it would be interesting to see whether there's been a shift in their membership over time."
2IN,2IN_21,A,"Yes, I think that's quite an interesting one, because, and I can't remember where I saw it, but the phenomenon you've had - actually, it was interesting, it was [inaudible] 00:35:28, one of the [inaudible] 00:35:29 articles recently [inaudible] 00:35:33, talked about the fact that whilst we know about the traditional pale, male, stale networks, similar networks exist amongst the women who have been appointed to boards, and this article I was reading, [inaudible] 00:35:58 it was in one of [inaudible] 00:35:59, talked about the fact that although the increase in the US had not been as marked as might have been hoped, they were starting to see a much broader pool of women on boards, because being considered to be one of the sound group of women that you might aspire to have on your board can be as much a phenomenon as exists for men, there are just fewer of them. Does that make sense?"
2IN,2IN_210,Q2,Right.
2IN,2IN_211,A,"But they, similarly, would probably have some pretty firmly entrenched views in opposing camps."
2IN,2IN_212,Q2,"Right. Just a related question, how do you think - let's just say with gender, how do you think, say, women -"
2IN,2IN_213,A,"It's interesting that people talk about gender, because in fact I was having, I can't remember where the discussion was, but we were talking about this recently - oh, I know, it was when we were discussing the draft of the ASX principles, and I think one of the company secretaries was saying, gender's easy, because it's easy to measure and it doesn't stir up any sensibilities, or too many sensibilities, so it's an easy one to report against."
2IN,2IN_214,Q2,"Right, but let's say with gender, so, we've brought in targets or quotas which are where we want to go, how do you think existing board members who are women may feel about that? [inaudible] 01:20:05 existing -"
2IN,2IN_215,A,"I think there are some that think it's a great idea, and I suspect, depending on sector, that there are some that are all for it, and there are some who would say it was a terrible idea, and there are probably some in the middle."
2IN,2IN_216,Q2,And what [inaudible] 01:20:22 -
2IN,2IN_217,A,"Which is not a very helpful answer from your perspective, but I think that's probably about what the position is."
2IN,2IN_218,Q2,"Right, but do you get a sense of why they would think it's a terrible idea?"
2IN,2IN_219,A,"Oh, because they think that the board should have unfettered discretion to select the most appropriate board for the company."
2IN,2IN_22,Q2,Yep.
2IN,2IN_220,Q2,Yeah. I've also [overtalk] 01:20:47 -
2IN,2IN_221,A,"So, they've just got to go with the best candidate for the job, who may not be female, and, I mean, there are many jokes about the fact that the traditional Directors would say, ""Well, we advertised, but there was no woman with the skill set. We couldn't find a suitable woman who had the skill set we needed."""
2IN,2IN_222,Q1,"There is a major barrier recognised in the literature, experience as a CEO is often seen as very important, and there have historically been hurdles to women getting to a CEO position."
2IN,2IN_223,A,"Have a look at that article I've just sent you from the [Kellogg] thing, because it actually talks about that, and I think it's sort of saying that you need to be looking broader than ex-CEO's, and the point the writer of the article was making is that there are plenty of men who are not former CEO's on boards, but that the bar is higher for women. So, -that - and this is talking about the US, but it would be interesting to see whether that was the same in Australia, because there are fewer CEO's, you know, it's fact, there are fewer female CEO's."
2IN,2IN_224,Q1,"So, does your organisation have anything to try and - does it see it as a mission to try and amend this, to address this lack? You know, help women and other people, like people from Aboriginal backgrounds, move up into a CEO -?"
2IN,2IN_225,A,"We don't have anything specific at the moment, but that doesn't mean we won't, and that we aren't supportive of diversity. Company secretaries are pretty diverse. It's interesting."
2IN,2IN_226,Q1,What's the proportion of - what's the gender split in that?
2IN,2IN_227,A,"I'd have to have a look, but if you look at our retired members, they're all called John and Ian, or Peter."
2IN,2IN_228,Q1,"Oh, well, that tells me something."
2IN,2IN_229,A,"Yes, whereas if you look at the membership it's becoming much more diverse in gender terms, and certainly, I taught the Grad. Dip. for about nine years, and the proportion was often 60/40 women to men, and sometimes higher. So, in terms of people coming through, getting the company secretary qualification, lots of women, and there are a lot of women who are company secretaries of very significant listed companies. I can think of our legislation review committee, you know, we've got most of the top 20 company secretaries, there are men, but there are a lot of very senior women. I mean, BHP's company secretary is a woman, the company secretary just gone and incoming at Comm Bank, for example, is a woman. So, there are a lot of senior female company secretaries in very big companies."
2IN,2IN_23,Q1,"Okay, yeah. So, can you give an example? Have you seen this happen?"
2IN,2IN_230,Q1,"What's the change there, do you think? What explains that demographic change?"
2IN,2IN_231,A,Just anecdotally -
2IN,2IN_232,Q1,[inaudible] 01:24:09.
2IN,2IN_233,A,"- I suppose a lot of them have legal backgrounds, so that's partly because in law and accounting particularly you're getting well over equal, if not slightly more, women going through and getting qualifications. So, whereas my mother knew all the people who did the law course with her, and there was a handful, they could count them on one hand, there were lots of women when I went through, which was a while ago, whereas now, as I said, you know, it might be 55/45. So, I think it's really just the opening up, particularly in the more traditional professions, to women, and I guess a lot of women might see it as a more palatable way of achieving a really interesting career, than being a partner in a major law firm of a major accounting firm. Not that there aren't a reasonable number of those as well. And it's an interesting job."
2IN,2IN_234,Q1,"Yeah. Well, {the participant], that's really great. I've really learned a lot from what you've been saying, and I'll look at those documents."
2IN,2IN_235,A,"Oh, good."
2IN,2IN_236,Q1,"You've given us some threads to follow, different people to interview, which is very useful, but before we go is there anything, any other thoughts you'd like to share on board diversity and how your organisation should manage it now, has in the past, and might into the future."
2IN,2IN_237,A,"Yeah, look, I think it is an issue that's going to come up again. I think everyone was quite exercised about gender diversity, say, five to 10 years ago, and it's gone off the boil a bit, but I think, and I suspect the trend is the same in Australia as it is in that article I sent you about the US, I think the pool is probably now broader. So, even though the overall number of Directors may not have increased as much as had been hoped, I think the pool is probably larger, and certainly we've seen, in the public sector there's been some incredible strides, and I don't know who tracks diversity on not for profit boards, I suppose because the sector's quite diverse, but I would imagine it's pretty good in the not for profit space."
2IN,2IN_238,Q1,"Gender, yeah."
2IN,2IN_239,A,"Have a look at, though, Women on Boards I'm pretty sure do - yeah, I'm sure they do, because in fact I've used it as a teaching aid. Have a poke around on their website, because they've got some quite good charts in terms of diversity in which particular sectors. Let me have a look, I haven't looked at it for a while, but as I said, have a poke around their website because they've got some interesting stuff, and breakdowns of percentages and stuff, and you can have a look at sectors."
2IN,2IN_24,A,"I haven't looked at the stats or, I can't remember who does it, but every so often someone looks at the phenomenon of what they call over-boarding, with which you would be familiar, but, yeah, I think some people do some breakdowns of how many boards particular Directors have in their portfolio. We may actually see, I think, also, given some of the stuff that we were seeing in relation to last year, we may see the pool spreading a little more widely just because I think there is going to be more - board committees, I think, are going to be working harder, particularly in large financial services entities. Because if they are not going to have, perhaps, the same capacity to take on board appointments, there may be fewer companies in particular Director's portfolios just because of the increase in workload."
2IN,2IN_240,Q1,"That's right, yeah, and it shows a rapid increase, like, there's been a marked increase, to the point where we've moved beyond gender now."
2IN,2IN_241,A,"Yeah, and I think that that's kind of the next frontier of diversity, really."
2IN,2IN_242,Q2,Yeah.
2IN,2IN_243,Q1,"Yep, that's right. So, fantastic, thank you so much {the participant]."
2IN,2IN_244,Q2,Thank you very much for that {the participant].
2IN,2IN_245,A,"My pleasure. Come back if you've got any more questions, and, yeah, thank you very much, that was good."
2IN,2IN_246,Q2,Okay.
2IN,2IN_247,Q1,Great.
2IN,2IN_248,Q2,Thanks {the participant].
2IN,2IN_249,Q1,Okay. Enjoy your weekend.
2IN,2IN_25,Q1,"Right, okay, so that's its general dynamic. Well, that's good. That's good. The next question is, do you think the diversity of Australian boards is important?"
2IN,2IN_250,A,"Pleasure. Thank you, bye-bye."
2IN,2IN_251,Q1,Bye-bye.
2IN,2IN_252,Q2,Bye. Do you want to stop the recording?
2IN,2IN_26,A,I think diversity on boards in every country is important.
2IN,2IN_27,Q1,Why is that?
2IN,2IN_28,A,Because I think it's quite clear from a number of studies that diverse groups make better decisions.
2IN,2IN_29,Q1,And better decision - how do you understand that? What makes a better decision?
2IN,2IN_3,Q1,Can you see us?
2IN,2IN_30,A,"I suppose it's really the best decision for the particular entity, but you're bringing, I guess, a broader perspective to your decision making, and particularly given that companies do have to think about a lot of factors when making decisions. We've seen the resurrection of the shareholder privacy debate in the last few months, you know, and they do need to take into account a broad range of stakeholders.  I think that, yeah, diversity is going to be a very important part of that because different backgrounds will have different skills and different knowledge, different networks, so that's going to be important."
2IN,2IN_31,A,"I think the other thing is, too, with change, say, for example, in relation to - you know, technology is rapidly changing, those skills are still not rare, but there are fewer Directors with those skills than, for example, there are with financial skills or general business skills, or legal skills or accounting skills. So, diversity is going to be important in getting the sorts of people that you need on boards that have skills that will take them into the future."
2IN,2IN_32,Q1,"Okay, so, this is really interesting, because I see you putting diversity in a much broader context, a broader social, political context. So, the financial situation here in Australia, the technological trends, global trends, globalisation, are these all factors, do you think, that impact on or shape the importance that diversity has for Australian boards?"
2IN,2IN_33,A,"I think they do, because, particularly as Australian companies look to go elsewhere and to compete in a globalised market, they need to understand what their role is and to have access to the sorts of knowledge and skills they need."
2IN,2IN_34,Q1,"Good. I think you've opened that up really nicely for us, {the participant], thanks very much. The third question, if you're happy - is there any other comment you'd like to make?"
2IN,2IN_35,A,No.
2IN,2IN_36,Q1,"Yep, that's good. Do you feel that more diversity can negatively impact the board's decision making and performance, and if so, how might that happen?"
2IN,2IN_37,A,"I could see that if you had - if you had a poor dynamic amongst the individuals, an extremely diverse board could degenerate to a group of disconnected people who are not capable of making a decision."
2IN,2IN_38,Q1,Okay.
2IN,2IN_39,A,"So, I think the other thing to be aware of when you're thinking about your board composition is, you're also recruiting for soft skills, so you're recruiting for the ability to work with people, to be respectful, to work as a team. So, it's both an art - it's a bit of an art as well, I guess, getting your board composition right."
2IN,2IN_4,A,"I can see you periodically, so it switches between the screen and my [inaudible] 00:32:15 and my phone number."
2IN,2IN_40,Q2,"We've got some questions on selection, et cetera, and we could probably pick some of that up shortly."
2IN,2IN_41,A,"Sure, that's fine."
2IN,2IN_42,Q1,"Yeah. I was thinking of, other feedback has been around the role of the Chair, do you think the Chair is really important in this? In the -"
2IN,2IN_43,A,"The Chair plays a critical role. The Chair makes or breaks a board, really. If you have a good Chair with the right skills, both personal and professional, then you're going to get a team that's going to work much better, and who will be able to bring out the diverse perspectives around the board table, but also get everybody working towards a common aim. I guess it's like, you know, a good captain of any team, really."
2IN,2IN_44,Q1,"Yep. That's great. Okay, so now we'll move on, as Paul flagged, to process. Does your organisation seek to influence the composition of Australian boards with particular respect to diversity?"
2IN,2IN_45,A,"Certainly we've done quite a bit of work, not so much recently, but certainly when the ASX principles focused more heavily on diversity some years ago we did some work on diversity, I think, in association with Women on Boards. But, yeah, obviously diversity is of interest to us."
2IN,2IN_46,Q2,"So, {the participant], when you said you did some work on that, was it more some applied research, or was it an attempt to -?"
2IN,2IN_47,A,We put out some guidance in relation to compliance with principle three.
2IN,2IN_48,Q2,"Gotcha, right, and this was disseminated to your members?"
2IN,2IN_49,A,"Yes, absolutely, and obviously it's also furthering the debate around diversity."
2IN,2IN_5,Q2,"Right, excellent."
2IN,2IN_50,Q2,"Yep, okay."
2IN,2IN_51,Q1,I looked on your website and I noticed there's a lot of education and training that your organisation -
2IN,2IN_52,A,"That we do, yes."
2IN,2IN_53,Q1,"So, has that been picked up in your education program?"
2IN,2IN_54,A,"Yes, it would have been in our Graduate Diploma of Applied Corporate Governance, and it would also be covered in some of the relevant professional development and short course certificates that we do."
2IN,2IN_55,Q1,"Okay. Do you evaluate the outcomes of those training modules in terms of practical outcomes? Perhaps, like -"
2IN,2IN_56,A,I'm not sure what you mean by that.
2IN,2IN_57,Q1,"Would you - an impact, a possible impact of your Graduate Certificate might be that the new board member is better equipped in the soft skills to manage diversity on the board, manage different points of view?"
2IN,2IN_58,A,"Yes, it could well be, and I guess, that's an interesting one to perhaps plug into. We've got a relatively new Effective Director course that actually looks at soft skills and how you work with the dynamics on a board, that actually might be quite an interesting thing to put into that."
2IN,2IN_59,Q1,"Right, okay. Good."
2IN,2IN_6,Q1,That's all right.
2IN,2IN_60,Q2,"And as an aside, potentially, [inaudible] 00:46:17 this, but it's like, if you can - if they're members and they're willing to do it, try and get some feedback over a longer time horizon as well."
2IN,2IN_61,A,Okay.
2IN,2IN_62,Q2,Just a thought.
2IN,2IN_63,Q1,A 360 would be good from the rest of the board. Culture management. Anyway -
2IN,2IN_64,A,Absolutely.
2IN,2IN_65,Q1,"So, can you think of any ways that your organisation helps candidates from minority groups?"
2IN,2IN_66,A,"Well, education is obviously a big part of that, because we provide professional training. So, that's obviously, that's one quite obvious thing we do, and that's open to everybody. We don't have any specific scholarship programs for people from - oh, actually, we do. We have the [Chant] 00:47:09 Legacy Scholarship, so, two candidates per year from a whole - often from quite diverse backgrounds and not for profits, and I think we had someone from overseas last year was one of the winners, so it's the C-H-A-N-T Legacy. So, that's one thing we do in terms of giving people access to our training courses, but at the moment we don't have any particular specific programs in relation to giving people access. I assume you're talking to AICD, aren't you?"
2IN,2IN_67,Q1,Pardon? Your -?
2IN,2IN_68,A,The Australian Institute of Company Directors.
2IN,2IN_69,Q1,"Yes, yeah. Yes, that's what I was looking at, yep. So, is it an expensive - are they expensive courses, like, would it be prohibitive for someone who perhaps wasn't a [CEE] 00:47:56 or wasn't an executive to pay for your courses?"
2IN,2IN_7,Q2,"So, , Happy New Year to you, and thank you very much for joining us, but also, thanks very much, before we start, for organising Kevin for us, that's great."
2IN,2IN_70,A,"We're cheaper than the AICD, but they have, I think they have a reasonable number of scholarship programs, and we do, as I said, we award a couple of scholarships per annum."
2IN,2IN_71,Q1,"That's good. What was the reason for offering one overseas, to an overseas person?"
2IN,2IN_72,A,"I think - well, people apply, so I think that they were a candidate, they applied for the scholarship."
2IN,2IN_73,Q1,Okay. Did they want to come to Australia to be on Australian - is this part of facilitating diversity?
2IN,2IN_74,A,"I can't - it wouldn't necessarily have been, but I remember at the time going, oh, yeah, that's rather nice. Let me just have a look, I'll see if I can find it. I can't find it easily, but, yeah -"
2IN,2IN_75,Q1,"That's good. So, now we're looking at selection processes. How do you think new board members should be selected? [inaudible] 00:49:11."
2IN,2IN_76,A,"It depends on the organisation, but you do need to have a proper process."
2IN,2IN_77,Q1,"So, you say it depends on the organisation, what are the factors there that -?"
2IN,2IN_78,A,"Well, it will depend on what you're required to do under your constitution, so, you know, if we're talking about a listed company or we're talking about a not for profit, or a government board, there will be variations depending on the type of entity, and what you do with a large listed company might be completely different to what you would do for a company limited by guarantee that's a charity, but similar considerations apply. You would need to look at the mix of skills that you currently have, you would need to look at what you're seeking to achieve, and then, say for example in the case of a not for profit, you might answer to –"
2IN,2IN_79,A,"I've worked for various not for profits, so in some cases it's a matter of contacting the membership and letting them know that positions are available, or in other cases you might advertise, and depending on budget you might use a search firm or you might use a combination of approaches. Typically, obviously, in a large listed company you will have a nomination committee, so they will be very much across that process, but you might, in a much smaller entity, have a small committee of the board who work to look at a suitable candidate."
2IN,2IN_8,A,"Oh, pleasure."
2IN,2IN_80,Q1,"Okay, there's two things there that link to some literature for me. One is the nomination [inaudible] 00:50:59, that - how -"
2IN,2IN_81,A,Nomination committee?
2IN,2IN_82,Q1,"Committee, yeah, that's building on the networks that are already within the board, yes? Is that right?"
2IN,2IN_83,A,"In part. Oh, well, you would have a - you set up a committee of the board which is called the nominations committee, and that's usually looking at Director selection, appointment and evaluation."
2IN,2IN_84,Q1,"So, it won't be necessarily people they know, it will be - they might oversee the process with the organising -?"
2IN,2IN_85,A,"They might appoint - they might actually appoint an external consultant to head hunt, and there are a number of consultancies that, at various ends of the market and at various price points, who do board search."
2IN,2IN_86,Q1,Okay.
2IN,2IN_87,A,"I mean, it ranges from, for example, people like Egon Zehnder or Korn Ferry who do the top end of the market, down to putting an ad, you know, running a notice in your association newsletter, or emailing all your members. I mean, we have, particularly not for profits and smaller, we have a job board, as it were, so they use - which is complimentary for not for profit, so they use, people sometimes use that to advertise Director vacancies."
2IN,2IN_88,Q1,"Right. Do people advertise through your organisation's network - like, newsletters or communications?"
2IN,2IN_89,A,"We have a particular, yeah, we have career opportunities, so yeah, we do. Not at the big end, but certainly - oh, in terms of company secretaries, we get the range, because -  and I know all the big - we all look at the career opportunities, everybody, even top 20 company secretaries will go, oh, I see blah, blah is looking for a job, and if you want someone to do that sort of work, we're the best place to go, but we do get a reasonable number of organisations, smaller organisations, who are looking for Directors for not for profits, and they use us, because it's free and it might be one of a range of groups that you apply with, that you put the opportunity out with. Women on Boards have quite a big number of - they advertise a lot of vacancies particularly for women."
2IN,2IN_9,Q2,"Now, Margo is - because Margo will be doing all, [both] 00:32:39 of the interviews, will be the constant across the board, Margo will be the one actually asking the questions, although I may jump in from time to time. Just by introduction, we've obviously met, Margo is [inaudible] 00:32:55 here, and this [handsome young dude] 00:32:56 here is, {the participant], [inaudible] 00:32:59 was also part of the project and he's a data analytics person who will actually be doing some of the analysis of the data, and just wanted to sit in on a couple of meetings to gauge a few things that will help him with how he sets up his analysis, so, he's unlikely to participate in terms of asking questions."
2IN,2IN_90,Q1,But you don't have a particular bias in who you put forward?
2IN,2IN_91,A,"No, not particularly. I mean, I suppose our particular bias would be company secretaries and governance professionals, but we are getting more non-executive Directors, particularly in the not for profit space."
2IN,2IN_92,Q1,"Okay. So, it's quite an influential network that you have in terms of selection of boards, board selection in Australia? [International] 00:54:16, yeah?"
2IN,2IN_93,A,"It might be worth - one of the search firms as well, have you got some, a couple of interviews in that area lined up?"
2IN,2IN_94,Q2,"No, we haven't actually. That's a very good thought, because they are quite - I mean, I was once on a selection committee and we used a search firm, and they're obviously quite influential because they bring you the pool of - they [inaudible] 00:54:48 and they bring you the pool and you select from that. That's a very good idea, {the participant]."
2IN,2IN_95,Q1,"Yeah, an important [filter] 00:54:54."
2IN,2IN_96,A,And maybe look at a couple of different sectors.
2IN,2IN_97,Q2,Right.
2IN,2IN_98,A,"Like, you know, talk to a couple of the big ones, talk to some of the big ones who do the big companies, and then look at people who do smaller and other areas. Then, of course, the whole government board selection process is another game altogether."
2IN,2IN_99,Q2,"Right. No, thanks for that, yeah, we'll pick that up."
30D,30D_1,Q,"Okay, so [30D] 00:00:02, we’ll just get a few demographics initially.  What’s your discipline background?"
30D,30D_10,A,"Well, one is the CPA Centre of Excellence which is really multiple [inaudible] 00:01:07 - it’s a Centre of Excellence for the CPA.  There is a [mortgage finance] 00:01:17 association of Australia which is a [inaudible] 00:01:18 company and then -"
30D,30D_100,A,"[Margot], I think it was even a little bit more basic than the purpose of the board.  It was just honest, open, good behaviour to be honest.  It wasn’t overly cerebral to be perfectly frank.  “You are wanting to further your ambition in a particular way and it’s appropriate to be trying to do it in this setting and in the manner you’re going about it so on both counts, we know about what you’re wanting to do and we do not condone either of them.”"
30D,30D_101,Q,"We’re drilling down on collegiate mindset and how - other people have talked about the board - instead of talking about diversity as a noun, they talk about the board’s ability to include diversity, different perspectives, different whatever and that the board culture is about including voices, working with difference productively and I’m wondering how that connects with your idea of collegiate mindset."
30D,30D_102,A,"Well, the collegiate mindset, it can thrive only if you create an appropriate setting in the board.  So, for example, you need to be what I would call ‘generous’ in your spirits.  So, you need to listen to people and genuinely listen to their points of view.  If they say something, it is a reality for them.  You may disagree with it but it is what they feel and therefore, that alone has a validity so consequently, the environment where you can engender discussion, open discussion without fear of, “I’m too silly to ask this,” or, “I shouldn’t ask it because somebody else may dislike what I’m asking.”"
30D,30D_103,A,"You need to foster an environment where those issues are very clearly stated.  “Ask whatever you want to ask and voice your concerns openly,” and it is the role of the chairman actually, or chairwoman, to foster this kind of spirit of collegiality because invariably in any group of people, you will have people who are more vociferous than others, and therefore, their views will dominate the discussion and it’s important for the chair to say, “Okay, we haven’t heard from you, Jill,” or, “You, Jack,” and say, “What’s your view?”"
30D,30D_104,A,"And if somebody jumps in as soon as Jack opens and they’re being smart, say, “No.  We are now going to listen to Jack.  Elaborate more on this, Jack,” and coax it out of him a bit and that way, you will actually send a very strong signal to the [inaudible] 00:42:43 of just, “Shut up and listen,” and B, you actually give the other person an opportunity to put their view forward and then that view is there for the entire board to rake something off it and they might think it’s complete nonsense or it’s actually a good issue and they should consider it."
30D,30D_105,Q,"That’s great.  That explains that really well, thank you.  This question is about cognitive diversity which is different ways of thinking.  So, there’s a fair bit of talk that we want to work with about that and it says that cognitive diversity has an influence on a board’s functioning and what we want to do is find out from people like you, how does cognitive diversity influence your board’s functioning?  Is it positive, negative?  Is it contingent?  Does it depend?"
30D,30D_106,A,"Well, I think cognitive diversity, we set boundaries to diversity and probably our recruiting process corrals us into - we all pay lip service to cognitive diversity and all that.  For example, I am genuinely committed to have diverse views on the board and diverse skills and diverse ways of looking at problems but also as a group of people, you need to be able to work effectively.  When I look at the boards that I am on, there is diversity.  So, we’ve got a great deal of ladies on board, we have people with disabilities on board but not once have I seen a Kalahari Bushman on any of the boards I’m on."
30D,30D_107,A,"I bet you that a Kalahari Bushman would think about problems very differently to what we think, so I think that the diversity - so, I am absolutely certain that cognitive diversity fosters your competitive advantage as a board but I also would think that our diversity is somewhat constrained by the cultural realities we live in.  I live in Australia and therefore - and I don’t know any Kalahari Bushmen so it’d be very, very hard to get one on the board and furthermore, even if there was one, would it be - would the inclusion of that individual be making a positive contribution to the effectiveness of the board?  That person’s views would be so diverse that it could actually render the entire board ineffective."
30D,30D_108,Q,"This is a key question.  You’ve put your finger on a key question.  The question is how - on the one hand, during selection process, on the one hand you’re trying to obtain a collegiate fit because that’s really important, your board culture, being able to function that way, but on the other, trying to avoid groupthink.  Trying to avoid groupthink on the one hand but obtain collegiate fit when you’re selecting new members.  This is exactly the point I was then going to get to, and you’ve anticipated it."
30D,30D_109,A,"[Margot], that’s [hell] 00:47:07 quite frankly.  I have no idea, really.  You hope that you would be bringing in people who would not be fostering groupthink but it’s more of a statement of an aspiration an ambition than reality.  So, what do I do?  I’m interviewing for a board member and I say, “Gee Jenny, do you foster groupthink?”  I know exactly where you’re taking it but how on earth to get there, I have no idea to be honest."
30D,30D_11,Q,Is that a for-profit company?
30D,30D_110,Q,"Yeah.  So, you just hope that when you select someone, that they will think differently and will contribute to a broader understanding of the issues."
30D,30D_111,A,"I guess there are two elements to it, [Margot].  Whether they will think differently, it is my view that it is almost impossible to assess that but also, one thing is to think differently but another thing - and you can actually have a bit of an influence of that - is how assertive you are with your views and that’s a fine balance because you want - if somebody thinks, ‘No, this discussion is going in a wrong direction,’ so you want someone to be freethinking enough to say, “It’s just nonsense.  We should have a look at it from this perspective,” and have sufficient presence and confidence to express that."
30D,30D_112,A,"So, in the interview process, I don’t know whether I could reasonably even aspire to assess whether someone would think about problems more creatively, differently to what I would but maybe you can, in an interview process, gauge whether if they do have a different opinion to the other five or six people on the board, whether they would have sufficient confidence to express the fact that they are thinking something totally different to what the group is thinking and be able to do that in a positive and constructive way, rather than to upset the other board members.  You can maybe make some assessments about it in the interview process."
30D,30D_113,Q,"Okay, that’s good.  I get that.  That makes sense.  You’ve got different ways and different perspectives.  You’re measuring that with your skills matrix as an approximate -"
30D,30D_114,A,"Yes.  Well, the skills matrix, that’s quite frankly the easiest thing.  So, you say, [Margot], “Thanks for coming for the interview.  So, you’re a lawyer.  What experience have you had?”  “Well, I’ve been a family law expert.”  “That’s good.  So, how does that relate to raising equity in an international market?”  So, you can - so, the skills matrix, that’s the easy thing.  It’s the bit you’re talking about that’s not so easy."
30D,30D_115,Q,"So, you can’t approximate from that.  One person said to me that their skill matrix, they extend it to include criteria for diversity.  So, they get the basic skills - you’ve just identified a particular legal background would be useful - and then look at gender, cultural background and they try and get as many ticks as they can but the essential core skills are not negotiable."
30D,30D_116,A,"Absolutely.  That’s a great thing to do.  Actually, I touched on it earlier, [Margot].  You are 100% correct because for example, you’re looking for a lawyer so you get 10 lawyers and out of the 10 lawyers, you will find that three practise family law - and I’m making this up as an example only - and you are going to be raising equity in international debt markets."
30D,30D_117,A,"Well, maybe those three, irrespective of what their cultural backgrounds are, are not suitable but then, you might get a lawyer who is let’s say, of an Asian extraction and has actually worked in a corporate environment and then you think, “Hell, that would be really, really good to have on my board because where am I going to raise the money?  Will I go to Pakistan?  No, because they don’t have any money but I’ll go to Japan,” and there’s a whole bunch of Asian countries that you are likely to be raising money from and therefore, it would be extremely useful to have a person with the corporate skills that you need and the legal skills, plus also, the cultural sensitivity in the markets that you wish to engage with.  So, the extension of the skills matrix to accommodate other things, I think it’s a great idea."
30D,30D_118,Q,"Good, well it’s not mine personally but someone did come up with it."
30D,30D_119,A,"Doesn’t matter, appropriated."
30D,30D_12,A,"No.  It’s a member - we make profits but it’s a member organisation.  Then, I’m a member for Brain Injury SA and that’s a not-for-profit for people who are suffering with brain injury and we concentrate on their rehabilitation and to regain as useful life as they can possibly have.  I’m also a member for [inaudible] 00:02:01 Johnson [inaudible] 00:02:04 Financial Services Group, which is a normal for-profit company."
30D,30D_120,Q,Do you think that the boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to building diversity?
30D,30D_121,A,"I don’t know.  It’s a - you see, people - [Margot], I need to answer it in a different way because essentially, people on boards, the perception of directors is that they are all-knowing and really clever people and often, it’s not the case actually.  They’re definitely not all-knowing and in many, many cases, they are not that clever either and the issue about thinking very broadly about, ‘What is it that will bring me the competitive advantage vis a vis the others?’ I think that many people see it through much more hero [inaudible] 00:54:22. I’m just not sure that the sophistication of thinking in the boards is there where you can rely on it, to be honest, to be seeking diversity."
30D,30D_122,Q,"That’s really interesting.  So, it’s like there’s a myopia but this is about the board itself.  You can’t see that it’s lacking diversity and that it could benefit from diversity because that’s its nature."
30D,30D_123,A,"Well, I suspect - I could be doing a disservice to some boards - but they would pay not lip service but diversity is good because it’s good and it’s topical so that’s good, but if they really understand why actually, diversity is really, really important, they would take a different view to it, I reckon."
30D,30D_124,Q,"So, you haven’t been able to sell it to your boards?"
30D,30D_125,A,"Absolutely.  My boards are reasonably diverse actually, to be honest.  Well, I sit on one board and I’m the only bloke there so in terms of gender diversity, unless I vote myself off, I couldn’t do any better.  I sit on a board where we actually do have - and not a token person with disability - a serious board member with a disability and with a serious disability, I should point out, [inaudible] 00:56:30 good so I don’t know what else I could do.  One thing, one very important feature of boards, [Margot], is that as a board member, you are one amongst equals - and I’m not sure if you’re familiar with that."
30D,30D_126,A,"It’s derived from the Westminster system of government.  As a chairman, you are first amongst equals but the emphasis is on equals.  So, you can influence people and you can have enlightened discussions but also, the reality is that all the influencing and all the enlightened discussions will become always not sub optimised but there will be a whole bunch of issues where - day-to-day considerations.  You are not operating in isolation, [Margot]."
30D,30D_127,Q,"So, you’re one among equals and discussion brings with it a whole lot of issues, some of which are external to the board, influence external to the board of course."
30D,30D_128,A,"[Margot], let me pause you if I could."
30D,30D_129,Q,"Yeah, please."
30D,30D_13,Q,"Great.  Well, that’s three I’ve got or are there two industry association ones?"
30D,30D_130,A,"I will turn off my engine and in case it cuts us off, call me back on this number in 30 seconds but stay on the line because I don’t think that our conversation should be interrupted.  It may be interrupted just for a moment."
30D,30D_131,Q,Sure.
30D,30D_132,A,Are you there?
30D,30D_133,Q,"Yes, I’m here."
30D,30D_134,A,"Okay, fine, so we can continue."
30D,30D_135,Q,Good.
30D,30D_136,A,"So, sorry, you were asking a question."
30D,30D_137,Q,"Yeah, that’s okay.  You were talking about board process involving directors as one among equals and that there’s a discussion and the discussion brings with it, issues, a bunch of issues and then some of them are external or something you were saying."
30D,30D_138,A,"Yeah, absolutely.  Let me elaborate on that.  I think I know where you’re leading it, [Margot].  Quite frankly, you don’t go to the board meeting to discuss cultural issues or diversity issues.  You go to a board meeting to discuss the business of the organisation you’re in and you will find that the issues pertaining to the business will always and rightfully dominate the board discussion.  So, it is rare, very rare, to have the luxury where the board can just have an enlightened conversation like we are having now because normally it’s, “What is the competition doing?  What are our financial resources?”  It’s a far more business focused discussion at the board level."
30D,30D_139,Q,"Of course, yeah. Is this because I was talking about the board reflecting on itself as, “Are we diverse?  Should we be diverse?  Would we be better off if we were diverse?” so that the board doesn’t really have much time to reflect on those things and when you’re selecting new board members, you do your skills matrix and then you get your recruitment organisation to find people and you do interviews.  It’s - you don’t spend too much time reflecting on who you are as a board and how you’re operating together."
30D,30D_14,A,"Sorry, which ones?"
30D,30D_140,A,"I think that that’s true, [Margot].  I really do.  I think you’re right."
30D,30D_141,Q,"Yeah, except for when that critical moment came, there was that conflict, the director called them out, the two people and said, “You’re disrupting us.  This is not how it should be,” and there were a few ground rules set and then everyone’s moving forward and doing business as usual."
30D,30D_142,A,"Well, that’s true, [Margot], and the reason why it was called out and called out quite forcefully was because it was actually impacting on the ability of the board to conduct its day-to-day business.  So, it wasn’t called out because of some kind of an esoteric consideration.  It was, “Look.  We are not talking about the right things we should be talking about because you two don’t seem to be seeing eye to eye.  So, let’s put it on the table.  Let’s have a discussion about it and let’s get back to business for the benefit of our organisation.”  So, that was the tenor of the conversation."
30D,30D_143,Q,"Okay.  So, do you think that gender targets and quotas and that sort of thing, do you think they’re useful?"
30D,30D_144,A,"Probably not.  I think what is most useful is the - for example, let’s just simplify it.  In terms of gender targets or gender mix, I think what is most useful is to develop a cadre of experienced, capable women and then you will not need quotas because they will be hotly sought after whereas if you plonk women in - like that experience I’ve told you in 1989.  I was a young, young executive with this particular bank and the lady that we had was a highly, highly experienced academic from University of New South Wales and even then, I was looking and thinking, ‘What on earth is she contributing to it?’  I could give you one specific example where I wrote a board paper and the comments I received from her were just appalling to be honest."
30D,30D_145,A,"It just completely missed the point.  To me, the answer is if you want to increase women’s participation on boards, a good, laudable objective, think, ‘How do I get there?’ is develop a cadre of women that are capable, a la we were talking about Julie Bishop.  I could tell you, she would have zero difficulty getting on any board in Australia.  Why?  Because she’s tough, she’s knowledgeable, she knows her stuff.  Yes, I fully understand that it’s difficult for women to get experienced and all that but it’s also classically difficult for guys.  It’s not easy."
30D,30D_146,Q,"Can I just ask you a question?  We’re nearly to the last question.  There’s one more question which is just asking you to think about the future but I really like this thing you told me before about confidence.  Confidence was one of the requisites for a board member.  Capacity and confidence, that’s it.  Capacity and confidence to put their view, that’s essential and you assess that at interview.  Do you think that there could be a bias in that, an unconscious bias?  Maybe women present confidence in a different way or whatever."
30D,30D_147,A,"I think so.  Yes, I do."
30D,30D_148,Q,"So, there could be a prejudice with the interview process that people aren’t consciously aware of it."
30D,30D_149,A,"There could be, [Margot].  There are two elements to it once again.  There’s cultural difference.  For example, some cultures would have a very good idea but would not necessarily - our western culture is that we are reasonably forward with our thinking and that would be especially amongst men.  Ladies may express confidence differently quite possibly and it’s also, so may other cultures as well."
30D,30D_15,Q,I’ve got CPA -
30D,30D_150,Q,"Yes.  I’m thinking Asian cultures, open conflict is really not a thing they do and a handshake is quite different, I’ve heard."
30D,30D_151,A,"Yeah, absolutely."
30D,30D_152,Q,"These are things that would come out at interview and without an appreciation of that cultural difference, that interview process might be biased.  So, back to targets.  Targets can be a way to force people to think about the systems things that might prejudice, limit access of people from other groups, from gender differences but I would suggest that maybe it’s men on the board that you’re only one male among women.  There might be a systematic bias against men getting on it, I don’t know.  What do you think?  Why are there so few men?"
30D,30D_153,A,Why are there so few men?
30D,30D_154,Q,On the board where you’re one male among many women.
30D,30D_155,A,"Well, I don’t know.  Because the other ladies are good directors.  It really is that simple, seriously.  To be perfectly frank with you, [Margot], do I feel the least bit worried about it?  No.  Why?  Because quite frankly, when I walk into that room, there are six directors of which I’m one of.  I would deal with them in exactly the same fashion as I would deal if they were just five other guys.  I don’t perceive any bias towards me and I certainly do not treat them in any other way that I would any other director and the reason why there is this good [inaudible] 01:08:01 is that they are good directors.  They’re very competent people.  That’s the beauty of it, that they got there not because of a quota.  They got there because they’ve built up very successful businesses themselves.  They’re successful businesswomen."
30D,30D_156,Q,"Thank you for that.  The final question is looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
30D,30D_157,A,"To me, the question of diversity is secondary to the question of effectiveness of the board.  I would like to see that our boards are as effective as they possibly can be to lead organisations through what is and will continue to be a challenging business environment and if the effectiveness can be improved, the competitive advantage of the boards can be improved by having a greater cohort of - a greater cultural mix or gender mix, I’m all for it because it would only improve the effectiveness of the board."
30D,30D_158,Q,"Yeah, as a means to that end."
30D,30D_159,A,"Absolutely.  Beyond that, well, there is no other reason for a board to exist as far as I’m concerned."
30D,30D_16,A,"I think I might’ve forgotten another one, being the South Australian Electoral Commission."
30D,30D_160,Q,"Exactly.  That’s really good.  Thank you.  That was so clear.  Thank you so much for your time, [30D]."
30D,30D_161,A,"It’s a pleasure, [Margot].  If there’s any other follow-up issues, don’t hesitate to give me a call."
30D,30D_162,Q,"Thanks a lot, [30D], that’s great.  Have a nice day."
30D,30D_17,Q,"What’s that, a state - that would be a state-owned -"
30D,30D_18,A,"Yeah.  Well, it’s the electoral commission of the state of South Australia, yeah."
30D,30D_19,Q,"Great.  They’re diverse.  Okay, that’s great.  Have you sat on any other than these five boards?  Have you been on other boards in the past?"
30D,30D_2,A,Professional background or what do you mean?
30D,30D_20,A,"I have.  I’ve been a board member of the Hooker Corporation.  That’s many years ago.  I was on the board of [inaudible] 00:03:12 for a number of years, the real estate agent company.  A whole bunch of - when I was the Chief Financial Officer of [inaudible] 00:03:25, there was a whole bunch of subsidiaries that I was sitting on as a board member and then when I was a Chief Financial Officer of Jupiters Limited, I was on a number of boards so really, quite a number to be honest."
30D,30D_21,Q,And a lot of those were in the for-profit sector?
30D,30D_22,A,Absolutely.  All of them were.
30D,30D_23,Q,"Beautiful.  Well, [30D], this research is looking at board diversity and our particular perspective is not to work from theory but to ask people who are on boards or on organisations that are influencing boards what they understand board diversity to mean and how it should be managed, and its [levers] 00:04:23 and barriers, so that’s what we’ll focus on in today’s interview.  So, first, how have the composition of the boards that you’re familiar with, and it’s quite a range of them spanning 30 years, how have they changed over time in terms of diversity?"
30D,30D_24,A,"Well, diversity, I guess if I take it from a different perspective if I could, diversity in terms of skill ranges has not changed a heck of a lot.  So, consequently if you are looking [inaudible] 00:05:12 I think that fact is governed basically by my skills matrix which should be available to the board and my being present on the board.  So, typically you need - the skills that you require is a very, very strong financial skill, you need a very, very strong legal skill.  Typically, you - well, unquestionably, you need a very, very strong corporate governance skill and then depending on the organisation, you may need a marketing skill if it’s relevant.  The first few I’ve mentioned to you were the core skills.  The marketing skill can become core if the particular board role requires it."
30D,30D_25,A,"The other skills are obviously knowledge of the economic and political system that you operate in.  So, in that regard, I think that those skills are absolutely timeless and will always be required to be on the board and so from that perspective, I am not seeing any change.  If you are then asking about the composition of the board, typically those people [inaudible] 00:06:41 skill that can change and does change with time.  So, for example, I sit on one board where I am the only male.  The rest of them, five other members, are ladies and it works perfectly well, very well actually and the reason why it works very well just because each and every one of us possesses the key skills to be a competent and able director."
30D,30D_26,A,"So, that’s right now, [inaudible] 00:07:22 five ladies, one guy and that probably wouldn’t have happened 30 years ago so change from that perspective.  Now, I also sit on a board where we have a board member who has a disability but I don’t know whether that would’ve been present 30 years ago or not because that’s the Brain Injury SA board and I suspect that directors like that may have been on those boards previously.  Was that roughly what you were looking for?"
30D,30D_27,Q,"Yeah, very good.  I’m interested to know then, with the - let’s say the cognitive disability - how does that board facilitate the involvement of the person with cognitive disability so that they can be a fully competent board member in terms of those core skills?"
30D,30D_28,A,"This lady doesn’t have a cognitive disability, she has a physical disability."
30D,30D_29,Q,"Oh, okay.  I thought you said it was brain injury."
30D,30D_3,Q,"Yeah.  Are you an accountant, lawyer?"
30D,30D_30,A,"Well, actually, I shouldn’t speak so quickly because - well, I can tell that you that sitting around the board, this lady is as sharp as you and I put together.  No obvious cognitive disability but she’s a stroke sufferer so the most obvious disability is physical, not cognitive but whilst I’m able to observe the physical disability, there could be a cognitive disability which may not be obvious to me.  So, for example there, it may be that her attention span is shorter - although I haven’t observed that.  I’m just making it up now.  So, her disability was brought on by a series of strokes but her brain seems to be functioning really well.  Better than most I’d say."
30D,30D_31,Q,"Good.  Now, the gender diversity, why do you think that’s increased over time?"
30D,30D_32,A,"Well, I think that it’s becoming a societal issue that society is looking for greater involvement of women in all aspects of our society and that includes governance of corporations so that’s probably why.  I think that there is a government push to do it.  As to how exactly that is, I don’t know.  I do recall that many years ago - and I wasn’t on the board of this company.  I was an employee but I dealt a lot with the company - we did have a lady on the board of the company and it was not clear to me nor anyone else, why she was there because it was - certainly, her contribution was not that of a competent director.  So, she - I think - to be perfectly frank with you, I think that she was there, the token woman so that the board can say, “We’ve got one,” but I think those days have well and truly gone to be honest."
30D,30D_33,Q,"How long ago was that, [30D]?"
30D,30D_34,A,I can tell you exactly.  That would’ve been 1989.
30D,30D_35,Q,"’89, did you say?"
30D,30D_36,A,Yeah.
30D,30D_37,Q,"Wow, that’s a long time ago."
30D,30D_38,A,Yep.
30D,30D_39,Q,"Okay, that’s good.  Well, a lot has changed since then, hasn’t it?"
30D,30D_4,A,Okay.  I’m an accountant.
30D,30D_40,A,"I think so, yes.  I think that the world has changed as it should change and this is a personal perspective, I have the view that if you have a very highly skilled, competent group of people and it doesn’t matter whether they are girls, boys or whatever, you will always come to better decisions collectively.  So, if you have smart ladies, put them on board.  If you have smart guys, put them on board.  If you have dumb ladies, keep them as far as you can as far as I’m concerned."
30D,30D_41,Q,"So, tell me, why in 1989 - that was before we had targets, wasn’t it?"
30D,30D_42,A,Yep.
30D,30D_43,Q,"So, there was not that sort of push.  Why was a woman put on the board who didn’t have the skills?  Where was the push?"
30D,30D_44,A,"Well, I have to tell you, I was not on the board of that company and it was a large, large, listed Australian bank.  Obviously, those organisations wanted to show to the government how enlightened they are so whilst there were no targets, they were going to be corporate leaders so they got themselves a token woman."
30D,30D_45,Q,"Okay, so it was a branding issue."
30D,30D_46,A,"Yeah.  They go, “Have we got a woman on the board?  Of course we do.  There she is.”"
30D,30D_47,Q,"Great, thank you.  We’ll be revisiting this as we go through.  The next question I’d like to clarify is, let’s say I give you a scale of the importance that you would give to a board being diverse.  So, how important do you think it is to have a diverse board?  10 is it’s extremely important and one is not important at all.  Where would you rate it?"
30D,30D_48,A,"Well, I would rate it at 10 if you are looking at the skill diversity which I described earlier.  If you are then saying gender diversity or ethnic diversity, I would score it much lower or lower than that because the overriding objective is to have a very, very highly competent board.  So, competence - diversity in skill is absolutely paramount and how you get that diversity of skill really is of a secondary importance I think.  How can I answer your question better?  Because you’re trying obviously to rate the [over talk] 00:15:13."
30D,30D_49,Q,This is good.  This is really a way to generate discussion.  The sort of clarification that you’re making is what we want.  It’s not the number so this is good.
30D,30D_5,Q,"And the boards that you’ve been on or that you are on - first of all, for how many years have you been a board director?"
30D,30D_50,A,"Okay.  Once again, it is a contextual thing because let’s say that I’m on a board of the Australian submarine corporation and I was their Chief Financial Officer in my previous life, right?  [Inaudible] 00:16:01 what did we make?  We made warships, submarines and destroyers.  Well, quite frankly, whether I would have an ethnic or sex - gender diversity on there, probably far less important.  If on the other hand for example, I am on the board of a house construction company, I think it would be absolutely vital.  Why?  Because the people who interact with your clients, half of them are women and actually, women make a very important contribution into selection of houses and people - if you have a female or a bunch of females on the board, we can say, “Look guys.”  When I go and look for a house, these are the features which I find important."
30D,30D_51,A,"So, then, you see - so, the diversity is important only in as far as it gets you a superior outcome over your competitor.  For example - this might not - this might surprise you but do you know where it’s also very important to have diversity?  For motor vehicle companies because actually, it’s the females who make the majority of the motor car buying decisions, not the guy.  So, [inaudible] 00:17:40 to understand what is it that that segment of the market looks for?  And target it and make sure they feel product development [inaudible] 00:17:49."
30D,30D_52,Q,"Okay.  Upfront, you said one of the core skills was knowledge of the context for certain - like the political and social context of the industry.  When you were talking about the core skills, you said financial, legal and corporate governance and then you said depending on the business, marketing, knowledge of the context, the legal, political, social.  So, that knowledge of the context, it’s certain stakeholders like the political stakeholders, the regulatory stakeholders, the financial stakeholders or whatever.  I don’t know.  So, you mentioned consumers but it seems that going back to your earlier point, there’s also politics and regulators."
30D,30D_53,A,"Absolutely.  It’s actually much more so for large organisations than small organisations but large organisations operate in an environment where they interact with governments.  So, for example, let’s be very specific here [inaudible] 00:19:21 really an example, [Margot] 00:19:22 -"
30D,30D_54,Q,"Yeah, sure."
30D,30D_55,A,"If we were a - I don’t know what kind of company but I tell you what, I would be absolutely hot on the tracks of Julie Bishop to join my company and the board of my company.  Why?  For example, if I was a construction company, if I was John Holland for example or [inaudible] 00:19:48, I really would want Julie Bishop to be there.  Why?  Because she’s a seriously intelligent woman.  She’s a lawyer and B, she knows the political lay of the land better than most people in this world.  So, the context is very, very important but once again, it’s always in a context of how do I structure the board such that I have a competitive advantage over the other people in my industry?"
30D,30D_56,Q,"That’s nice.  That’s consistent with a couple of other interviewees that have come from the for-profit sector and the not-for-profit, instead of competitive advantage, I could probably put services to the community, delivery of -"
30D,30D_57,A,"I don’t think there is that much of a difference, [Margot] and I’ll tell you why."
30D,30D_58,Q,Did you say there’s not much or there is?
30D,30D_59,A,"I don’t think so and I’m just starting to think about it with you so we’re having a conversation.  So, because you see, the descriptor ‘not-for-profit’ is complete and utter nonsense because not-for-profit organisations feel it’s bad to make profit.  Well, I don’t believe so.  I’m a chairman of Brain Injury SA and we try to be a financially stable, profitable company with one gigantic difference to - we don’t give our profits to the shareholders.  We reinvest it all into the company to make a better contribution to the people who need our services and we can do it far better if we are financially stable, if we make profits, but only for the purpose of reinvestment for the benefit of our members, of our clients."
30D,30D_6,A,30 years.
30D,30D_60,A,"So, this issue of competitive advantage in the not-for-profit sector I think is as alive and well as it is in the commercial sector because for example, we are dealing with a whole bunch of - the introduction of NDIS.  So, we can see that many of our competitors will go by the wayside because they have not prepared for it properly but also, we can see that a number of service providers will try to encroach onto the markets which we currently have and therefore, we need to be able to continue to deliver outstanding service to our clients to be able to compete and board leadership is vital."
30D,30D_61,A,"Therefore, why would you not have people with disability on your board?  Because they provide you with a perspective which an able-bodied person just couldn’t because you just can’t put yourself into the shoes of the other person adequately."
30D,30D_62,Q,"That’s great.  I get it.  I see your - so, this imperative or ‘how do I structure the board for competitive advantage’ applies across for-profit and not-for-profit sectors.  It’s just the reason you’re doing it is a little different.  One is for service delivery to a community and the other is -"
30D,30D_63,A,"Well, is to make a profit."
30D,30D_64,Q,"Yeah, is to make the profit sustainably."
30D,30D_65,A,"I think so, [Margot], because quite frankly, if you fail as a profit-making entity, you’re gone and if you fail as a not-for-profit entity, you’re gone as well.  So, the ability to survive is important in both instances."
30D,30D_66,Q,"Excellent.  So, another person discussed how to draw - if you’re looking for characteristics of a diverse board, so you’ve got the people with the skills and the people are from diverse backgrounds, gender, culture or whatever, where do you draw the line?  You can’t have a million people on the board so you have to be selective.  What’s your criteria?  And she said it was about what is the strategic intent of the organisation and what’s it aiming to achieve and then what stakeholders do we need to engage with in order to do that?  And then, that -"
30D,30D_67,A,"Sorry, too many questions there, [Margot].  It’s a complex question you’re asking me.  So, [over talk] 00:25:24 if you would please.  So, start again.  Ask the question but do it maybe in parts."
30D,30D_68,Q,"Yeah, good point.  I’m just wondering - okay, you’ve talked about how do I structure the board for competitive advantage and in the not-for-profit sector, you’ve told me how it differs to the for-profit in purpose.  How do you select members so that you don’t have groupthink or good decision making?"
30D,30D_69,A,"Well, obviously for me, it always starts with a skills matrix.  So, what skills do I need to be able to make effective decisions and lead the organisation effectively?  So, that’s number one and then you look for specialist skills which would be beneficial to furthering your competitiveness in whatever industry you’re in.  I’m not sure that it actually answered your question.  Now, [Margot], could I just make a suggestion to you please?"
30D,30D_7,Q,"Wow, okay.  You’ve got a good span to reflect on.  That will be really valuable, thank you.  How many do you currently sit on?"
30D,30D_70,Q,"Yeah, sure."
30D,30D_71,A,"I need to go and jump in my car and drive to my next appointment, which is about – [I don’t know how] [inaudible] 00:27:02 with this interview [inaudible] 00:27:04 so [inaudible] 00:27:07 just jump in my car and we can chat as I go?"
30D,30D_72,Q,"Yeah, absolutely.  Not a problem."
30D,30D_73,A,"Hang on.  So, keep going."
30D,30D_74,Q,"Okay, good."
30D,30D_75,A,"I don’t think I’ve answered your question because your question was very much in line of how do you go about selecting a board and I said there’s a skills matrix and then from the skills matrix, you draw people in.  It’s important to have boards which are a good size and that doesn’t mean really gigantic boards because you don’t want - sorry, just a door has been opened."
30D,30D_76,Q,"That’s okay, I can hear."
30D,30D_77,A,"It’s just not an issue of having a debating society kind of thing.  One thing which is important when you’re selecting a board member, if you are looking for example, for a key skill, say, a legal skill and you are in a not-for-profit which requires disability experience, you can get a lawyer who actually fits both things and you’re on a winner because you don’t want to have a 15-member strong board.  You want to have six members on board.  That’s why you always try to select people who fit as many criteria that are important to you as possible."
30D,30D_78,Q,"Okay.  So, do you see - how do you understand board diversity?  What does it mean to you?  I think we should clarify that now.  You’ve mentioned gender."
30D,30D_79,A,"Well, the diversity means diversity of skill.  That’s, as I tell you, my [inaudible] 00:29:32.  It could also mean gender diversity, not just an all-boys club.  Also, it can mean an ethnic diversity."
30D,30D_8,A,Five.
30D,30D_80,Q,What sort of diversity?
30D,30D_81,A,"Ethnic diversity, cultural diversity.  So, they are the - it can also mean diversity in abled and disabled persons across various factors.  That’s how I understand it."
30D,30D_82,Q,"Yep.  Some people talk about approaches to problem-solving, different approaches to problem-solving or cognitive diversity.  Do you think that’s important?"
30D,30D_83,A,"Yeah, very, because you see, we all make decisions in very different ways, and we see problems from different perspectives.  If you just stack the board with people whose cognitive processes are very similar, you will be totally sub optimising the board.  The old saying that ‘it’s amazing how many problems look like a nail when the only tool you have is a hammer’ becomes absolutely crystal clear.  So, it is important to have a board which can think in different ways about an issue and you will find that invariably, that kind of process will lead to far richer decision making and better decision making, unquestionably actually."
30D,30D_84,A,"I’ve experienced it many times both as an executive but also a number of times as a board member that you really just – but there’s one thing actually, [Margot], which I think is absolutely important for boards, is that boards must have - a successful board member, be it any board member whether it’s - whatever the diversity of a board member is, it must have a collegiate mindset."
30D,30D_85,A,"They must be able to and want to work in a collegiate manner with the other board members because then, you actually really unleash a different thinking about the problem.  You might see problems and you think, ‘The solution is that,’ and then somebody says, “Or is it?  Why don’t we have a look at it from this perspective?” and then you might think, ‘Actually, yeah.  Why don’t we look at it from that perspective?’ it will become very clear that there is another perspective over and above what you have immediately thought of."
30D,30D_86,Q,"Brilliant.  Now, how would you cultivate a board that has this collegiate mindset?"
30D,30D_87,A,"It’s not easy and [inaudible] 00:33:15 board meeting that I attended last month, May, it really - there was a very distinct lack of collegiality about the way we were treating each other and fortunately, one of the board members just said, “Look, I’m fed up with this.  I’m not putting up with it.  I want to work with you very differently,” and actually, she put it on as a discussion item and said, “I think that you and you,” and pointed to two directors, “I think that you’re not getting on very well and your relationship is influencing the way I work on the board and I suspect it’s also influencing how others work on the board.”"
30D,30D_88,A,"She was absolutely right and it actually was quite - it actually cleared a lot of the issues.  I think that the two individuals had agendas.  It’s a good idea to confront the people and really - in a not very politically correct way - bang their heads together and say, “Listen guys or girls, this isn’t working,” and incidentally, this was the board where I’m the only guy.  The other board members were ladies so they weren’t wilting lilies in any sense.  [Inaudible] 00:34:52 called them out and said, “Look, you and you, you’re not behaving well and I’m not having this so let’s sort ourselves out.”  So, I think that personally, that a direct approach is best."
30D,30D_89,Q,"So, that conflict that emerged, you said it was agendas, they had different agendas, was that to do with different allegiances or different ways of thinking?  What was the root cause of the conflict between these two people?"
30D,30D_9,Q,And what kind of boards are these?
30D,30D_90,A,Ambition.
30D,30D_91,Q,"Oh, it was the ego, okay.  Power game."
30D,30D_92,A,"It was actually put on the table and then all of a sudden it came out, “Well, you’ve made the following promises to me that if I do this, you’d do that,” and my contribution was, “I don’t give a damn who made what contribution and what promises to whom because actually, the decision will not be made by what promises were made.  The decision will be made by the board.  So, if you were foolish enough to make those promises and you were foolish enough to believe them, then you’re both wrong.”  I think it actually was quite an atmosphere clearing discussion to be honest."
30D,30D_93,Q,"So, did it effectively set new ground rules for the board?"
30D,30D_94,A,"Well, hopefully but you will find that things like this, [Margot], it’s literally like learning to ride a bicycle.  I don’t know, have you ridden a bicycle in your life?"
30D,30D_95,Q,Yeah.
30D,30D_96,A,"Okay, well you might remember that when you were learning to ride a bicycle that you were extremely wobbly and you probably fell off a few times and you had to get back on and keep going.  So, these things I find, we are still at the wobbly stage and we will probably redress the bad behaviour and then it must be made very clear to everything that, “No, we are going back to the bad old ways.  We are not going there.  We’re not doing this.  This is the right path to go.”  You have to hit it hard and point our very publicly, “This is not the way we are going to behave in this environment and the way to go forward is like this and we fully expect you and you to play by the rules.”"
30D,30D_97,Q,"And the rules are about what the board’s purpose is, what the board is about, not what their personal agenda is.  Is that the -"
30D,30D_98,A,"Spot on, 100% correct.  No hidden agendas, no little sidebars that somebody whispers into someone’s ears and, “Well, she promised me that,” and, “Okay, you may have been foolish enough to promise and you may have been even more foolish to believe it but none of it matters.”"
30D,30D_99,Q,"So, this rule changing, this clarification of the board’s purpose and the way it runs, works, that will facilitate a diversity because it will allow for the inclusion of voices as long as they are aligned with the purpose of the board.  So, it separates out your agenda from - you bring your different views and that’s all about the purpose of the board and the problem solving for the board.  Is that -"
31IN,31IN_1,Q,Have you any questions about the research before we start?
31IN,31IN_10,A,I guess governance or law is my training. I’m a lawyer by background but I’ve spent 12 years in investment in ESG.
31IN,31IN_100,A,Again that’s part of that I think tick the box or the narrow set of considerations to that broader –
31IN,31IN_101,Q,"Culminating in a dialogue between you and the boards, partnering to facilitate improved performance and sustainable performance. That’s a really interesting model. I’m starting to get a feel for it. That’s good. Thank you. Do you think you would change that importance rating in any particular context or situation, perhaps high risk, high uncertainty?"
31IN,31IN_102,A,"To the earlier point about, you don’t I guess judge boards and organisations by, is there a lawyer, an accountant, a basic template. It’s similar for diversity. Taking the example of geographic diversity, it’s just simply impossible to have every geography that BHP is a part of, represented on its board, sort of United Nations type thing."
31IN,31IN_103,Q,Exactly.
31IN,31IN_104,A,"There’s always that or for the Telstra board, should every Telstra customer have customer representation when you have millions of them? I think you can’t go down that path but I think that broader – diversity of skills, experience, gender, all of those paths I think are relevant across and in challenging times it may be hard to get to your point I think or when the question is –"
31IN,31IN_105,Q,"The risk and uncertainty, whether there are some times when diversity is not important."
31IN,31IN_106,A,I think in any case it’s not diversity for diversity’s sake. As long as you have the relevant people skills that’s still important but it’s not for the sake of diversity. It’s actually –
31IN,31IN_107,Q,"For groupthink, to avoid groupthink."
31IN,31IN_108,A,"Yeah, that’s right. I guess taking some diversity out of the equation but even that opportunity for challenge among directors. Obviously collegiate decision-making bodies but you want the space where people can challenge ideas. Even in difficult circumstances I think a lot of boards would to like to ask, is it a really important thing to have? That you obviously make decisions as a group and you need that cabinet solidarity, absolutely but as things are being tested or even in those trying times it’s valuable to have that."
31IN,31IN_109,Q,I had one director say that’s where you most need it.
31IN,31IN_11,Q,So is that commercial law?
31IN,31IN_110,A,Absolutely. That’s very true.
31IN,31IN_111,Q,That’s good. Do you want to flesh out what board diversity means to you or we’ll leave it with what you’ve said already?
31IN,31IN_112,A,"I think we’ve covered a lot of it. I also think it will evolve over time as well and there are particular challenges for Australian boards in that area about – everyone says we don’t want technology experience. The person who’s at the forefront of Silicon Valley, the token 30-year-old billionaire, start-up person, do they want to come back for 12 long drawn-out board meetings in Australia for a nonexecutive director salary? Or even, would they be the technical boffin but what understanding of the accounts or all those other hugely important aspects of being a director would they bring? Because you can’t just be a subject matter expert, you actually need a commercial overview. I think that’s a big challenge. Finding the right directors, expanding the talent pool are all major concerns or challenges for Australian boards so certainly haven’t –"
31IN,31IN_113,Q,"I’ve interviewed some start-up, people from start-ups in the IT area and they’re amazing. They’re really highly energised but a common thread across the three I interviewed is that they really wanted to be in a board where they could learn. They’ll only go where they feel they’re learning so the culture of the board was really important to them. If they found themselves in a really conservative, where there wasn’t the dialogue and [unclear] 00:31:09, they would not like it."
31IN,31IN_114,A,"I actually was in a conference in San Francisco speaking on Australian governance trends and so on and in one of the other panels there was somebody who had been doing a lot of work for boards in Silicon Valley. The interesting part was they had all these IPOs where they would have the founder retains a stake and there’s dual class shares so they can never be moved basically. He was the headhunter for boards and said, “Find us a nonexecutive director.” A lot of nonexecutive directors will say, “I don’t want to be part of that board because there’s effectively no power and the founder is so entrenched within the – they’re not interested in challenge or an outside voice or oversight. They just want to add names.” I think that can be a challenge here."
31IN,31IN_115,A,"I think the other side as well to all governance issues like that is being fit for purpose so for very small companies, size, scope of the board is different. It’s smaller. The role of directors can be quite challenging too because in those small companies often they’re asked to roll up their sleeves or we’re 20 people in the organisation, whereas if you’re on the board of BHP you have multiday board meetings. You have a huge secretariat. You have experts and support staff and independent advisers untapped whereas some of those smaller ones –"
31IN,31IN_116,Q,"It’s like a three-hour meeting, that’s not a really –"
31IN,31IN_117,A,That’s right or how do we – you’re actually almost tackling the issues along with them and trying to –
31IN,31IN_118,Q,More operational as well.
31IN,31IN_119,A,You may be learning but you’re there and a lot of people are learning from you.
31IN,31IN_12,A,"Yeah. I did an LLM actually focusing on commercial law whilst at ACSI but proudly I’ve never practiced it, proudly."
31IN,31IN_120,Q,But you don’t tend to deal with that kind of organisations?
31IN,31IN_121,A,"ASX 300 companies so some of the smaller ones, very different to the BHP board or the some of the global boards."
31IN,31IN_122,Q,It says does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others to you?
31IN,31IN_123,A,"I think it’s really hard. I mean a bit like the question of independence and somebody’s independence of mind, it’s really hard to assess. I think gender has been a really important issue for ACSI and many investors because it’s inherently observable. It’s such a huge pool of talented candidates. If we think I’m sure of your students in the university or other people you think smart people in the population are spread across and suddenly 50% of that talent pool of the really smart best minds are off the table, already you have that – there’s a name for it that they use, sort of stupidity curve. You’re in the stupidity curve if you’re – I think they use it in the US but clearly 50% of the population being off the table. All of those other factors are important."
31IN,31IN_124,A,"I guess it depends on your definition. I think things like industry experience, knowledge and so on, that’s the nonnegotiable of all boards. NAB had a board with had no banking experience in the very early 2000s and we saw how that played out at the time. Fairfax had the same with media. That kind of core industry experience is obviously critical. I think those others, it’s as they are relevant depending on where the company’s operations are."
31IN,31IN_125,Q,Their strategies at the time.
31IN,31IN_126,A,Strategies.
31IN,31IN_127,Q,"Cognitive diversity, I should mention the term. What do you think about that and how does it connect with the idea of groupthink that you were talking about?"
31IN,31IN_128,A,I guess I was trying to get to that point with that independence of mind or cognitive diversity so I think obviously critical. From the outside looking in as investors actually it’s extremely hard and I’m sure as a researcher it’s extremely hard to get a sense of it. I guess you’d know it when you see it in a way and boards will often talk about that. That’s where I think some of backgrounds and experience and other parts matter because that gives you some of that –
31IN,31IN_129,Q,A different way of seeing things and problem solving.
31IN,31IN_13,Q,"Careful, I have [unclear] 00:01:08."
31IN,31IN_130,A,"Yeah, not always but it can. We had a speaker, a senior company director, very experienced. She was in the AICD board and I remember her saying that [unclear] 00:36:30 White Anglo-Saxon Protestant or the male, pale and stale issue but we can then become male, female, pale and stale if we don’t look at these other factors."
31IN,31IN_131,Q,Keep moving on.
31IN,31IN_132,A,"I think the cognitive element is partly there as well. One chairman expressed to me once. He said that actually with things like board renewal and age and refreshment and so on, actually you’re having someone with a different background or perspective. They may come in and ask the dumb question but actually the rest of the board often think, yes, with a fresh set of eyes that’s he right thing to be asking whereas he said that if you’ve been on a board for 10 years it could be more of a challenge to actually ask that question because you think, we’ve covered it somewhere else or I should know this or I’m pretty sure we’ve dealt with that issue. But someone new to the place can actually say, “Explain to me why.” You’re not as closed perhaps or invested that you can ask some of those questions as you walk in."
31IN,31IN_133,Q,"I think with research you can read theory and whatever but if you talk to people in the field they will tell you something and it’s fresh and it will make you think about how you’ve understood it. It’s like, you’re on the board. You understand the organisation strategy. Someone new comes and they ask a question and it makes you rethink."
31IN,31IN_134,A,"Yeah, why do we it this way? Can you just explain to me? That’s right. I think that’s one of those great benefits of that cognitive diversity as well."
31IN,31IN_135,Q,It could help to affirm or to create an awareness of a new opportunity you haven’t thought about.
31IN,31IN_136,A,"I’m sure a lot of the directors you’d speak to would talk to this, that actually having boards create that space where cognitive diversity is valued as well and the same with gender diversity. It’s like, that’s the two women weighing in on that issue or that’s the black-hatted thinker over there. Making sure every voice is brought in. Clearly against collegiate and so on but it’s actually partly having the space where those things are actually valued and taken on the board."
31IN,31IN_137,Q,"A number of interviewees, they took me here to the word of the inclusion. Is the board inclusive and then how does it do that? This I think is what you’re alluding to, creating the space, that ability of some boards to really cash in on the diversity around the table by creating this space for dialogue."
31IN,31IN_138,A,"Even I think from the outside looking in or maybe boards in the past did this where it was sort of, we have an audit matter. Let’s ask the former accountant on the board to [unclear] 00:39:46 on that and then we’ll move to the next mining issue and the miner will talk. Actually, it’s having everyone engage on every issue which gives you that benefit, rather than just rely on one person for that."
31IN,31IN_139,Q,Like reporting.
31IN,31IN_14,A,"Yeah, that’s right."
31IN,31IN_140,A,That’s right.
31IN,31IN_141,Q,"The woman I interviewed this morning, she referred to it. She’s a chair of this one and she says all those reports, that’s just dealt with, that’s just background. What are we doing with them is the focus of the discussion and that’s always a discussion."
31IN,31IN_142,A,Some big boards have actually set a four-page maximum board papers for their –
31IN,31IN_143,Q,Really?
31IN,31IN_144,A,Yeah. There’s a couple out there I know that have – again I think over time that push to say shorten the packs. They might have a committee or other offline meetings.
31IN,31IN_145,Q,To deal with stuff.
31IN,31IN_146,A,"If it can’t be summarised or distilled otherwise, you’re just filling up pages for the sake of it."
31IN,31IN_147,Q,Sharing information rather than using it to make decisions.
31IN,31IN_148,A,"Yeah, or to monitor on other things."
31IN,31IN_149,Q,That’s really interesting. We’d like to understand how diversity influences board functioning. We’ve talked about that.
31IN,31IN_15,Q,"You’re an institutional investor I guess, you shaped that. Your influence, what industries? Only super?"
31IN,31IN_150,A,"Part of it as well is sometimes people have been investors in their professional life. When you engage with them, I’ll actually say here’s how this stakeholder would want us to manage their capital or a superfund wants this type of return for its members. That’s important to us and sometimes that –"
31IN,31IN_151,Q,Putting the hat of the consumer on so to speak.
31IN,31IN_152,A,That’s right. That’s one side I guess about this increasing engagement. We see it as a positive because actually those boards get more outside voices or perceptions of their organisation.
31IN,31IN_153,Q,The ones with?
31IN,31IN_154,A,"The ones who would go out and engage with investors and others and media and actually go to bank branches or spend more time in their organisations and connect with management beyond the CEO. They actually I think get a richer view. There was one director I remember talking about, the board should be able to smell the smoke coming under the door, was his example and 20 years ago boards would almost be the last to find out about a regulatory issue or issue with customers or other things in the company whereas now –"
31IN,31IN_155,Q,They should be on the radar.
31IN,31IN_156,A,"The Royal Commission is maybe one example but I guess the issue with customers and other things, you would think there are all sorts of ways to get that perspective or to look at those issues because – I understand it’s a challenge in bigger organisations but getting feedback from external parties or at least getting an understanding of the perception of the company from different views that actually the boards see that as hugely valuable. Actually investors see it as valuable because they get a sense of who are the boards appointing and what’s their view on strategy and how does it align –"
31IN,31IN_157,Q,With our view of what’s a good investment opportunity for us.
31IN,31IN_158,A,Yeah. It’s been quite rich on both sides I think.
31IN,31IN_159,Q,"I’m seeing then an image of the organisation as being very much part of its community, engaging, open and the board being therefore, aware of the regulatory and the consumer and other stakeholder interest groups. Strategy is ongoing and responsive or whatever."
31IN,31IN_16,A,"Yes, super and I guess investments."
31IN,31IN_160,A,"I think some of the biggest risks previously with some of those companies where the CEO would manage all communication with the board and deliver the papers or whatever else and be the one point of interaction, how the culture of those places ran, no one was aware or they couldn’t speak to other people in management, or if they did the CEO was there, or it was scripted, and all those other parts. Directors have shared a lot of those types of experiences, and say, then you’re not really getting a full picture whereas many of the executive teams of today actually encourage that, be it within the board meeting or elsewhere to interact with different people in the business, go a few layers down, again do site visits in other parts on an ongoing basis to get that sense of the organisation."
31IN,31IN_161,Q,Transparency between the board and its management. It’s all one.
31IN,31IN_162,A,"The values and all of those things as well because otherwise, you sign off on a great-looking policy on Collins Street about safety or whatever it is but then if the people in the organisation don’t know about it or care about it what good is it?"
31IN,31IN_163,Q,No and they’re hiding their mistakes.
31IN,31IN_164,A,That’s right. We can’t speak up here.
31IN,31IN_165,Q,"Exactly. Don’t tell the board, exactly. So this is the risk that there is myopia from lack of transparency."
31IN,31IN_166,A,Diversity is not a silver bullet for these things but I think it’s –
31IN,31IN_167,Q,I wonder how it connects. How do you think it connects or how does your organisation would you see connect?
31IN,31IN_168,A,I feel like I’m going in so many tangents.
31IN,31IN_169,Q,It’s all right. Qualitative research is good.
31IN,31IN_17,Q,"Super, like self-managed superfunds?"
31IN,31IN_170,A,"I think that greater interest in engaging internal and external stakeholders, diversity is partly is a function of that. If you see yourself as there on behalf of shareholders and more about the company and sitting above the culture and strategy and overseeing the management team, the company shareholders, its customers, employees, all these people are critical to that, its interaction with governments. Anyway, most good directors really see that quite strongly."
31IN,31IN_171,Q,Interactions with multiple stakeholders is another form of diversity because you have their views then you bring to the table.
31IN,31IN_172,A,Or if you’re a more diverse group I think you’re more likely to do that.
31IN,31IN_173,Q,I imagine.
31IN,31IN_174,A,"Your former CEOs maybe talk to the CEO, I don’t know."
31IN,31IN_175,Q,Very unique. This is great. Thank you. It’s a different image that’s coming up. It’s good. We’ll speak more generally now. What do you see is the main barriers to building diversity on Australian boards and how do they work?
31IN,31IN_176,A,I think all sorts of things. I think you have an extremely narrow or you have had still a relatively narrow pool of directors and part of that is relationship-driven so someone had to be hiring for a role. I guess someone you know is lower risk than someone you don’t or can you get a referral from a colleague and so on. I think that’s the challenge.
31IN,31IN_177,Q,When you say narrow do you mean not many or they’re not diverse?
31IN,31IN_178,A,"Both. I think both and also I think boards can fall into the trap of hiring in their own image. I’m a former CEO of this company. I’ll appoint the next, whoever is in my role prior to that or who’s the next head of KPMG after the one that’s just retired. I think hiring in their own image has been a big issue. People bag the search firms a lot or as contributing to that narrowness but I think the other thing we hear is that chairs and nomination committees actually want to find people outside the pool or add a new skill. If they get served up the same names they can actually ask for more and they’ve challenged that and changed that a bit. You see some very large companies who do appoint people that aren’t sitting on other ASX 200 boards. They just go outside the usual suspects."
31IN,31IN_179,Q,Your organisation would be comfortable with that?
31IN,31IN_18,A,"No. Some of our members, we call them asset owners. IFM investors are a member because they owned not-for-profit funds and we had the New South Wales Treasury Corp and other similar institutions. They’re not superfunds per se."
31IN,31IN_180,A,"Absolutely. I think the other side is sometimes boards say, “He or she is on these other three companies. That must be fine.” That doesn’t tell you that much about what they’ll add to your business."
31IN,31IN_181,Q,"They’re less likely to threaten the decision making processes or something, disrupt it but how well will they contribute?"
31IN,31IN_182,A,"I guess there is that natural challenge of I guess the time commitment of boards, the level of knowledge and liability and other requirements. If you can’t understand the accounts or other things I think that’s pretty tough to be a director, no matter what your sort of background. Interesting, I mean clearly former CEOs of listed companies and others or executives at the front of the queue would be overrepresented in the pool. Questions about other backgrounds being brought in. If you run a private company or a university or a hospital or something like that, does that qualify?"
31IN,31IN_183,Q,Help you with BHP.
31IN,31IN_184,A,"I think it could in all sorts of places but does it actually get you in on to the radar? Again, we had a conversation the other night at the 30% Club about that. Does it even –"
31IN,31IN_185,Q,Seem relevant.
31IN,31IN_186,A,"Yeah, or you get into the [unclear] 00:51:06 list, probably not. To the relationship side, I mean clearly and it was explored the other night. There wasn’t a certain element and you saw it with the AICD’s mentoring program when it was first run. Effectively they found hugely-qualified women so people who run international law firms or have been executives of all these other things then paired them up with an existing male chair in the ASX 100. Often all those male chairs would do – somebody said this to us. It was like, “She didn’t need my help” but the help was I’ll introduce you to Egon Zehnder and then vouch for you as, here’s this really smart board candidate. Here’s her background, over to you and then that vouching process actually made a difference."
31IN,31IN_187,A,"I think to that world of relationships, and again it came out the other night in the conversation they would hear of a thousand coffees. I think that is still alive and well, interconnections with the board. I’m chair here and you sit on this board. You’re chair there and I’ll – those things are still very much alive and well."
31IN,31IN_188,Q,How it works.
31IN,31IN_189,A,People are vouched for or they have a name and often want somebody as one ASX 100 board [unclear] 00:52:29 because it’s almost like you’re anointed now to the [unclear] 00:52:34.
31IN,31IN_19,Q,But they’re not –
31IN,31IN_190,Q,The cluster effect. This is the same as five years ago?
31IN,31IN_191,A,"I think it is broadening over time but using the lens of gender diversity I think it also demonstrates it as well, particularly with the initial push around this or 30% was first introduced. You’d have boards looking narrowly and saying, who are that small group of highly-qualified women that are now the 10% of directors? So Catherine Livingstone or all of these hugely-qualified people, can I just now invite them to their 5th or 6th or 7th board seat?  It showed that there’s a narrow pool and it was referring back to itself. Whereas our reaction or our response to many boards was, there are all these other qualified candidates. You actually just need to look. You need to have some tokenism for a couple of companies. I know headhunters who are called and said, “Can you find two women candidates for our board?” They said, “What are the criteria?” and they said, “It doesn’t matter.”"
31IN,31IN_192,Q,That’s insulting.
31IN,31IN_193,A,"Yeah and it was like, you should think of some because that’s pretty – sort of hang up the phone there and we’ll talk again. I think that’s largely gone and I think that was in that early time of, geez, we’ve never done anything on this. Quick, let’s try and change or improve so we’ll invited Catherine Livingstone or we’ll do that. As we all know Catherine was a successful CEO of Cochlear, so ASX 50 company, that standard background. But going beyond I think is the challenge but people seem to be doing more often now."
31IN,31IN_194,Q,The female network is pretty strong. I’ve interviewed a couple of pretty top female board members who are on a number of boards and there’s a whole group of enrichment. There’s a whole group of women who are on boards that meet once a quarter or something.
31IN,31IN_195,A,"Again it’s that shared knowledge. It’s becoming more and more common I think with nonexecutives generally. I think the annoying part of us – Graeme Samuel was out saying there’s this club of – if anything there might be a director’s club or a narrow pool but I think that’s male and female, particularly in a situation where I think about 10% of chairs in the ASX 200 are women. The idea that women were somehow controlling the supply of directors to boards or this narrow niche, I just have not seen that and it’s quite bizarre because it’s still that 70/30 split the other way. I think the challenge, again male and female, kind of expanding that pool over time so people are really busy or sitting across boards. It’s actually, who are the other people that can –"
31IN,31IN_196,Q,Would you do anything to help build the pool of women or build diversity?
31IN,31IN_197,A,We’re really interested in that area.
31IN,31IN_198,Q,What do you do?
31IN,31IN_199,A,"We’ve done things to influence individual companies including, we’ve had policies to fight against all-male boards in the ASX 200 because we’ve had years of engagement so that has been hugely beneficial particularly inviting people. When we started there were 52 zeros and now there are four so three years later."
31IN,31IN_2,A,"No, not all. I’m aware of the other research done in this space, and it’s great, sort of more focused. I think we met briefly at the 30% Club party the other night."
31IN,31IN_20,A,We just do asset owners.
31IN,31IN_200,Q,You’re doing well.
31IN,31IN_201,A,"It actually does change that and that has increased the pool but I think doing more work on one of the blocks. Is it the role of the search firm? Is it nomination committees? Is it backgrounds? Is it the pipeline? We haven’t bought too hugely into the director pipeline. I think long term it’s absolutely critical and the representation of women and management in companies is critical. But particularly in the early days if I think about the ASX 200 and its goal of around 30%, we’re talking about a pool of 1,200 people and the sorts of numbers and so on. There was one point in time people were saying, “There’s no talent pool” and you think this is 50 people or 50 appointments that need to be made to really make a huge difference. I’m pretty sure there’s 50 people –"
31IN,31IN_202,Q,Incredible women up there.
31IN,31IN_203,A,"Yeah, exactly. I think too much can be made of that. We won’t find a list of company, ex-CEOs and it’s like, that’s true but you’ll actually need financial experts. You’ll need all of these other backgrounds on the board. To that point, as you say, mining is way behind and there are no women in mining and so on. I think that’s not true from the point being made. But the other thing was healthcare. It was one of the biggest laggards."
31IN,31IN_204,Q,I know.
31IN,31IN_205,A,"You’d say, there are no women in healthcare. Predominantly female actually right through the chain to not just –"
31IN,31IN_206,Q,Until the exec.
31IN,31IN_207,A,"Even the exec, it depends on the company, and middle management, there has been definitely a glass ceiling in a couple of them. But females actually at senior levels, actually they are more diverse, particularly compared to mining and others are way more. But it was just getting on to the board then of Ramsay Health Care or –"
31IN,31IN_208,Q,Healthscope.
31IN,31IN_209,A,"Yeah, those was more of a challenge at the time."
31IN,31IN_21,Q,"Asset owners, beautiful."
31IN,31IN_210,Q,"Interesting, isn’t it? It’s come down a bit which is a bit disappointing. Probably one of those females who are on a lot of boards has retired or something. I don’t know."
31IN,31IN_211,A,I think it will continue.
31IN,31IN_212,Q,It’s the final question now. Looking 10 years into the future how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards and why do you think this would be good?
31IN,31IN_213,A,"I think again that richer – in a way it’s to achieve that cognitive diversity to effectively have better decision making or boards that more reflect – I think the companies that they oversee or the industries they’re a part of, I think that’s a really important aspect, not only for their workforce but more broadly. If you have a narrow set of backgrounds on a board you –"
31IN,31IN_214,Q,You’re going to miss all this.
31IN,31IN_215,A,"Yeah, that’s right. I think boards that can do that is important. We’ve seen small examples over time but I think for that to become more commonplace. We have boards of global companies where everybody is based in Melbourne, because that’s the circle or the narrow look around participants, and I think for those boards you [unclear] 01:00:19 for 10 years and say, “You should actually have representation from some of the geographies you’re a part of or more relevant backgrounds.” A much expanded director pool I think would be really beneficial too."
31IN,31IN_216,Q,"And the same, do you think – digital technology allows us to, we can be in this room and we could be speaking to people anywhere, so board meetings could be in a virtual space. Not just the inclusivity, those communication skills or whatever but we’ve got different communication technologies. Could that -"
31IN,31IN_217,A,"I think that is being used by quite a few because one other challenge is just the role of boards in the US markets, four meetings a year, a lovely lunch and then sign off the accounts and you’re done."
31IN,31IN_218,Q,Really?
31IN,31IN_219,A,"That has been the background whereas here, far more involved in a major company in terms of the number of meetings you have to be in person, the committees, all of those other things. I think that will evolve. I guess in 10 years you would hope we have a far better sense of actually what makes boards tick. I mean I’ve talked about narrowly the gender diversity on boards and Credit Suisse’s work which showed that correlation. I guess more of a sense of the value of that diversity I think within those boards. I don’t know if we’ll be able to quantitatively prove every factor and its influence but certainly a better sense of –"
31IN,31IN_22,A,"Some of our members are offshore too so we have members in the UK, Netherlands and US."
31IN,31IN_220,Q,That works.
31IN,31IN_221,A,"Yeah, that’s right and more case studies of really high-performing companies and boards and also, what about the narrow companies or the values? What prompted those? How did chair-CEO relationships or narrow thinking on the board contribute to those? It’s certainly been a hallmark I think in some of the issues in the past but I think in 10 years hopefully we’d have a much better indicator of those."
31IN,31IN_222,Q,"Of that dynamic, what contributed to it and [unclear] 01:02:52."
31IN,31IN_223,A,"Yeah. I think an important catalyst over recent years too is just a better understanding from investors of the boards they appoint. I think we’ll see that change and an increase in engagement and probably an increase – or we’ve seen this with large companies where investors actually meet the entire board in various forms because often it’s just the chair who will go out or the remuneration committee chair. We’re going to change remuneration. Let’s do a road show. I think that’s evolving as well. So it’s interesting, the changes, people from names on a page to here are the people we’re asked to elect and so on."
31IN,31IN_224,A,"One thing ACSI’s floated recently in their policy area, one on gender, the 40/40/20 goal is there on gender. The other is annual director elections and one of the reasons we’ve put for that is that actually in the UK where they’ve had annual election for eight years, it’s changed some of the dynamic there where if there are concerns over individual directors or lack of engagement or issues with financial reporting or whatever they may be, actually directors are voted on annually so there’s more of a feedback mechanism. In Australia, the average voting for ASX 200 directors are 96%. There are some anomalies. So you have two of the AMP board voted off the board last year by a majority of investors but those are rare occurrences. It’s something where potentially more accountability via the vote over time as they have in the UK. That’s one of our focus areas."
31IN,31IN_225,A,"But the other side is with annual elections it’s actually been an important step for a lot of boards in their own self-evaluation because here, you have the three-year election cycle so we know it’s very hard to remove a board member. It basically cannot be done unless they resign. Often boards may really evaluate somebody’s performance when they’re up for election in front of shareholders and that happens on a three-year cycle. There’s often a feeling, I have three three-year cycles. I can serve 10 years. Is this comfortable? Potentially or in some companies whereas in the UK, the feedback we’ve had from boards and investors over there is the annual cycle makes it that a bit more, the review more significant so actually each year you’re assessing the board’s performance. You’re doing the 360 where you’re thinking how is everyone adding value and so on, rather than waiting three years until an individual –"
31IN,31IN_226,Q,Can we change that here?
31IN,31IN_227,A,"Yeah. It can be changed. Over there it’s the effect – it’s a bit like the corporate governance principles over there. It’s a voluntary adoption around annual elections and basically the FTSE, almost every company in the FTSE 250 have annual elections. It hasn’t made boards more short term or hasn’t been spilling boards willy-nilly but it certainly has tightened up that accountability side."
31IN,31IN_228,Q,"That’s something that could be done as a regulatory thing but once again, industry, it’s not government. Is there anything that government can do or is it hands off?"
31IN,31IN_229,A,That may be influenced by government in Australia because while the ASX is obviously not a function of –
31IN,31IN_23,Q,This research is focused on Australia so any questions I ask will be focused on the influence. The first question is how does your organisation influence Australian boards?
31IN,31IN_230,Q,Government.
31IN,31IN_231,A,"Yeah, government. I mean one thing that’s sometimes discussed is director’s duty. Does it need to be more broadly cast as it is in the UK to get that more well-rounded?"
31IN,31IN_232,Q,That’s in the corporations? What does that mean?
31IN,31IN_233,A,"Over there the companies actually say, “You have duties to the company but you should have due regard to the long-term impacts of a decision, its impact on employees, its impact on the environment” and spell out the considerations."
31IN,31IN_234,Q,All the stakeholders.
31IN,31IN_235,A,"There have been no test cases as to you didn’t do due regard to x, y or z whereas here it’s best interest of the company, duty of care, skill and diligence. I think the argument is really or that a lot of Australian directors say as well, we do take that into consideration. It’s a bit like the current debate around climate change and the Hartley opinion. This is a foreseeable risk therefore it’s within a director’s standard duty. I think that will evolve too. It doesn’t go directly to diversity but it’s clearly one of the things that do matter."
31IN,31IN_236,Q,That was great. You’ve brought lots of different things.
31IN,31IN_237,A,"If there’s anything that occurs after or we missed or whatever else, feel free to pick up the phone."
31IN,31IN_24,A,"I guess to the background I’m talking about, ACSI was founded in 2001. We’re an association working for those superannuation fund and asset owner members. The reason that the organisation was set up is as funds became larger and larger investors, particularly in western companies, they came to realise that the kind of governance or ESG risk in those companies were shared across a group. If you take a long-term investor perspective, you may be invested in BHP or CBH today, you’ll be invested in 10, in 20, in 30 years’ time so sort of governance and other issues in those companies is really relevant. At the time or shortly after we had the cases, for instance HIH –"
31IN,31IN_25,Q,That’s right. It’s right at that time.
31IN,31IN_26,A,"Yeah, that’s right. I think all of those things about, what questions are we asking the companies we are investing in or the regulators and so on within markets? Are we simply just putting our money out and hoping for the best or can we engage influence and so on? So ACSI was formed and really I think our core function is to do three things. One is ESG research to –"
31IN,31IN_27,Q,ESG?
31IN,31IN_28,A,"Environmental, social and corporate governance. Sorry, many, many acronyms."
31IN,31IN_29,Q,It’s good.
31IN,31IN_3,Q,I didn’t –
31IN,31IN_30,A,"It was very much governance in the early days too and it sort of built out but really the material risks or issues within those areas so research to discover them but then where they relate to individual companies. Actually they’re mandated and engaged with those boards and have a discussion and conversation, influence who you need to where there are concerns and where the issues at the regulatory level, actually to engage with the regulators or the ASX or policymakers. There could be shareholder rights issues or takeovers regime or disclosures around, and diversity is one of those. We’ve been a long-term member of the ASX Corporate Governance Council so we see influence and those regulatory settings is really important. Sometimes it’s just more efficient than convincing companies one by one to do something."
31IN,31IN_31,Q,"Yeah, exactly."
31IN,31IN_32,A,System of disclosure or requirements.
31IN,31IN_33,Q,Have you had any influence in the ASX principles that came out recently?
31IN,31IN_34,A,"Yeah. All council members do but we’ve always been a supporter of those and participant on that council, right from the beginning actually. Taking the gender diversity issue, I think now there’s a much better consensus in these things. If I think about 10 years ago we were not just in that forum but I think broadly, why are you talking about this? I know there’s a huge debate or fight within the ASX Corporate Governance Council, those first round of disclosures around setting targets, disclosing board level diversity. It wasn’t universally supported."
31IN,31IN_35,Q,"It was sort of saying, diversity? What’s that?"
31IN,31IN_36,A,"Yeah, that’s right or why are you being prescriptive about this? There’s all sorts of diversity. Why are we only looking at gender and so on? I think our point has always been, there’s certainly a broader conversation but at the time it was quite an observable factor. We had 50% of the director talent pool unrepresented [unclear] 00:06:18 accounting for about 9% of the seats, and the numbers were going backwards so it was like, let’s start here. We can have the conversation about broader inputs about the places we’re obviously lacking. That became more popular as time went on."
31IN,31IN_37,Q,"Yeah, but it was initially a shock. Like 10 years ago it was – and a shock so what are we talking, 2009?"
31IN,31IN_38,A,"Yeah, and I think even when we challenge companies or boards on the issue at that point, I think they’ll say, “We can’t find women in our industry,” all those hackneyed lines. Where I think the move has gone is that now with the 30% Club and other, and through years of engagement and so on, actually boards now talk to us proactively. So they know our view on the issue. They’ll actually say, “Here’s what we’re doing to address the issue. We’re thinking of our next appointment” and so on. You don’t even have to raise it. It’s become the norm and why wouldn’t I subscribe to the norm as opposed to an issue from outside?"
31IN,31IN_39,Q,"That’s nice, soft governance. I’ve got so many questions. I don’t know if I’m –"
31IN,31IN_4,A,Or in some discussions or something.
31IN,31IN_40,A,"No, that’s all right. We can follow up."
31IN,31IN_41,Q,Do you help them find people for their boards?
31IN,31IN_42,A,"No. We do occasionally actually. They’ll send us out about views and people. We’ve done longitudinal research over some time about the challenges around – I can remember again if you wind back 10 years, between 80% and 90% of appointments to ASX 100 boards were already directors of other ASX 100 boards so you had quite a narrow gene pool. I think part of the gender diversity story is actually the story of boards looking broadly and saying, “What skills do we need to bring? How do we broaden the talent pool? How do we get relevant skills or directors with relevant experience that we’ll add to our boards?” Because prior to that I think it was very much, I know –"
31IN,31IN_43,Q,Mateship.
31IN,31IN_44,A,"Yeah, that mateship or [unclear] 00:08:39. I always make this sort of joke. They were serious. Some boards will say, “We have diversity. We have Melbourne and Sydney on this board.” They were serious, without batting an eyelid and you try not to laugh but that’s how people viewed it. I also think that time when people were reappointed to the board they might have a short bio or CV and you think, how does this relate to the company they’re joining? Whereas now, a lot of director appointments is, we’ve actually been looking for someone with mining and geology experience because of all – health with the corporate strategy which is x or someone with North American experience because this is how the company is expanding. It’s actually matching the person to the needs of the company [unclear] 00:09:30 as well. This person is a former accountant or a lawyer role, CEO."
31IN,31IN_45,Q,"Very experienced. That level of detail of board recruitment, member recruitment they show you that, do they, so that they’re doing this?"
31IN,31IN_46,A,"Yeah. We ask questions about this. Particularly on renewal they’re thinking about skills, diversity, all of these factors. We like to talk about it, not only what appointments have you made, but what are you planning to do? Are there school gaps, and looking at those. You’ve had those experiences over time – in Fairfax, where I had a board with no media experience. Rio Tinto had no mining experience for a certain time, and you think, how does this happen?"
31IN,31IN_47,Q,"It’s sort of a joke, isn’t it?"
31IN,31IN_48,A,Yeah.
31IN,31IN_49,Q,That’s amazing.
31IN,31IN_5,Q,"Yeah, I was there."
31IN,31IN_50,A,"So again, as a major investor – or ACSI members now own at least 10% of most ASX 200 companies, so they have a huge stake in the success of these businesses. So for us it’s about, are the best people being put forward? Are boards looking at a broad range of talents?"
31IN,31IN_51,Q,"I’m just thinking interference, how do you – the market doesn’t like regulation. Potentially you’re aware of people’s strategies so that you could be aware of the strategies of competitors?"
31IN,31IN_52,A,"Yeah. Although I think we’re careful in our discussions and I think boards – we deal with ASX 300 so we don’t deal with tiny companies or less-polished companies. I think we’re pretty clear about, here’s our strategic direction or here’s our thinking about board appointments and so on. We’ve never had issues around material or sensitive information. I mean, one we don’t share one response of one company with another and so on but even there, inside information, all those sorts of things we’ve never had issues there because I think people are pretty careful about what they say to investors. I think if a company is thinking about, we’d actually like to increase our gender diversity at our next director appointment or that we’d like more IT experience or someone with a background in this, ideally at our next board appointment, I don’t think, wouldn’t categorise that as market moving or sensitive side."
31IN,31IN_53,Q,"Yeah, exactly."
31IN,31IN_54,A,"But there’s a really rich discussion and I think it’s an area where, and again through the broader governance lens where superannuation funds fund managers and others actually take a lot of value from those conversations, even if it’s just to actually assess, well, we’ve met the CEO of the company and we’ve been to the strategy day and others but it’s interesting just to get the boards’ perspectives on those issues. Does one match the other? Does the board have the skill or the appropriate oversight? I think in some ways the governance and I guess to the 10-year piece as well, the governance discussion has changed so rather than the nice checklist and check the box, are you independent? Yeah, whatever the narrow side is and they’re fine. I think it’s becoming a far more rich discussion. It’s actually, think about the company strategy, its performance, its P&L, all of those broader disclosures, as well as, how are these people interacting or how does the governance framework actually support the board’s oversight role, things like they were hiring and firing CEOs on succession and those things. Are they equally important as other factors like remuneration? They’re more important actually but remuneration is an outworking of some of those strategic issues as opposed to an academic consideration on the side."
31IN,31IN_55,Q,"But would you have an interest in, I’m just looking at the media report, the very large remuneration for some of the chair of boards and stuff like that?"
31IN,31IN_56,A,"Yeah. I think that [unclear] 00:14:22 famous words around governance, culture and remuneration march together and a lot of those observations. I think another one that was close to our heart and we’ve certainly seen for some time is that there’s actually alignment between investor interests, customers and other employees and other stakeholders over time. Companies actually do well on those factors."
31IN,31IN_57,Q,Factors do well overall.
31IN,31IN_58,A,Yeah. You can’t succeed long term if you’re undermining customers or you’re not dealing properly with regulators. We don’t see a huge separation of interest there.
31IN,31IN_59,Q,You have very much a stakeholder model view of the organisation.
31IN,31IN_6,A,"I did leave early, so I didn’t have time to –"
31IN,31IN_60,A,"Most companies do. Most switched-on directors do. I think they’re licensed to operate in those things in their front of mind, kind of do it for me."
31IN,31IN_61,Q,That’s a good overview.
31IN,31IN_62,A,"One thing I should mention also we do, do, we have a set of guidelines for western companies which we update and feedback from our members, as well as, external bodies and other stakeholders over time. But we use those and we actually make voting recommendations to our members using those guidelines so part of closing the loop between engagement and research and interactions of companies so there’d be a reference point."
31IN,31IN_63,Q,You’re influencing all investors in potentially –
31IN,31IN_64,A,"Yeah, or our members."
31IN,31IN_65,Q,"Your superannuation members, not all shareholders?"
31IN,31IN_66,A,No.
31IN,31IN_67,Q,"Good. You’re very influential, aren’t you? I’d say so, 10%."
31IN,31IN_68,A,"Yeah. I think part of that is the understanding on the company in our side of, we’re here for the long term so UniSuper member or AustralianSuper member. Actually the success of this company over the long term will have a direct bearing on their members’ retirement savings. Therefore, if we think about the alignment of incentives or long-term value creation and all the strategy, actually that’s key to that success. So in that way, we’ve developed really strong relationships with a lot of companies. We get very good access. We probably meet over, today it’s 180 boards per year across the team to discuss these issues."
31IN,31IN_69,A,"Again now, and I think gender diversity is a good example but more broadly we actually have companies approaching us quite often. So we’ll have issues of concern or other meetings we’ll contact companies about but actually they approach us and say, “We’re planning changes to the board or we’re thinking about changing our remuneration. What do you think about issue A or B? It’s become a two-way –"
31IN,31IN_7,Q,"To be honest, I left after the toast, because I was there early."
31IN,31IN_70,Q,It’s a dialogue.
31IN,31IN_71,A,Dialogue whereas in the early days I think some companies are across it but it wasn’t as common.
31IN,31IN_72,Q,This is really nice. We’ll go to the importance. How important do you think it is to have a diverse board? 10 is extremely and 1 is not at all and then we’ll work from there.
31IN,31IN_73,A,I’m biased but I’ll say 10.
31IN,31IN_74,Q,"I already know your answer to this. You feel that it hasn’t always been that important. What do you feel has led to the change and importance? Because you said 10 years ago people didn’t even know what diversity was, let alone –"
31IN,31IN_75,A,Are we talking gender diversity or more broadly?
31IN,31IN_76,Q,We will define that so however you want to define it.
31IN,31IN_77,A,"I think in both ways, I mean there’s so much in the – there’s a lot of actually research and I think the 30% Club in the UK know those references when they first started. There’s so much in the psychology world and group dynamics that for instance when you have – I forget the name of the study now. I should have done my background before this, where they use, they do tests of groups of male and female students against one another and then they use mixed groups in this huge study they did. They found that mixed groups performed better overall. I obviously don’t why."
31IN,31IN_78,A,"But I think the issues around groupthink are really important. People think of groupthink as a whole bunch of people agreeing with one another but actually digging into the background in the behavioural psychology research, it’s more about, if you have people, all have the same background, experience, learning, they’re not agreeing with one another but they will all independently to a view on an issue. But because there’s that following the same pathway or same set of experiences actually that is a major input into that groupthink situation."
31IN,31IN_79,A,"On the gender front I think things like the Credit Suisse’s global, it’s called the Global 3000 where they actually looked at a huge suite of companies and they said, “How can we compare companies with gender -diverse boards and gender-diverse management?” and surprise, surprise, there was a correlation between higher financial returns over time, lower risk, lower gearing and so on. Again you can’t point to the whys of that but that’s the quantitative aspect. I would say the qualitative aspect, and we’ve heard this from a lot of chairmen, male chairman and people who had been part of all-male companies and so on, actually said, you just change the discussion so the more views you can have around the table, the more you break out of that potential groupthink."
31IN,31IN_8,A,That’s right.
31IN,31IN_80,A,"I think also that sort of diversity of experience, background, people have seen the same issues but maybe in different industries or different arenas that the qualitative aspect is actually, that’s beneficial. I think many more of them are thinking a lot more around skills, backgrounds, even age, diversity and so on because you’ll get those differences there. There’s all of those and it’s a much richer discussion. But also mindful with that as an investor analysis, coming from the outside looking in, you cannot use a template and say, do they have one lawyer, one accountant, whatever it may be, check, check, check. That board is fine. You are dealing with people and group dynamic so you need something more than that."
31IN,31IN_81,Q,"But you would be worried if a board of a large company didn’t have a lawyer or an accountant on it, would you?"
31IN,31IN_82,A,It depends. Boards often say we can hire lawyers as independent advisers so we can mooch that.
31IN,31IN_83,Q,I thought you’d always hire a lawyer.
31IN,31IN_84,A,"But I think different from the old world, and private equity firms used to do this when they’re lodging an IPO. They’ll say, “Here’s a great former politician and sports star” and some great names as opposed to, “Here are people with really relevant strong industry experience who will be able to guide, not micromanage but actually oversee and guide this company.”"
31IN,31IN_85,Q,[Unclear] 00:23:06.
31IN,31IN_86,A,"I think there’s also a much different attitude among directors today, again, as it’s been previously where people are actually interested and engaged with the boards that are joining so it’s less of a case of, I’ve retired from a great glowing career in corporate life. This is a transition to retirement. I’ll have a few good lunches and whatever else. I don’t really care about what’s happening in the company. I think now directors they do more due diligence with the companies they get involved in. They’re probably more across the detail and passionate about the institutions they’re a part of. They’ll have more skin in the game. Often they own more shares and so on. It’s becoming more and more I think professional."
31IN,31IN_87,Q,That’s been over the last 10 years?
31IN,31IN_88,A,"Yeah, I think so too."
31IN,31IN_89,Q,"It was a big shakeup wasn’t it, the global financial crisis and all that sort of stuff?"
31IN,31IN_9,Q,"I’ve just got a few demographic questions, your discipline background?"
31IN,31IN_90,A,Yeah.
31IN,31IN_91,Q,"There’s also the regulatory changes for boards too like liability, the liability insurance and that."
31IN,31IN_92,A,"The AICD every now and again comes out and says liability is too high but I think if you look at the extremely small number of directors pursued by ASIC and the circumstances around the Centro or James Hardie or other cases, I actually think one, they’re not unfair issues to pursue and it’s a very tiny list of people who have been found wanting or faced really penalties in those situations. Again I don’t see any – the other day at the 30% Club launch I think it’s all still more people wanting to join boards."
31IN,31IN_93,Q,People aren’t running away.
31IN,31IN_94,A,"No, absolutely."
31IN,31IN_95,Q,Like the doctors in New South Wales when the medical internship –
31IN,31IN_96,A,"One tangible and coming from a legal background, I think we need to focus a lot on Section 180 and the base level requirements of director’s duties. I think the interesting thing in the governance consideration and where investors look at is actually, how do we appoint and promote really high-quality, high-functioning boards? Above and beyond, have we met our very base level legal requirement or actually how they add value to the organisations and how do you have top-quality people? Which is very different so I think the legal thinking is how do I meet bare minimum and avoid liability or –"
31IN,31IN_97,Q,Compliance first.
31IN,31IN_98,A,"Yeah, that’s right."
31IN,31IN_99,Q,"Stretching, adding value."
32D,32D_1,Q,"Okay.  So, thanks 32D for agreeing to be interviewed about board diversity.  We're interested in, like, there's a lot of talk about board diversity, but we're interested in the perceptions of people who are actually on boards like yourself.  We also are interviewing institutions that influence your performance; you know, what you do on boards here in Australia.  So, we really need people like you to come and talk so thank you so much."
32D,32D_10,A,And am currently on four.
32D,32D_100,Q,Do you feel that it’s always been important?  Has it always been the case?
32D,32D_101,A,"Yeah, I do.  Because I mean the main reasons, I think is avoiding groupthink.  I mean, I start to worry when everyone’s nodding and agreeing.  In fact, there are some people certainly the board that I’m president on, that I’ve been on the longest.  You know, there’s a couple of people on that board that are quite quiet in meeting but every time I speak, they go, “Look, playing devil’s advocate.”  And I go, “Oh, good, I knew you were going to come up with that.  That’s good.”  Challenging each other I think is really important, not just comfortably, as I said being a chair warmer and just going along, you know, for the ride.  That is not making the contribution and it’s not adding value to the organisation.  So, I think it’s very important to have people who have another point of view."
32D,32D_102,Q,"So, we could – so cognitive diversity then.  Would you think that might be the term?"
32D,32D_103,A,"Yeah maybe, I don’t know whether it’s cognitive but just a different lens, a different perspective who have the ability to look at it different ways.  I mean, even in my executive career running teams, if people just kept agreeing with me it would come up in their performance review and go look, I know I’m fabulous but if you just keep agreeing – like if we all agree with each other, then all but one of us might as well go home because we’re not actually adding to make the work better if we’re all just going, “Yeah, that’s fine, that’s fine, that’s fine.”  So, I absolutely encourage people to say what they think and I they don’t agree with me even better."
32D,32D_104,Q,Do you think that there’s any – I’m going to come back to that because I think you’re going to help me a lot there.
32D,32D_105,A,"Oh, good."
32D,32D_106,Q,"Do you think that there is any situation or context that might cause you to change that rating, like high risk, high uncertainty?"
32D,32D_107,A,The rating of 10?
32D,32D_108,Q,Yes.
32D,32D_109,A,"Look, I can see why for example on the boards that I sit on, I don’t think so.  But on ASX boards, this is just what I’ve gleaned from talking to recruiters as well, is they point – I don’t know whether I mentioned this to you the other day.  But as one of them quoted out to me, you know, people like me are actually a risk to them because unless I’m known by – you know how it’s all that, there’s a bit of a perception or a reality that it’s always people who are known that get appointed to those boards.  One of the recruiters said to me, as in the case that we had, “You appoint a CEO, it doesn’t work out, you can fire them, or you can move them on.”  If you appoint a director who turns out just to be a complete pain in the butt and just disruptive, not collaborative, a road blocker, continually just being disruptive, it’s very hard to get rid of them."
32D,32D_11,Q,"So, you’re currently on four and you've had five?"
32D,32D_110,A,"So, when I say, “What would change my mind.”  I guess probably nothing but getting the right amount of diversity for the right reasons, again for the right skills is I guess what I’m talking about.  Not diversity for diversity sake.  I have seen that as well.  On the national board, there was a young nominated member, like quite young compared – I mean, like most people are at least over 50, only a couple in their late 40s."
32D,32D_111,Q,Okay.
32D,32D_112,A,"Or older.  And there was a young guy of indigenous heritage who was on that board and although he was a nice guy, he said absolutely nothing and so I’m sure the board felt very proud of itself that they had somebody who was both indigenous and young.  But made no contribution, so I don’t see the point of that."
32D,32D_113,Q,"We’ll come back to that as well.  I just want to get through those questions before I want you to really drill down on this.  So, this is the – So, the right amount of diversity at the right time.  Is that right?"
32D,32D_114,A,"Well, just as I’m saying, like, diversity to me is different opinions different lens, different skills.  But you wouldn’t just go, “Oh they’ve worked at the zoo let’s get them in because we don’t have anybody on this board who worked at the zoo.”  Even though it’s completely irrelevant, that would tick the diversity box.  But it doesn’t necessarily, it’s not necessarily what the organisation needs."
32D,32D_115,Q,"Yeah, so that does link to strategy, mission?"
32D,32D_116,A,I think the board composition needs to be very strategic.
32D,32D_117,Q,"So, it needs to link, so that -"
32D,32D_118,A,Yeah and there also needs -
32D,32D_119,Q,-@ appropriateness is linked.
32D,32D_12,A,I was on the board of Clemenger BBDO Melbourne which was the last agency I worked at before I started my own.
32D,32D_120,A,"Yeah.  There also needs to be a culture within the board and that’s also really important and that’s where I think in a bygone era white middle-aged men felt very comfortable in the company of other white middle-aged men.  So that was a very easy choice.  But sometimes that just turned into homogenous thinking, whereas I think we need to be getting different thinking into challenge.  Because things are changing so quickly."
32D,32D_121,Q,"Now there's one question before we move into that because this is really where all your stuff's really heading on the functioning on the board and culture, and I want to explore that in-depth.  But before we do, can we just say, is there a particular kind of diversity that you think matters more than others or is really contingent?"
32D,32D_122,A,"I would say being able to bring a different lens to the organisation and its strategy, its strategic direction.  I mean, when I'm saying a different lens, so some people's lens might be financial or operational or someone might be more about creative thinking.  I think they're the important to me, the main ones.  And that's why someone who's much younger might have a whole lot of ideas around where to take the organisation because they're more, you know, they're digital natives and they know here are some things that you old codgers might not have thought about.  So, to me, it's having those different lenses of how to drive the business forward."
32D,32D_123,Q,"Great.  So now, you've been talking about culture, the culture of the board, developing the culture of the board and bringing in voices, say the Aboriginal didn’t contribute his voice and that was a problem.  He had potentially a very useful different lens but didn’t bring it to the table.  So, is there a connection between how you might develop the culture of the board, perhaps the one that you’re chair of and the different voices, potential voices you have around the table.  So actually, harnessing the difference."
32D,32D_124,A,"Yes.  So, I mean in my role as president when I’m chairing board meetings I deliberately, if anyone goes quiet I will deliberately single them out and ask them what they think.  But normally it’s quite systematic particularly if we’re dealing with something that’s, you know, we’ve had a paper distributed.  If it’s relatively, not controversial, but something that I imagine people will have a firm opinion on.  And this is more the - less the reporting because I just go that's a rear vision mirror, that’s what happened last week, let’s worry about where we’re going.  I will deliberately go around all directors and seek their input."
32D,32D_125,A,"In the case of that board where we had the indigenous guy, the chair would ask him his opinion and he would just go, “Yeah, I’m fine with that.”  So, I mean it’s not that he – I certainly am not suggesting that the environment created on that board didn’t invite comment and it’s always asked of people.  It’s just that individual chose or didn’t feel comfortable or didn’t have the experience, I don’t know what it was, but anyway."
32D,32D_126,Q,"So, I guess this term inclusiveness has come up and the ability of the board to cultivate inclusiveness is important.  So, I guess I’m wondering if you have some ideas about how this might be done?  Because it seems to be important for us to develop, to benefit."
32D,32D_127,A,It’s extremely important.
32D,32D_128,Q,"Yeah, so can we talk that?"
32D,32D_129,A,"How do we foster inclusion?  Well, I think it's; this is only my own style.  So, I'm not speaking of anything."
32D,32D_13,Q,"Great.  So, you've been doing this over how many years was it?"
32D,32D_130,Q,You don’t have any universal.
32D,32D_131,A,"For me, it’s validating what people are contributing, whether that’s the direction it takes or not.  So even this morning I was chairing the Victorian disability awards panel where we had to decide who’s going to get these awards and whatever.  But it was really important to me.  If somebody makes a comment, even if I don’t agree with it, it doesn’t mean it’s not valid and we shouldn’t consider it and talk about it.  So, I think creating that environment which I try and do, as I said on my board is make sure everyone is heard and to absolutely validate what everyone says.  Sometimes someone will something, I think oh gee, I’m not sure about that.  In which case I will say to the whole board, “Gee, what do you think?”  And get more discussion around that."
32D,32D_132,A,"So that to me, you need to sometimes encourage people to put forward their opinion.  Always have an atmosphere of not shutting people down and particularly if it’s not in agreement with what you’re saying and validating everyone’s point of view, so they feel – it’s almost like small children isn’t it, you’ve just got to encourage that kind of behaviour, so they repeat it.  So, to me, that's very important."
32D,32D_133,Q,"I heard one person told me that they were in a meeting and someone was really quite a bit offensive in what they said and how they said it, and so they weren’t the chair and they were a fairly new person to this board and they told this person it was completely inappropriate and that they should leave."
32D,32D_134,A,How did that end?
32D,32D_135,Q,"Oh, it ended well, because that person actually wasn’t a board member I think, they were part of a legacy that they would sit on the board, but they were actually not separate.  So, it helped to sort of keep a separation.  A distance, yeah.  But that was a very brave move of this person I thought."
32D,32D_136,A,Yes.
32D,32D_137,Q,"But possibly a very necessary one, because then like he felt there were no, you know, that no-one took it out on him."
32D,32D_138,A,There were no repercussions for bad behaviour.
32D,32D_139,Q,"Yeah, no-one thought he was, yeah, bad or inappropriate or anything."
32D,32D_14,A,"Oh, gosh.  Now that's a -"
32D,32D_140,A,"Yeah.  I think that is very important to call out bad behaviour.  One of the things that has struck me unbelievably about all four boards that I’m currently on is the degree of professionalism.  In fact, conflict that I mentioned earlier that’s going on, I kept saying to everyone involved in that, that I think it’s absolutely - there’s a lack of professionalism and there’s a lack of respect that is contributing to that conflict.  I said, “Yes, there is some lack of alignment, but adding fuel to this fire, we need to be trying as grow-ups to defuse this situation and find, you know, discuss it reasonably, find a resolution to move forward.  Not just to just vent and complain and everything else.”  I don’t find that constructive at all."
32D,32D_141,A,"I think maybe for me; my background is advertising was as client service.  Which I didn’t realise until just the last couple of years, I think the skills that I learnt in client service can put me in very good stead to be on the board because I need to convince my client, the person who’s paying the money for us to provide a service to make a decision to get everyone in agreement so we can move forward.  But in a very polite and respectable way, because they could fire me.  I think it’s absolutely essential to maintain that professionalism.  And if people speak out of people aren’t right - in fact, I’m coaching a business owner at the moment, we’re talking about their culture and I said, “Poor behaviour needs to be called out at the right time and in the appropriate manner.”"
32D,32D_142,A,"So, you don’t shoot someone down in front of everybody else, it’s just afterwards you go, “Look, I just don’t think that was quite the right way to go about that.”  But just keep calling it out so it changes."
32D,32D_143,Q,"Okay.  So, do you think selection plays a role in this?"
32D,32D_144,A,As in the people that you put on a board?
32D,32D_145,Q,"Yeah, selection of candidates."
32D,32D_146,A,"Yeah, totally."
32D,32D_147,Q,So how would you screen for this?
32D,32D_148,A,"It’s kind of for me it’s a little intuitive.  The CEO that we appointed that turned out to not be so good, there was a cultural is32D and we did have to be very brave.  So, I actually was the one who, I was approached by several people within a matter of weeks and my mind went from having to have a bit of a chat to maybe he needs some executive coaching, to you have to go.  So, gathered the board, we had an extraordinary board meeting, met with the lawyers and just made that decision because that couldn’t go on.  What I have learnt from that Margo, is that even though that person came to us through a recruiter and we had them psychometric tested and they had to do the presentation on the first 100 days and all that kind of stuff.  I just said to the recruiter, “Just something, my intuition is telling me there’s something not quite right here, I just feel we’re missing something.”"
32D,32D_149,Q,Isn’t that interesting.
32D,32D_15,Q,Boards.
32D,32D_150,A,"Yeah.  So, my big lesson from that is if my intuition is telling me something’s not right, chances are something’s not right.  So, I don’t whether that’s – that’s probably a real bad answer to go I just use my intuition."
32D,32D_151,Q,"No.  No, there are no bad answers, I mean that sincerely."
32D,32D_152,A,"Well, you know, that’s one where you just, your female intuition kicks in, you go yeah, something just doesn’t feel right about this."
32D,32D_153,Q,"But you know what that says to me from a rational point of view?  That says our tools and instruments don’t capture something that’s meaningful and significant.  So, we need tools, if we want to move down that sort of, you know, measuring path.  But until then, we have to listen to hunches or whatever.  And it also says that outsourcing to head-hunters or search agencies or whatever is not the – you can’t sort of give all the responsibility to them."
32D,32D_154,A,"No, I did the next one.  I read all 64 applications for the next round and we did it ourselves internally.  I went, I am not using a recruiter; I’m not paying money.  I didn’t even appoint that recruiter, the outgoing CEO, the old one, original one said, “I’ve appointed these recruiters and we’ll manage the process and blah, blah, blah.”  And then she left and on we went.  So, after that I just went yeah, I feel too much of a sense of responsibility."
32D,32D_155,Q,"It’s too hard to work with conflict between the chairperson and the CEO, that must be terrible."
32D,32D_156,A,Yeah.  Feel like we’ve got a great one now.
32D,32D_157,Q,"Yeah.  Oh, isn’t that wonderful?  So, have you got – some people have come up with some – I like this question because it gives you a - is there an example that you can think of where diversity really helped make a decision or something on the board?"
32D,32D_158,A,"Well, I’m coming back again to diversity of opinion."
32D,32D_159,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
32D,32D_16,A,"Well five, six, seven, I guess the Clemenger Board, seven, eight, nine, was maybe nine years ago that I was on that one."
32D,32D_160,A,"Where, yes absolutely.  Not necessarily the right decision as it turns out."
32D,32D_161,Q,Doesn’t matter.
32D,32D_162,A,"But it certainly had an influence, because we had a situation in the merger that we were exploring, where one of the directors on the other organisation had been on a local council that had been stood down by the Minister for Local Government, pending investigation.  We’ve gone yeah, that’s a risk.  So, my opinion in that was, like, cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose immediately.  One of the other directors said, “Look, we haven’t got the findings of the investigation yet, this person could be a force for good, we’re just assuming that they’re a force for evil.”  Turns out they were, they’ve since been charged.  But that aside, I must admit I felt that I had been influenced in my opinion by my personal encounters with this person who is very un-professional basically, would just sum it up.  And I thought, not sure about this.  I would have just cut it loose."
32D,32D_163,A,"But it was interesting, and I was very pleased that that – I mean, still after all those meetings and everything else, it still stands out in my head that this person said, “Well we don’t actually know.  Like, we’re assuming that.”  There’s my intuition again going, I’m pretty sure she’s a force for evil.  But she said, “She could be a force for good.”  And I went, “Well, actually that’s true, I don’t know that.  So, let’s have another look.”"
32D,32D_164,Q,"So, was that person from a legal background that said that?"
32D,32D_165,A,"Yes.  She is and she’s a woman, she’s an academic and she’s great, but she’ll often do that.  She’ll pick the opposite side and that’s what I really enjoy about working with her."
32D,32D_166,Q,"Yeah and I mean, why I thought a legal background was because that’s a managing risks from a legal perspective, is to not attribute blame until they’re found guilty."
32D,32D_167,A,And now there’s plenty.
32D,32D_168,Q,"Yeah, but you’ve done the right thing."
32D,32D_169,A,"Actually, that’s a really interesting point because I did the company director’s course with another girl who was also, she’s not anymore, but she was on this board at the same time.  We had to do some role-playing and it was just so funny, the scenario they gave us, I’m like, “Wow, that’s great let’s charge on.”  And she’s gone, “Hang on a minute, we haven’t followed any process.”  And I looked at her and I’ve gone, “And we’re on the same board.”  Which again is where that diversity comes from."
32D,32D_17,Q,"Yeah, like 2010?"
32D,32D_170,A,"Because I’ve come from advertising, marketing, communications, it’s like don’t seek permission, seek forgiveness later.  Oh, we weren’t allowed to do that?  Oh, sorry.  Which is terribly different.  So, I'm much more in the case compared to a lot of other people on the boards, I'm much more risk ave – I'm not risk-averse.  I'm going, “Oh yeah, give it a crack, spend the money, why not.  This looks good to me, let’s give it a shot.”"
32D,32D_171,Q,Yeah and go for outcomes.
32D,32D_172,A,"Yeah exactly.  Whereas other they go, “Oh, you know, it looks a bit risky.”  And go, “Yeah, but the upside could be really good too.”  So that I thought was quite, that was a great illustration I thought of diversity of risk appetite."
32D,32D_173,Q,"Yeah, exactly.  And your lawyer example was really procedure versus look, my gut sense is this is bad let’s just cut it and the appropriate process is blah, blah, blah.  And you listened, like you heeded that."
32D,32D_174,A,"And it was the right thing to do actually.  I agreed with her because I thought - but then I sort of have to self-reflect which I like to think I do a lot of.  But when she goes out, I thought actually she’s right, I have no evidence to say, other than I just don’t really like her."
32D,32D_175,Q,You’ve got a good gut feel.
32D,32D_176,A,"As I said, she’s since been charged.  I think that’s evidence enough."
32D,32D_177,Q,"You could save a lot of juries.  So, do you think that there are some board functions where diversity of views has little bearing, it’s really irrelevant?"
32D,32D_178,A,"That's an interesting question.  Yeah, I think there are some situations and some circumstances that you might be in where you have got the lawyer or somebody who's, yeah not me, I'm not a lawyer.  Somebody who's saying, “Well my opinion on this is that.”  Like, I’m not going to go in and go, “Well I reckon.”  Like if that’s the law, so no diversity is required there as far as I’m concerned.  I may have a different opinion about the outcome or what we do with that information.  But it’s the same even with I do have an accounting qualification, but if the actual CFO says, “Well, , these are what we’re going to be doing for these reasons.”  I go, “Well, that makes sense.”  So, I think in those very operational reporting stuff there’s no need for diversity, it’s just these are the facts."
32D,32D_179,Q,Yeah.
32D,32D_18,A,"So, is it 2010?  Maybe it was around then.  So that would be about right."
32D,32D_180,A,"And they’re the experts in those areas and I think it’s appropriate to defer to – not necessarily their opinion, but their interpretation.  You go, “Okay, that’s your interpretation, now we can talk about that.”"
32D,32D_181,Q,"So expert technical information, it’s irrelevant, and so that might be your financial reporting."
32D,32D_182,A,"I’ve always got a lot of – it's not that people can't question it, I'm just saying that those people who are delivering the facts, I suppose if they are the facts then I don't think we need diversity.  What we do with those facts is absolutely where everyone should be weighing in."
32D,32D_183,Q,"But then as a board are these facts that’s the pre-reading, you said that they’re like the reports.  You know, that’s not what you focus on, you focus on right, now what are we going to do with this as a board."
32D,32D_184,A,"Oh, let me give you another example, I’m not explaining this very well."
32D,32D_185,Q,"Yeah, that’s all right."
32D,32D_186,A,"Let’s say I come up with some crazy wacky idea that we should be doing x and our legal person says, “Actually, that’s not legal, you can’t do that.”  Well that’s the end of the conversation, isn’t it?  It’s not open for discussion if she goes, “Yeah, no, not allowed to do that.” I go, “Okay, I believe you.”  That kind of thing."
32D,32D_187,Q,Okay.
32D,32D_188,A,"Or if I say, “Why can’t we just role that investment into something else?”  And the finance guy goes, “Well because - just again for example - well the caveats that are on that mean that we won’t be able to access that money to.”  “Yeah, that’s not right, we’re done.  We’re not doing that.”"
32D,32D_189,Q,"So, you’re coming from left of field and you’re creating, like the board might create ideas, possible strategies, possible [overtalk] 00:41:15 but then there will be an expert opinion that basically closes down.  Any discussion beyond that is a waste of time."
32D,32D_19,Q,"So, since -"
32D,32D_190,A,Correct.
32D,32D_191,Q,"Because, oh it's illegal.  But that's still diversity, like the diversity brings up these possible futures and it's just, thank god you’ve got the lawyer who saves you all the trouble by saying, “Oh well, that’s illegal.”"
32D,32D_192,A,"I guess you’re right.  I guess what I think about with diversity of opinion that even though that person goes it’s illegal, but I could push on.  Yeah, well look never mind that, let’s discuss the law."
32D,32D_193,Q,Let’s just keep going.  Maybe we could get away with it.
32D,32D_194,A,"Yeah.  So, it’s more in that aspect, but you are right I suppose that is diversity as well."
32D,32D_195,Q,"Yeah, in terms of the structure of the board?"
32D,32D_196,A,Yes.
32D,32D_197,Q,"It’s not so much in the process of decision making but, in the structure, because you’ve got different perspectives.  What about can diversity limit or undermine the functioning of the board in particular?"
32D,32D_198,A,"As I said, only in those cases where again having a look at the composition of some of the ASX200 board.  As I said, a lot of them have one or two women on them and if that person also is of ethnic diversity, well there’s two boxes ticked.  Now, maybe I’m being and I’m sure I am being incredibly simplistic about that, but you’ve got to out sometimes and go, “Well are they actually the right people on that board or is that just a bit of box-ticking exercise?”"
32D,32D_199,Q,And this brings us -
32D,32D_2,A,My pleasure.
32D,32D_20,A,"But then I was on that one for maybe two years and then I didn’t get onto another board until maybe 2013 or something.  Might have had a year out, something like that anyway."
32D,32D_200,A,I don’t know.
32D,32D_201,Q,-@ over here to targets.
32D,32D_202,A,Right.
32D,32D_203,Q,"So, is this a side effect of using targets do you think, and quotas that it becomes a box-ticking?"
32D,32D_204,A,"I don’t know whether it’s targets or quotas.  In fact, I was absolutely fascinated by Louise Davidson, who said we’re actually asking our members to vote against incumbent directors who are up for re-election if they don’t have women on their board.  I mean, that is – I was just like, wow, that’s interesting.  Like, that’s incredibly powerful that the superannuation investors have over those boards that they can actually do that.  So yes, so I don’t know whether it’s quotas, but I’m not – sorry, let me back up.  I’m not saying that the women who are on those boards and with their ethnic diversity are not right, I just think well if the whole board had more diversity to it rather than just fiddling with the edges.  Do you know what I mean?"
32D,32D_205,Q,"If it was the decision-making diversity and the skills diversity and whatever, but if it was all grey."
32D,32D_206,A,"And if that were truly being embraced, that we want different opinions, different lens, creative thinking, how can we drive this business forward, then gender shouldn’t really be a problem, shouldn’t be an is32D, it shouldn’t even come into it."
32D,32D_207,Q,"Yeah.  That's right.  Because I mean, the 50% will be randomly distributed among these skills."
32D,32D_208,A,Exactly.  That’s right.
32D,32D_209,Q,"I thought it was interesting a person said they sort of, because it’s very visible the gender diversity of a board, they wouldn’t go onto a board that was gender diverse because they thought that was an indicator that to them that the board was too conservative.  They wouldn’t fit in with the culture of that board and they wouldn’t want to."
32D,32D_21,Q,Yeah.  But you've really been watching this space since around 2010.
32D,32D_210,A,Wow.
32D,32D_211,Q,Yeah.  Do you think there’s any – does that connect with you at all?
32D,32D_212,A,"I can see what – maybe it’s an individual personality type, as I said I’ve had to spend a lot of time dealing with clients of perhaps that ilk.  Like, I’ve worked on power tools.  I had one client who went, “We can’t have her on the account, we need a bloke, it’s power tools.”  They go, “No, you’ve got her.”  And of course, it worked out absolutely fine.  You know, that kind of thing, it wouldn’t concern me.  I think I would eventually manage to make my way and integrate.  Because, you know, as a client service person that’s what I have to do, or that’s what I’ve always done.  So, for me, no I think I would be prepared to give it a go."
32D,32D_213,Q,"Now I’m just thinking, you’re a female, he was male."
32D,32D_214,A,"Oh, really?"
32D,32D_215,Q,That said that.
32D,32D_216,A,He thinks that they’re too conservative if they have no gender diversity?
32D,32D_217,Q,Exactly.
32D,32D_218,A,"It just depends on the board too, because I would imagine if you were a Fin Tech for example, and the founders were blokes who had been to uni together or something and that was just there, then I can see again that might not be wrong at the start of that business to just be those people."
32D,32D_219,Q,Yeah.
32D,32D_22,A,"Oh, definitely.  Yeah."
32D,32D_220,A,"So, I don’t think, you know, forcing it sometimes just doesn’t feel right either."
32D,32D_221,Q,"Yeah.  So, you don’t see it as a signal at all?  That’s good.  You see it more as an opportunity to transform?"
32D,32D_222,A,Yes.
32D,32D_223,Q,"So, the conflict that can possibly arise with diversity, it’s interesting, I’ve had different – because I’m fairly well into the interviews now and I’ve had - the word conflict is very comfortable to some people.  Start-ups, males very comfortable it would seem, and I’ve got the very small sample size, so really, I shouldn’t generalise, but that has been the pattern.  But conflict, other people have said, “No, not conflict, it’s - .”  And they’ll have another word.  It’s debate or that’s good.  But conflicts bad, because they see conflict as like bullying."
32D,32D_224,A,"Yeah.  I guess it depends on again, having worked in communication.  When I have developed brand strategies, quite often we spent a lot of time discussing what we mean by certain words.  Because what I have discovered over my time in comms is that different people have different interpretations of words.  I know the dictionary says that’s what it means, but some people there’s a whole lot of baggage that can come with a particular word like conflict.  So, for some people conflict, I’m sure, conjures up thoughts of aggression and being adamant and inflexible and that’s conflict.  Whereas other people just interpret conflict as having a difference of opinions and working your way through it."
32D,32D_225,A,"So, I think it just depends on – I don't have an opinion on the word one way or the other.  But I would just imagine that for some people the word conflict immediately has a whole lot of aggression and negativity associated with it."
32D,32D_226,Q,"Well given that, what sort of conflict or disagreement is dysfunctional in a board, if any and what is functional?  Can you describe it for me with your greatness?"
32D,32D_227,A,"Oh yeah, totally.  Well again, from my days in advertising there’s plenty of conflict there, let me tell you.  Where I think it’s constructive and it’s good is if everyone is sticking to the topic, is professional and talking about what’s in the best interest of the work.  In those circumstances to me it’s always like that, it’s never personal.  Like, I’ve been in meetings where people have come out and gone, “Oh, that was shocking.”  I go, “No it wasn’t.”  I don’t care, it’s all about making the work better.  So, I think it’s a case of, you know, as I’ve often said in advertising, he or she with the best case and the best argument and the best reason to do whatever it is will win.  However, I have also been told that she who is more articulate has an advantage, by one client who might have been pointing a t me at the time."
32D,32D_228,A,"But anyway.  My partner would absolutely agree with that.  When I become destructive in that conflict, I think is exactly the situation I was describing in this federated one, is where it's unprofessional, it's overly emotional, it can become personal.  I mean, that’s just inappropriate behaviour.  But if you don’t agree, I mean that’s fine, you just need to keep working through it and saying, “So tell me more about that, why do you think that?  What do you think the outcomes are?  What are you concerned about?”  Can you see this working?”  I mean, it’s just having a conversation.  Be that conflict, debate, whatever you want to - discussion.  But I see that as the major role of the board, having that discussion and those different opinions.  As I said, if everyone agrees, only need one person there, don’t we?"
32D,32D_229,Q,"Well, that’s it.  That’s why I really want; and I thought you would be a perfect person.  I got a bit excited because you would be a perfect person, which you just really given a nice analysis of it."
32D,32D_23,Q,"That's brilliant.  And are the boards mainly of a particular industry like not-for-profit, for-profit, state-owned, big, small?"
32D,32D_230,A,Oh good.  I hope I haven’t discounted.
32D,32D_231,Q,"No, no.  To help unpack what we need in terms of, because the different lens of course bring different points of view to a discussion and when does difference become dysfunctional and you’ve really articulated it and people have used words like conflict or whatever to try and articulate it.  But you have described it, so thank you."
32D,32D_232,A,"Oh, you're most welcome.  Again, being in advertising for so many years, there were many occasions where I heard from – well, in fact, I was on some management teams as well, but, you know, swearing at people.  No, not okay people.  I mean, I don’t mind swearing I couldn’t care less, but actually swearing at somebody.  No, not okay.  That kind of behaviour I just go, “That’s not all right.”"
32D,32D_233,Q,"So, if that happened at a board meeting, would you say, “Look, now that’s not okay,”  straightaway, or would you wait?"
32D,32D_234,A,"I am quite good at being passive-aggressive as one of my kids would tell me.  But I was in a board meeting where I felt that one of the directors was becoming quite condescending and lecturing.  And I must admit, when he started off on another a rant, I said, “We’ve all read the papers thank you.”  When he was starting to lecture us again.  I think he got the gist.  And then afterwards I spoke to the president and I went, “You know what?  Not okay.”  But that’s probably the worst that – if I were in that situation, I just can’t see it on the boards that I’m on.  They’re all just so respectful.  And having come from advertising, where people do scream at each other and are highly inappropriate and probably would make it personal as well, I’m just finding it so refreshing."
32D,32D_235,Q,"So, you have high-risk tolerance and high conflict tolerance?"
32D,32D_236,A,"Oh, yeah.  Look, I’ve been yelled at by clients and screamed at by creative and all of the above.  So, to actually - I’m finding – in fact that was part of, not just that, but the calibre of the conversation in board rooms and the professionalism that’s exhibited, I find highly appealing.  That’s what I really enjoy."
32D,32D_237,Q,"That would be great.  That would be really good.  So, I’m conscious now of the time."
32D,32D_238,A,"That’s all right, as I said I’ve got -"
32D,32D_239,Q,I’ve really enjoyed this so much.
32D,32D_24,A,"I’m currently sitting on two not-for-profits, a start-up which is also actually a not-for-profit but it’s not, you know, it’s just so interesting isn’t it?  It’s not a straightforward not for profit, it’s setting up a special purpose vehicle that will be commercial that will generate money for charity."
32D,32D_240,A,"No, no, that’s okay.  And as I said, I’m not seeing Gerard until 2:30 but you probably have something else to be going too."
32D,32D_241,Q,I do have another interview to do.  You talked about that.
32D,32D_242,A,"Good, tick that one off."
32D,32D_243,Q,"So, when identifying potential new members, does your board consider ways to increase diversity as you prioritise it?"
32D,32D_244,A,"Look, to be perfectly frank because we’re unpaid not-for-profit board, when we did our last round we only had, we put out a call, I think we only had four people apply.  It makes it pretty slim pickings.  So that really has - and two of them were great and we appointed them, and one was from that gaming industry.  We’ve gone, “Yeah, no, I don’t think so, not for what we do.”  So yeah, not really.  Depends on what we get."
32D,32D_245,Q,"Okay yeah, so there’s a lack of supply really?"
32D,32D_246,A,"Yeah, really, a total lack of supply."
32D,32D_247,Q,"Do people outside the board influence this selection process?  Like you described, which was great, the use of a – the CEO used a – sorry, the previous chair used an outsourcing?"
32D,32D_248,A,That was to get the CEO.
32D,32D_249,Q,"To get the CEO.  So, with boards do you tend to outsource on some of your boards?"
32D,32D_25,Q,"Oh, okay."
32D,32D_250,A,"Well actually, let me just think about this for a moment.  So, the two that we’ve recently appointed to the one I’m president of we just ran the ads in the appropriate places, wrote the description, decided what we were looking for, that took longer than we thought actually, because we looked at our skills matrix and went why is some of these things even on here?  That doesn’t make any sense.  So that was quite a good exercise and we’re happy with those appointments."
32D,32D_251,A,"With the national board that I’m on, I was actually on the recruitment working committee.  See this is where this work thing keeps coming up.  We needed to appoint a new chair and a new independent director, and I think that might have come through a recruitment process or maybe they advertised, but on that working committee, we had a lot of applications for that one.  So as working team, we just had to work through them all and then we went back to the board.  So, it came down to three of us, pretty much.  And obviously with the executive as well, but it pretty much came down to a working group of three.  There was no-one external on that."
32D,32D_252,Q,"Okay, so you’re not big users, you haven’t been users of the external services?"
32D,32D_253,A,No.  Only probably because none of them have got much money.
32D,32D_254,Q,"Yeah.  Because they would cost a fair bit, wouldn’t they?"
32D,32D_255,A,"Well that’s the other thing too, I’ve been told by various people that appointing directors isn’t overly lucrative for recruiters compared to say sweet appointments.  So, they go, yeah, they’re not their first priority.  So even though I’ve been going around seeing 14 recruiters and trying to put myself forward for boards, I have been told it’s not their number one priority.  They almost do it like a favour to organisations who use them to appoint their executives."
32D,32D_256,Q,Right.
32D,32D_257,A,Because there’s no – the money is just not the same as for appointing a CEO or a CFO.
32D,32D_258,Q,That surprises me.  I assumed it would be more.
32D,32D_259,A,"Oh god no.  No, no, no, no."
32D,32D_26,A,"Yeah, that's quite an interesting one.  And I'm also on a state government-appointed board."
32D,32D_260,Q,Quite often [unclear] 00:56:21.
32D,32D_261,A,"Yeah and quite often too the board will have a couple of people in the wings and the board often starts with all right we need to get somebody, a recruiter, but who knows somebody, put them into the recruitment, into the mix as part of the process."
32D,32D_262,Q,"Gee, that’s a good point.  Okay, that's great.  Do the boards that you're familiar with have any barriers do you think that you're aware of to managing or building diversity?  Well, you've mentioned supply."
32D,32D_263,A,Other than supply.
32D,32D_264,Q,"Yeah, supply is really the is32D?"
32D,32D_265,A,"Well, accept that national one as I said, where they’re nominated appoint -"
32D,32D_266,Q,"Federation, yeah.  Federation nominations."
32D,32D_267,A,[unclear] 00:57:01.
32D,32D_268,Q,"Yeah, that’s a real formal network isn’t it?"
32D,32D_269,A,"Oh, it’s shocking.  Well, it's not really, that’s the problem it’s not formal enough in some ways.  But anyway."
32D,32D_27,Q,"They’re varied, aren’t they?  That's great."
32D,32D_270,Q,Oh.  It’s not accountable?
32D,32D_271,A,"No and there’s no formal arrangement between anybody, between the network and anyway – it’s terrible.  And hence we’re in conflict."
32D,32D_272,Q,"Yeah.  So, the conflict there can we go back to that then?"
32D,32D_273,A,Sure.
32D,32D_274,Q,That’s political is it?
32D,32D_275,A,Totally.
32D,32D_276,Q,Yeah.  It’s about who -
32D,32D_277,A,"Who’s controlling what.  Who has a say, who’s allowed to – if we want to look at the constitution, should everyone be involved?  Look, it’s just a nightmare, it is political.  I think it’s terribly political and a power play."
32D,32D_278,Q,"Okay.  So, there’s conflict but then there’s politics."
32D,32D_279,A,"In a federated organisation, there absolutely is at both the CEO and a board level."
32D,32D_28,A,"I like that.  Yeah, absolutely."
32D,32D_280,Q,"Right.  Do you think a state one where you’re appointed by ministers and various things, could there be conflict there do you think, due to politics?"
32D,32D_281,A,"I don’t know.  Well I have heard, and I don’t know whether this is true or not, but I have heard that I was appointed by the Labor Government and look my political persuasions are probably even further left than the Labor, so I don’t know that it had anything to do with that.  But I did hear from somebody that they like you to have done some unpaid director work before the will appoint you to a – so you look like the kind of person is happy to give back, without being paid.  Which I had before I got that appointment.  But after I got that appointment someone said to me, “Oh yeah, that makes sense, because they like people to have that.”  I don’t know whether that’s true or not, but yeah, I don’t know whether it’s – whereas maybe if the Liberal Party are in, maybe they don’t care about that.  Maybe they just go, “Mate, get in there, do a job.”  I don’t know.  I don’t have enough visibility."
32D,32D_282,Q,Experience of it.
32D,32D_283,A,"Or experience, yeah, it’s pretty opaque to me, that whole process, I don’t know how it works."
32D,32D_284,Q,"Yeah.  Okay, that’s good.  There’ll be someone else -"
32D,32D_285,A,"I had an advisor who told me that he had – I applied for within this panel, you know, the Get on Board website and an advisor said to me that they had actually put my name up to the minister for one of the positions.  So again, he told me that, so I don’t know.  I don’t know how it works."
32D,32D_286,Q,I have no idea.
32D,32D_287,A,How does that work?
32D,32D_288,Q,I interviewed someone who doesn’t even write a CV.
32D,32D_289,A,Oh really?
32D,32D_29,Q,"Yeah.  Brilliant.  So that would be really good if you could – and it’s also really good from a confidentiality is32D.  You're drawing from all these different ones it's really hard to pin the board or pin you, to be honest."
32D,32D_290,Q,"And doesn’t have a - yeah, so how do things work?  It’s amazing.  I’ll ask this question.  Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process, example between on the one hand trying to obtain a collegiate fit, let's imagine you have more choice than you do, and on the other trying to avoid groupthink?"
32D,32D_291,A,"Oh, totally.  I reckon totally.  I reckon a lot of boards are faced with that dilemma.  I reckon most of those boards trying to get women on their boards are facing that dilemma.  They go, “Yeah, they talk too much, they’re too opinionated.”  I mean at the 30%, I met a woman there who’s a lawyer and she was on the Chairs Mentoring Program and she said her mentor told her that the problem with female lawyers, which she is, they’re nit-pickers.  And I went, “What?”  And she goes, “Yeah, but good to know.”  Nit-picker.  So, I’m sure that – again, I’ve not actually been in that situation, I’m hypothesising, but I reckon a lot of them are going, “God, they’re not a member of the Melbourne Club or the Australia Club, how do we know that they’re all right.  They’re going to be a pain the arse.  High risk.”"
32D,32D_292,Q,High risk.
32D,32D_293,A,"“Yeah, we don’t them, where they come from.  Where have they come from?  What are they going to say?  Are they just going to irritate us?”  I think there’s a lot of that.  “They’ll just be annoying, they’ll be irritating, they’ll be asking too many questions.”  I’ve had one chair who’s on a coup - he’s on a lot of boards, who was telling me about a couple of women that were new to one of the boards he sits on.  He said, “Geez they’re asking a lot of questions, my modus operandi is no questions in the first two meetings, just listen.”  But I’m sure they’re desperate to be adding value and so – they were doing the head in of the rest of the board."
32D,32D_294,Q,That is so not how you describe things.  That’s a waste of space if someone’s just sitting there observing for two meetings.
32D,32D_295,A,"I would think so.  But I get that because when you have got new directors, you know, sometimes – and our meetings I always think we’re always a bit pressed for time.  You know, if you’ve got a new director asking things, okay, let’s take that offline.  Off-line, whatever that means.  Talk about it later because we’ve got to move on."
32D,32D_296,Q,"Yeah, okay.  From regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted?  You know, use of gender targets and quotas?  We met at one of those."
32D,32D_297,A,"Yeah, we did meet at one of those.  Well, I think it’s a shame that we need them.  But it’s almost one of those things, sometimes you need that, it’s a bit like the IDAHOBIT is it, the International Day Against Homophobia, Intersex, Transgender, whatever that is.  I went to the inaugural one of those at Government House and somebody stood up and said, “Well let's hope we don't need too many of these.”  Isn’t that true?  Hopefully once those quotas are in place that almost force the cultural change and people will go, “Actually that’s not so bad. They’re all right, get a couple on if they’ve got the right skills.”"
32D,32D_298,A,"I was interested to hear, was it, Rebecca?  Yes.  She's on the mining board, the third member of the panel.  When she was quite defensive about being called a golden skirt and implying that that word meant that they all just had cushy jobs and she was saying, “Look, we’ve all had very stellar careers and we’ve made contributions and blah, blah, blah.”  It’s interesting.  I had never interpreted golden skirt to mean cushy job, that they're just putting the same girls on.  I just thought, no they're just proven."
32D,32D_299,Q,They’re stars.
32D,32D_3,Q,"So firstly, we’re trying to get a feel for the discipline background of the people we interview.  So, what’s your sort of background?"
32D,32D_30,A,When exactly was the one?
32D,32D_300,A,"Well they are stars.  But rather than taking a risk, the reason I thought they were called golden skirts was nothing to do with it being a cushy appointment, an easy appointment for the boards, because they already have a very good proven track record.  That was my interpretations of it.  Because when the -"
32D,32D_301,Q,Isn’t that interesting?  I’ve never heard the term before.
32D,32D_302,A,"Yes, the Age.  There's been quite a few articles on it because they're saying for women trying to get onto boards good luck because it's almost a closed shop.  And they mention Nicola Wakefield Evans as being one of them as well, who sit on a few boards, so it's an easy appointment."
32D,32D_303,Q,"Yeah, okay."
32D,32D_304,A,"But I didn’t find it a disparaging term, but obviously they’re not happy with it because they were both quoted in the paper when they were referred to as that as well as saying, “That’s not fair.  That’s not okay.”"
32D,32D_305,Q,And that would be offensive because it makes it sound as though they're not worth the spot.
32D,32D_306,A,"Yeah, whereas my interpretation of it, I don’t know why they – well maybe that is the interpretate – my interpretation was almost like the golden goose.  They are a rarity and they’re amazing and good luck to them."
32D,32D_307,Q,Yeah.  I’m going to search it and see what comes up.
32D,32D_308,A,"Golden skirts, oh yeah, there’s been quite a few articles on it."
32D,32D_309,Q,"I’ll do that.  So, the final question is looking 10 years into the future how would you like to see diversity of Australian Boards?  Why do you think it will be good and what needs to be done for that to happen?"
32D,32D_31,Q,"Exactly, that's great.  And I'm particularly interested in comparisons between the start-up and the government appointment sort of board and the not-for-profit boards that you’re on, like, you know, to compare them."
32D,32D_310,A,"Wow.  10 years’ time, diversity.  I would like to think it was second nature on a board, that it was just, you know, that there weren't quotas, a bit like IDAHOBIT, you know, but we had that quota stuff we've moved on and now boards are truly, genuinely, looking for diversity that's going to help add value to their organisational business.  That's it.  And how are we going to get there, well as I said I guess for quotas and stuff?  It’s going to take a mind shift and sometimes that has to be intergenerational.  Particularly with all the start-ups and as you and I said where it seems to be natural.  Doesn’t feel forced."
32D,32D_311,A,"It’s almost like, you know, the digital natives compared to those of us who’ve had to learn technology.  I guess my hope if it doesn’t happen in ten years that I’m sure it will eventually happen.  I’m feeling quite confident about that, particularly as we know that if you look at in states the top, I don’t know, 50 companies, most of them weren’t around 20 years ago.  They’re all new companies, that no-one would have predicted would be monopolising the share market.  So, I’m assuming that with all of that, with those start-ups taking over the world of investment and economics that it’ll eventually get there.  Well, that’s my hope anyway."
32D,32D_312,Q,"Yeah.  Well, the ones I've interviewed they certainly value the kind of diversity in terms of different ways of thinking, creative, innovative, not being risk averse sort of thinking.  Is very much what I heard from them, so it was pretty exciting."
32D,32D_313,A,Yeah.
32D,32D_314,Q,I said to someone I felt like I was an FJ interviewing a Ferrari.  Their energy was amazing.
32D,32D_315,A,That’s a sad comparison.
32D,32D_316,Q,"Oh no, I don’t worry."
32D,32D_317,A,I’m sure that’s not true.
32D,32D_318,Q,"No, no, no.  It was – there was just a qualitative difference, it was wonderful.  Because I’m not – not me personally but the theory, do you know what I mean?  The theory, the understanding that I was getting from the literature and stuff and then here it’s like – so I’ve got baggage of an FJ.  And here’s this Ferrari."
32D,32D_319,A,"God, what are you talking about diversity?"
32D,32D_32,A,Yes.
32D,32D_320,Q,"This was great, I love it."
32D,32D_321,A,"Surely, it’s just the right person for the job."
32D,32D_322,Q,"Yeah.  No, it wasn’t sad, it was inspirational."
32D,32D_323,A,"Oh, good."
32D,32D_324,Q,It was fantastic.  I went out on a high.
32D,32D_325,A,Good.  I’m pleased to hear that.
32D,32D_326,Q,Thank you so much.  I loved what you could -
32D,32D_327,A,I’m glad I’ve been helpful.
32D,32D_328,Q,"Exploration of culture and how to understand diversity and conflict.  And I really like that, I find that really helpful.  So, thank you so much."
32D,32D_329,A,Good.  My absolute pleasure.  Look forward to hearing more about your studying.  I hope.
32D,32D_33,Q,If they're different.
32D,32D_34,A,"They are very different.  I think as we discussed at the 30% club the start-up is much younger and I would say naturally more diverse, even though it’s a small team.  The government one that I'm on -"
32D,32D_35,Q,Are there many men?
32D,32D_36,A,On the start-up?
32D,32D_37,Q,Yes.
32D,32D_38,A,"I think it's an even split.  Or there's two women and there's three blokes.  I think was another woman but I'm not sure whether she's continued or whether she's stepped away.  But I think there's probably three and three.  With the government-appointed board, I'm finding that absolutely fascinating because I've only been on the for a year and the chair of that board who is a woman, who is very impressive, she's only been on it for four years and she's the longest-serving director.  So, I think as I mentioned to you, they went through a period of because it’s a regional board as well, that if you were someone of some standing in the local community and you wanted the gig, bang you were on.  I think the government has gone to great efforts to make it a skills-based board.  So that's quite a refreshed board I would say.  Deliberately refreshed by the government."
32D,32D_39,Q,"In the last five years, yeah, was it?  Four?"
32D,32D_4,A,"So, my career has predominantly been in advertising agencies.  Big multinationals mostly.  I've worked for four of them."
32D,32D_40,A,"I’d say, yeah, the last four.  Four years."
32D,32D_41,Q,"Four years refreshed.  What do you think drove that, that government lack of -"
32D,32D_42,A,Well can I speak freely?
32D,32D_43,Q,"Yeah and don’t say anything that makes it define, you know, like so that we can’t -"
32D,32D_44,A,I won’t be defamatory.
32D,32D_45,Q,"No, no.  That we can know which board it is, that's all.  Just goods."
32D,32D_46,A,"Oh, okay.  It’s a government one, but I won’t say specifically obviously which one.  It will be hard to track down which one that is."
32D,32D_47,Q,Exactly.
32D,32D_48,A,"But I think with that one that the government were not happy like there's a relatively new CEO as well and I don't know that it was that well managed or governed prior to that refreshment.  In fact, there's a bit of a legacy that we're sort of, you know, I would say a bit of mopping up that we’re still doing in terms of things like financial management, procedures, policies, culture, all the usual ones that are all being - we’re going, oh, there are things that come in the board papers, within themselves are perhaps slightly concerning but are absolute indicators that the culture needs work etcetera.  So, I think that's why that board, the government decided to refresh it."
32D,32D_49,Q,"So how many people on the new board, the refreshed board come from the regional area and how many from cities?"
32D,32D_5,Q,"So, are you in marketing?"
32D,32D_50,A,"So from the regional area, and that was quite controversial for some of the people who weren't reappointed, in fact there's been some scathing emails that shot around which the chair apologised for because of the board attendance at a particular event at short notice, because this person is not happy that two of us are from Melbourne and one is from another nearby regional area, but not from that one.  Just trying to have a think how many people are actually on that board.  Maybe there's 10 or 11, I'm going to say 10.  I can do a count later and come back on that."
32D,32D_51,Q,Is the chair an outsider?  A local?
32D,32D_52,A,No.  She's very much an insider.
32D,32D_53,Q,"Yeah, chair is a -"
32D,32D_54,A,"But she is very much pro-skills based and performance and very procedural.  She's very impressive, I'm very happy to be part of her team."
32D,32D_55,Q,"Great, wow that sounds exciting that board."
32D,32D_56,A,"It is, it is.  I'm learning a lot.  So yeah, that's good."
32D,32D_57,Q,"Yeah, really good.  And you’d be contributing a lot, yeah, be fascinating.  And your other not-for-profit boards, the two?"
32D,32D_58,A,"The two, yes.  So, how different are they?  Well, I think that's quite interesting.  I'm actually the president of one of those and we've just appointed two new directors.  There was some concern that the number of women on that board as a proportion has diminished.  I think we've now got 11 on that board.  They're big boards in not-for-profit.  I just don't – to be frank I was like, why don’t we just go into the constitution and have a few less, it was good.  Oh, maybe there's nine of us, might be nine.  But even when it got down to seven, I mean seven to me feels like quite a good number for a board."
32D,32D_59,A,"However, what I did learn as president when we were down to seven is that as the president there just aren’t enough people in volunteer positions to call on.  Or you can call on them, but whether they’re actually available and can step up and help, is another thing altogether.  Like actually getting stuff done.  So, the two new appointees, the thing that really attracted me to them was the fact that they struck me as doers.  Which is more important on a not-for-profit."
32D,32D_6,A,"Yeah.  Marketing, advertising, comms, that sort of space.  So, having spent about, I don’t know, 20 years of something in four big agencies a colleague and I started our own agency and we built that up over five years and then sold it.  And then once I sold that, one of the reasons that I was keen to get out anyway was to pur32D more board work.  So that's pretty much what my professional background is."
32D,32D_60,Q,"Okay.  So, you need more -"
32D,32D_61,A,I think so.
32D,32D_62,Q,"So, is this merging the operational roles?"
32D,32D_63,A,"No, it’s not merging but when I say more doers maybe it’s historical, but because we had the CEO resign and then we appointed another CEO didn’t work out, had to remove that CEO.  Because there was a lot of things going on, we were looking at a merger with another organisation.  I mean, those things are all quite strategic and actually take up quite a lot of time from the board.  So that I felt was where we actually seemed to do an awful lot.  And like,help, somebody, please.  So, should we ever be in that situation again, I feel that these people might be able to step up."
32D,32D_64,Q,"Okay.  Now, these are really complex things, mergers, replacing your CE.  Do you have a mentor to help you cultivate your skills or are you really quite isolated as a chair?"
32D,32D_65,A,"No, I don’t feel isolated as a chair.  I don’t have a mentor."
32D,32D_66,Q,"Or it may be a coach, or I don’t know."
32D,32D_67,A,"No, I don’t have a mentor or a coach.  I do a lot of mentoring and coaching of other people, but no, I don’t specifically have one.  Although if there was something that was difficult, for example, I'm in a situation right now, last night in fact where between those two not-for-profit boards they're actually related to each other and I'm on both boards.  And there's a little bit of conflict between those boards at the moment.  So, I'm the only president who also sits on that national board.  So, I was concerned about my potential conflict, so I also involved our vice-president and she was more than able to provide me with some additional input and advice.  So that was really good actually."
32D,32D_68,Q,Is she from a legal background?
32D,32D_69,A,"No, no.  This is just – no, but she knows the relationship.  Some of the directors have no idea what’s going on with the national body.  So, it was good to – and in fact, even when I called on her last Friday when I couldn’t make the telly conference with the presidents, she was so apologetic and kind of, “I'm so sorry.”  As it turned out couldn’t find anyone, so we didn’t have anyone.  Half of them are swanning around Europe, half their luck."
32D,32D_7,Q,Great.  So how many boards have you sat on?
32D,32D_70,Q,It's a bad time of year.
32D,32D_71,A,It’s that time of year.  Try and find a director between meetings at this time of year.
32D,32D_72,Q,"So how often do you have meetings, just out of interest?"
32D,32D_73,A,For all of the boards?
32D,32D_74,Q,Well is it typical -
32D,32D_75,A,"Well they’re typically every couple of months.  So, they’re no more often than that."
32D,32D_76,Q,"Right.  So, do people go away and you’re on quite a few boards, do you sort of have just little windows?"
32D,32D_77,A,"No, they come in a run.  It’s just hideous they all have us – oh, thank you, that's very kind of you.  Thank you.  They tend to come in a run, which is ever exciting because I have my day job as well a consultant and quite often there's another regular gig that I do for a client.  It all seems to happen at the same.  So, I just have to keep going until it's all done.  And I'm on quite a few of the committees of various organisations as well.  So, committee meetings in between.  So, I'm on the FARG committee which is the Finance, Audit, Risk and Governance Committee of the national one.  I'm also the secretary on that board, so I'm on their secretariat."
32D,32D_78,Q,You do a lot.
32D,32D_79,A,"The one here, the state one that I’m president of, I was on governance committee and the CEO just took me off.  Didn’t even really ask me, he goes, “Yeah you were just filling in, I'll take you off that one.”  I went that’d be great.  And the regional one I’m on the community engagement committee."
32D,32D_8,A,A total of five.
32D,32D_80,Q,"Oh, great."
32D,32D_81,A,"So, there’s lots of meetings, lots of – yeah."
32D,32D_82,Q,"Right, okay."
32D,32D_83,A,Between all of those.
32D,32D_84,Q,"You’re a very busy woman.  Brilliant.  Now, so we want to know sort of around whether the diversity, the composition of boards have changed over time in terms of diversity.  Now you’re looking across three in different sectors, different kinds of organisations.  Has there been a trend over the 11 years, what is it, since 2010?"
32D,32D_85,A,"Look, I’m not sure that I’m well qualified to answer that, the first board that I was on was an executive board.  So even though I was on the board we were all in the business, so they weren’t external appointments.  And again, the criteria for that board was, “You’ve been here for a long time, we think you’re doing a good job why don’t you jump on the board?”  It wasn't a skills-based board at all, in fact, I resigned from that board quite controversially because I said, “This isn’t a.”  I mean, I’d never been on a board, but I go, “This is not how a board operates.  I am so sure this is not how a board operates.”  So anyway, I elected to get off that one and then some months later I left the agency.  So that one wasn’t really one I could judge."
32D,32D_86,A,"The national one that I'm one, that one is they're appointed by the network, each member of the network nominates a director.  So again, that's not skills-based either, which is not a good thing.  I think we should be moving to a skills-based organisation.  And because this is all highly confidential, I will say it, there are some people on that board I go, “I don’t know what you’re doing here.  You’re warming a seat, you’re here for the biscuits.”  I don’t know, not a lot of contribution from some of those directors because they’ve just been nominated to turn-up."
32D,32D_87,A,"So, I think that’s really poor, but that's the nature of a federated model which is less than ideal.  The start-up that I'm on, that's absolutely skills-based.  But that was just, I met with the founder and just talked about the kind of things that I do, and he went, “Do you want to be on the board?”  And I went, “Yes.”  Well actually before I said yes, I said, “Who are the people, what are the other skills?”  So that one’s – so, I’m not sure I can say has it changed over time -"
32D,32D_88,Q,"Yeah, it’s okay."
32D,32D_89,A,-@ Sorry Margo.
32D,32D_9,Q,Wow.
32D,32D_90,Q,"Yes, that's okay.  That's good.  And because of the diversity of sectors, it's probably hard to look at a trend over time too, because it’s been different."
32D,32D_91,A,"Yeah.  But probably the one the health one in the regional centre, five years ago, or four years ago, what’s this 15?  I mean, there’s been a lot of reform in that sector in terms of governance here in Victoria following Duckett’s Report and various things like that.  So, healthcare governance is big, so presumably, it's been -"
32D,32D_92,Q,Shaping board.
32D,32D_93,A,-@ although I will Say we only deal with dead people.
32D,32D_94,Q,You only deal with dead people?
32D,32D_95,A,Dead people.
32D,32D_96,Q,"Oh well, great."
32D,32D_97,A,"I think we come under, yeah, we must come under health.  We do come under health, but everyone’s dead by the time they come to us, so it’s all good."
32D,32D_98,Q,"Okay.  You just might be very busy.  Hopefully less busy now.  So how important do you think it is to have a diverse board?  If let’s say, 10 is extremely important and one is not important at all."
32D,32D_99,A,10.  Absolutely 10.
33D,33D_1,Q,"Okay Participant 33D, thank you so much for agreeing to participate in the research, it’s really fabulous.  As you know the research is about diversity of boards and we’re asking people who sit on boards and organisations that influence them, how they understand diversity and how it might best be managed; so thank you so much."
33D,33D_10,A,"What have - it’s a really difficult thing to answer in one way because there’s so many different things that you see.  I think there’s a lot of evidence of boards out there being really focused on building a diverse board and you see particular focuses around bringing on gender - meeting gender diversity aspirations and I think there’s a certain sector of board too - probably more in the not-for-profit space that looks to have a representation of what their target client or member base is which I think to me, points to the fact that it’s not impossible if that’s a conscious decision that you’ve made at your board."
33D,33D_100,A,"The way that that program runs is that you have 12, and I mean we were the pilot group so we were kind of testing the model.  You have 12 women with the chair and the chair’s role is to help prepare the group to make sure, you know, your CV’s ready, your value proposition’s ready, that you really clear on who you are and what value you bring to the table and where you’re going to target yourself."
33D,33D_101,A,"Then they bring a series of people to the table to talk to us about what we’re dealing with, where they see that we should focus, how they could help.  There were directors who’d been on company boards when they’d gone through a crisis, women who’d been real leaders in the past in terms of breaking down the barriers and getting on to ASX boards, ASX experienced people like David Gonski who have been there and seen a lot of war stories."
33D,33D_102,A,"In terms of, did they tell us - not really because it was more about facilitating a conversation around the table of our collective experiences and supporting one another.  It’s been a brilliant way of having a network to support other women.  We’ve done a lot a work for one another since that ended last year, and introductions, and tips, and sharing information.  I think that’s good."
33D,33D_103,Q,I’ll talk to you about that later.  I need to - because you’ve got some great stuff -
33D,33D_104,A,Is it good?
33D,33D_105,Q,"Absolutely, do you think that there's any situational context that might cause you to change that 10 rating?  That diversity’s not important, in a particular situation that the board might face?"
33D,33D_106,A,In a particular situation?
33D,33D_107,Q,Or is it always important?
33D,33D_108,A,"If you think about the role of the board, you’re there to govern and guide and help management achieve the best in terms of performance and success - whatever that success criteria is for the organisation."
33D,33D_109,A,"To me, that's a lot about asking questions and making decisions and to make, or to be involved in robust decision making, you need to have lots of different perspectives.  So if you've got six people that all look largely the same, from the same privileged white Caucasian background - that I come from by the way.  How are we going to make a good decision?  We’re going to make a decision that’s based on our bubble and I quite often have this conversation with my husband who’s also involved in a lot of boards, and you really can’t."
33D,33D_11,A,"It seems to be, to me, without facts and figures in front of me, it seems that the bigger end of town holds a lot of - or holds the most resistance to that focus on building a diverse board that is reflective of what your staff group or target client or member base is; or indeed the broader community.  I don’t think anybody could argue the point anymore that diversity on a board increases performance of the organisation irrespective of what the performance, the success criteria in terms of performance for any organisation is."
33D,33D_110,A,"Even when we talk about things that are happening in our local community and you start to hear things about home invasions and people pulled up in the street and that lady who someone jumped in and drove off in her car with her baby in the backseat.  It's really hard to fathom that that could happen in our street, it’s happening a few suburbs away but by the same token if you don't bring that thinking about these are the things that might happen, to the table and you’re only thinking about your very safe, happy little bubble; well how can you make a good decision without other people’s perspectives and life experiences?  So, no, I cannot think - very long answer, I’m really good at long answers- I cannot think of a situation that a board wouldn't benefit from diversity at the table"
33D,33D_111,Q,"That's pretty consistent.  I don’t think I’ve - one person has given a qualified yes, out of forty, I’ve interviewed."
33D,33D_112,A,"Yeah, I was going to ask you how many people you’re interviewing.  I just can't think of one.  And they say if you’re running something that's really ho-hum and there’s nothing changing, and you've got no challenges and you’re not looking for growth - maybe."
33D,33D_113,Q,Is that a board?
33D,33D_114,A,"There’s no pulse, it’s not alive."
33D,33D_115,Q,"Yeah exactly.  Approach to problem solving is- like cognitive diversity is a term that’s out there and so [approach] 0:41:44.  2 as problem solving - that diversity of that, that kind of diversity is seen as important by some people.  Do you think that’s important?"
33D,33D_116,A,"I guess it's another element of what we’ve been talking about talking about overall, isn’t it?"
33D,33D_117,Q,"I think so.  You’ve got diverse perspectives; this is approaches to problem solving, cognitive diversity.  We had the woman with the acquired brain injury but she was presenting the perspective of people with disability rather than different ways of thinking.  Is that important, do you think - different ways of thinking?"
33D,33D_118,A,Different ways of thinking.
33D,33D_119,Q,Different approaches to problem solving.
33D,33D_12,A,"We’ve seen study after study after study pointing to that, so you really then beggar’s beliefs that not only are we not getting to reasonable equality in terms of gender diversity but as I was saying to you before the interview, I despair of how we’re going to reach true diversity of all groups within our community when we’ve had a topic that’s been talked about adnauseam for decades, and we still can’t even get what to me, looks like the simplest one and that is gender diversity."
33D,33D_120,A,"I don’t know what it is in my mind, but I'm not - I haven't got a different way of thinking about that particular element."
33D,33D_121,Q,One person said to me people on boards -
33D,33D_122,A,Perhaps give me an example [overtalk] 0:42:49.  1
33D,33D_123,Q,"People on boards are often from backgrounds where they’re outcomes focussed, very much outcomes focussed, and the process thinker is very useful."
33D,33D_124,A,Okay I get where you are coming from now.
33D,33D_125,Q,So process thinking is very -
33D,33D_126,A,"The system’s thinking, the problem solving.  I guess for me, that is part of what you get by bringing diverse groups and experiences to the table.  Because you’re right, some people see in very black and white, others will look at it from a systems perspective and you get to a very different approach."
33D,33D_127,A,"The other thing that's a really good way of thinking about things is to be more long term as well.  One of the things that I've seen historically with boards and management teams and strategies is you kind of get this three to five year focus and you're might renew it annually; and there's been lots of conversations about keeping strategy live in the boardroom, keeping strategy live with the management team, and constantly reviewing it.  To me that's very much a different way of thinking, other than a set and forget style of thinking."
33D,33D_128,A,"What I have been encouraging on the boards that I’m on is to think out to20 years.  Because to me, that gives you another way of thinking, even for people who are black and white, it's yes or it's no, you’re in or you’re out, or you’re a systems thinker and think about where else you should planning or thinking or what else should you be thinking about?"
33D,33D_129,A,"I think broadening out that to a 20 years scenario - and I had a very real example of that, with our private health insurance -  by thinking out to 20 years, we're all of a sudden instead of thinking that we need to deal with government reforms and the potential two percent gap that the labour government was proposing as part of their election platform, and looking at what all the changes in terms of prosthesis costs and inflation and the cost of medical technology - you sort of think about all these things and what's going to happen in five years, how we’re going to deal with it."
33D,33D_13,Q,Do you think the same barriers to gender diversity impact other kinds of diversity?
33D,33D_130,A,"All of a sudden with that 20 year mandate, well we might not be here but what do we want the organisation to be?  And that opens up thinking and people who I had seen very much drill down into the numbers or down into the what do we do to engage with the community.  We’re all of a sudden thinking more broadly and we changed our strategy from - I can’t even remember what we used to call our longer term vision but it was pretty ordinary; and now it’s all about being the number one regional private health insurer in Australia."
33D,33D_131,A,"Now without that20 year perspective, we wouldn't have got to that position.  We might have said we want to be the leading regional insurer in Victoria maybe, I don’t know.  But we’ve now got a board and a management team that is open to so many different conversations and different ways of thinking.  So to me, that again, maybe that goes to your cognitive diversity -"
33D,33D_132,Q,"Yes, that’s great.  That’s a really nice - nice Participant 33D, very good."
33D,33D_133,A,"Once I understood the question, I had an answer."
33D,33D_134,Q,"Well you make your own sense of the question because I mean these are just terms, different ways of probing, understanding the diversity that - yep, that’s really good.  Do you think there’s a - you know, we’ve now talked about a lot of different kinds of diversity, is there a particular kind of diversity that matters more than others or are they -"
33D,33D_135,A,What kind of diversity?
33D,33D_136,Q,Does it depend or the -
33D,33D_137,A,"Particular kind of diversity.  It’s a really hard one to answer because I don't think you can section out any one group, or gender, or sector and say one’s more important than the other.  I think it's about getting the mix right and in a very, I guess, simple approach I think is that skills matrix to me, and as I mentioned earlier, I think if you focused on, here’s our board - sorry here's our organisation, here’s our strategy and what we want to achieve, here are the skills that we think we need at our board and management level, and from a board perspective here’s our skills matrix, what have we got; and be really honest about what you're good at and what you’re not so good at."
33D,33D_138,A,"To me, you’re going to get the diversity factors that are the most reflective of what your organisation needs.  I think to say that one group’s more important than the other is not a simple answer because I think the answer is it depends on your organisation and what it’s setting out to achieve, what diversity factors might be more important to you."
33D,33D_139,Q,"So the purpose of the organisation and depends whether you’re framing it 20 years from now or three to five; so your premise - your systems thinking and an outcomes focus, because you might use your - because we’re thinking - we’re developing a model and so I’m trying to addend - people are saying in to something that could be modelled."
33D,33D_14,A,"In my mind, I think other kinds of diversity are going to be up against an even tougher climb uphill.  I think it becomes a real struggle against people’s unconscious bias, I think.  Because there seems to be general conversations that you have that, well what do we do if we’re going to have a diverse board?  Do we really need to go out and get one Asian, one black person, make sure that somebody’s from a tech savvy background and how can we possibly have a 25 year old on our board?"
33D,33D_140,A,"I’ve seen great things happen.  When I did my MBA, it was when I was first exposed to the thought or the theory of systems thinking and it really blew my mind, particularly in the role that I had with VMIA, but also in the management roles I had before that."
33D,33D_141,A,"I think that systems thinking filter gives you that, I guess, that frame to start to make sure you’re considering all the things you need to consider."
33D,33D_142,A,"One of the things I found in my role at VMIA is there’s some really smart people in state government departments, and there's also a tendency for operating in a silo, and even within the organisations that sit around that; just this kind of silo approach to I’m doing my job and they’re doing really good work and they’re working really hard but that ability to sit up and think about, “Well how can we work together?”  And I’ve seen that first hand at [VBA] 0:49:28.  1 in particular; that making it almost a mandated thing to collaborate."
33D,33D_143,A,"When we brought in a new CEO and the conversations we were having at board and with the management team was around we can’t just stay in our universe here and do a great job.  If we don't talk to other people, that doesn't matter so much.  So it’s around collaborating with other regulators, collaborating with our lead department, collaborating with the insurer."
33D,33D_144,A,"I’ve seen it in private health insurance which is now regulated by AHPRA.   There was a real fear factor around, “Don't go near the regulator, we don't want to get noticed.  ”  Because I’d worked really closely with regulators, I’m like, “Yeah let's go and meet with the regulator.  We need them to know who we are you and have confidence and trust in us because they’re new to regulating this space too; let’s be part of the conversation.  ” So that kind of don’t just play you're part in the universe, bring in others around you and seek to engage and I think everyone ends up all the better for it."
33D,33D_145,Q,"You talked about the purpose defining getting the mix right, well then it's the view of how do you view your organisation in relation to broader players, stakeholders or whatever -"
33D,33D_146,A,"You are not the system, you’re a part in it - you’re a little cog."
33D,33D_147,Q,"Yeah and they that might think, “We need some people who understand regulation.  ”"
33D,33D_148,A,"Whereas is you’re sitting there thinking, “Don’t go near the regulator”, well -"
33D,33D_149,Q,"Yeah, you’re getting the mix right, you won’t have anyone who understands regulation because you’re keeping away from them, they’re not part of you."
33D,33D_15,A,So it’s almost a dismissive - some of the conversations I’ve had there’s been almost a dismissive approach to diversity rather than a let’s embrace it for the value that we could get from it.
33D,33D_150,A,"Yeah, not going to talk to them."
33D,33D_151,Q,"So that’s another part of your model, exactly.  Now I've got some questions on board functioning and managing diversity.  So you’ve answered a lot of questions, I’ve let you go because I think you get depth with the story."
33D,33D_152,A,Sorry.
33D,33D_153,Q,"No, please don’t - just forgive me because I’ll just quickly scan to make sure.  Do you think - well how do you think that diversity can contribute to conflict on boards?"
33D,33D_154,A,"I think that comes back to culture.  If the board doesn't promote the right culture and it also comes back to something I referred to earlier around inclusion.  So if you don’t overtly - and I think this is the board's role, as it is with everything.  If the board doesn’t lead by example and set the time at the tone at the top, how on earth is the management team or the organisation going to reflect that cultural need for inclusion.  If you don’t have that inclusion factor working well then diversity’s dead anyway because it's just a whole bunch of people, isn’t it?"
33D,33D_155,Q,And then it’s conflict.
33D,33D_156,A,"Not feeling empowered or I think, if you’ve got people who are disengaged, that in itself promotes conflict.  I think at the board it’s really important to have a chair who encourages input from everybody and really sets the scene from the start that I will be seeking the views of each director."
33D,33D_157,A,"Thankfully in my experience, I’ve got chairs who do actually do that and they start out with - particularly on the strategic items, I’ll go around the table and get everybody’s view.  Sometimes that falls in to there’s a lot of people talking about not too much, but it's also creating that space where - and I think the chair is really integral to this, creating that space where he or she is going to make it clear that they're coming around to get your views, but also making it clear if the person before you said what you wanted to say, you don't have to add something else to it for the sake of it."
33D,33D_158,A,"So making it okay for you to go, “Agree with everything that's been said, haven't got anything else to add.  I think we're on the right track.  ”  Or, “I agree with those two points but maybe on the third one we should also think about - or how much we look at”, kind of leading on rather than repeating or saying something because you feel the need because they’re going around the table.  Make it safe to say nothing further."
33D,33D_159,Q,"Yeah, and that shows listening by other directors which is part of inclusion, you listen to other people’s points of view, I guess."
33D,33D_16,A,"With this interview coming up, I’ve been very conscious of asking other directors that I’m on boards with just - not specifically from the perspective of I’m doing an interview what can you tell me, but just to get a sense of what people are currently thinking because it changes from time to time.  I’ve had some fellow female directors citing recent examples of an ASX board that one particular lady I know is on, recruiting for two new directors and in her view, one role just screams out for being a really good fit to a female background in skills and experience, and she said and the second one when they’re looking at their skills matrix, could fit either or.  They’ve got eight men to interview and two women.  And that’s coming through whatever recruitment agent they’re working with and she was appalled for having just joined this board a few months ago, to look at it from the point of view that we’ve got 10 people that are all of a similar age group and cultural background, and out of those we’ve got eight men and two women and a recruitment firm saying there are no women."
33D,33D_160,A,"And management notice that.  Management notice how directors interact.  We all sit there and you know you forget that you are - we sometimes can forget that people really look up and look to the board for leadership and for setting an example.  I think directors really need to understand their role in sending a really clear message that if they’re behaving badly at the board table, well you’re not going to - you can’t expect inclusion across the organisation, it’s just not going to happen.  That filters down in a heartbeat, bad behaviour at the board table."
33D,33D_161,Q,So it really is setting the tone at the top.  Have you an example of when conflict or suppression of voices occurred?  Have you got an example to help us understand that?
33D,33D_162,A,I’ve got a few examples of that.  I'm just trying to think about the link back into diversity rather than it’s just bad behaviour.
33D,33D_163,Q,This is a culture then that is against hearing different perspectives?
33D,33D_164,A,"Yes, I guess on a no names, no 0:55:27.  3, I’ve been involved in a board where the model was managing director rather than CEO and board, and that kind of - I'm actually a fan of the CEO and the board model.  I think it frees the board up to have, in a lot of cases, broader conversations.  And I also -"
33D,33D_165,Q,So what’s the difference?
33D,33D_166,A,"Well managing director, you’re the CEO and you’re on the board."
33D,33D_167,Q,"You’re actually a member of the board, right."
33D,33D_168,A,"Yeah, rather than reporting to the board.   So there’s lots of arguments for and against that but this particular case that I’m reflecting on, the managing director - in the role for quite a long time, quite bullying behaviour with his management team and I could see that in the way that if the managers were - well they came to the board meetings, but if they were asked questions that you can see them looking to the managing director to answer them first."
33D,33D_169,A,"So however it had happened, they were pretty clear on the fact that they didn’t open their mouth unless the managing director said it was okay.  What I saw there was a board that lacked life.  I think were quite fearful of the managing director and it meant that the board wasn't getting the information from the management team or the managing director that it needed to undertake its role, and whenever we tried to get pieces of information there was push back on it.  It was just meant the organisation was going to fail, ultimately."
33D,33D_17,A,"Where in her view, the roles that they’re looking for and the skills that they identified on their board skills matrix are absolutely suitable to a female executive background or a female board member’s background, and that’s what’s coming to the tables.  So you also question what’s the role of - or what could the role and the value of recruitment agencies be?  There is a core group of recruiters that are quite active in director roles and what are they experience and what role can they play in helping to shift this.  She actually challenged her board on the fact that we’ve got no diversity here, let alone gender diversity, and the board were quite - or the other members of this board that were on the interview panel were quite comfortable with the recruiter’s done their best and they’ve only turned up two women, so there’s not enough women out there who are looking for these roles."
33D,33D_170,A,"Thankfully there are a lot of changes made, but if that had of been allowed to go on, you know that was an absolute perfect example of a lack of diversity, a lack of inclusion; the board had no role, and indeed the management team had no role other than to do what the managing director said.  So you’re running a whole organisation on the mandate for you on perspective of one person.  I don’t care how brilliant you are, you’re not going to have the answer to the universe.  So to me, that a really -"
33D,33D_171,Q,That’s the antithesis.
33D,33D_172,A,"I was going to say it’s a fabulous example, it’s a terrible example but it really proved to me that without the right information, without robust discussion, without consideration of other views, you’re not know doing - you’ve got no hope of fulfilling the mandate of the board, of a director’s role; and indeed, the board role."
33D,33D_173,Q,It’s really a good example.
33D,33D_174,A,Fun to be a part of fixing; it actually is; it’s very rewarding to be a part of fixing and seeing the management team shine.
33D,33D_175,Q,"So did you see it when, I presume the managing director was removed; did you see it through?"
33D,33D_176,A,Hm.
33D,33D_177,Q,"How did it [unclear] 0:58:51.  2, let’s see the transformation then."
33D,33D_178,A,"The transformation is profound by taking that one person out, bringing in a CEO, setting the scene, being completely open and honest about the history, the culture, the problems that we’re going to be need to be dealt with.  Absolute transparency with the management team about what expectations are for the future; really working at bringing in other experts to the table to really quickly broaden out our mind on strategy.  Getting the CEO engaged in - find all the problems, bringing out all the bodies, get them all out, work out what we’re dealing with here and you know that’s less than 12 months down the track and just looks like a different place to be."
33D,33D_179,A,"You’ve got managers bringing papers to the board that are well thought out, insightful, encouraging discussion, open to feedback.  You know directors now are kind of sitting up and a whole new less of life"
33D,33D_18,A,"So again, that takes me back to, if we can’t get that even reflective in who are we interviewing, how then do you start to bring different cultural backgrounds, abled, disabled points of view youth.  I think one of the other factors that you look around a board table, there’s always that kind of - and maybe this is a little bit cliché - but there’s always the accountant, the lawyer, the subject manner expert; and if you’re going to take that approach, where’s the innovation expert?  Where’s the person with the technology expertise?  The reason we don’t see those, in my view, on boards, is because that people with those skills are younger and boards, I don’t think in the main have figured how to bring younger people through that world.  There’s almost a perception that you must have been a CEO, you must have run enormous organisation to bring value to the conversation.  To me, the board is a collaboration and whilst you all need to be across governance, whilst you all need to be across finance and be accountable for what the organisation that you’re charged with governing an oversight, you don’t need to be an accountant, you need to be a lawyer, you don’t need to have run a massive organisation in the [C-suite] 0:08:12.  9 to bring value to that conversation, if you have got the other competencies that you need to be a good director.  But there’s no - to my mind, I’m seeing very little evidence of that in people’s thinking.  It’s oh no they’re too young, how can we possibly bring them in?"
33D,33D_180,Q,So have you got the same directors?  The board didn’t change?
33D,33D_181,A,A little bit.
33D,33D_182,Q,"Did that bring in diversity, the change?"
33D,33D_183,A,Not enough yet but it’s starting to.
33D,33D_184,Q,Excellent.
33D,33D_185,A,So I think that’s a great example of seeing how an organisation and a board can function when it's got that broader perspective and broader thinking rather than just all shut down.
33D,33D_186,Q,"Exactly, so this is your cognitive diversity, this is an example of how it was closed down by this tyrannical thinking and then remove that and you’ve got -"
33D,33D_187,A,"And we’ve got general managers now coming up to directors at the end of the meeting and saying we love this, this is fantastic, we’re so glad we stuck it out and you’re doing everything you said you would do, we’re so glad we’re still here.  And that’s great."
33D,33D_188,Q,Isn’t that wonderful.
33D,33D_189,A,Because they feel heard and empowered.
33D,33D_19,Q,So there’s a bit of ageism out there?
33D,33D_190,Q,"That’s fantastic.  Now Participant 33D, I’m aware of the time -"
33D,33D_191,A,I’m not.  Where are we at?
33D,33D_192,Q,"Well we’re an hour and one minute.  What, three minutes, have you got three minutes?  So there’s questions about identifying your board [members] 1:01:25.  0.  You already mentioned that, the use of the head hunters, we’ll leave it at that.  Tensions, do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process between on the one hand trying to get that collegiate fit with the other board members and on the other trying to avoid group thing, the [unclear] 1:01:45.  2."
33D,33D_193,A,"Can you ask me the first part of that again, sorry."
33D,33D_194,Q,"Yeah, do you feel that tensions can arise between those two goals, one to have a new member that will work with the board, collegiate fit let’s call it, and the other that it will remove the risk of group think?"
33D,33D_195,A,"In my experience I haven’t had that arise.  Any of the conversations that I’ve had in the boards that I’m on - I must be lucky, I’m in groups of people that are open to - it doesn’t create tension to be talking about the diversity factors that we want to  -"
33D,33D_196,Q,So this idea of collegiate -
33D,33D_197,A,"- focus on.  ,"
33D,33D_198,Q,-@ it’s not an issue.
33D,33D_199,A,"I think rather than a collegiate fit, I think a values fit is important."
33D,33D_2,Q,But first of all we just have a couple of demographic type questions.  How many years have you been a board director?
33D,33D_20,A,"I think so; I think that’s going to be a really big challenge.  If we’ve got the perception that you need to have reach the C-suite, well 30-somethings don’t often get there so does that mean they’re not going to be seen as a valuable board member when in fact they’re the ones with the knowledge that all of us who started on green screens don’t necessarily have."
33D,33D_200,Q,Values fit; some people have said that too.
33D,33D_201,A,"I think recognising that you don't need to be best friends but I think underlying you need to come from a similar values perspective.  I think with very dissimilar values that that in my mind would have more potential for conflict, if you’re not collegiate.  I think collegiate is perhaps a potentially dangerous factor to have.  Nice, might be fun and easily to be a part of; but then, I'm much more interested in having a conversation where people bring different views to the table."
33D,33D_202,A,"That’s another thing that I love about being on a board, that I can read a board pack and I always try and single out the top 3 or 4 things that I think I can add value to the conversation or that I want to ask question on or focus on, and there’ll be some things where I’ll think that one’s a no brainer, tick tick, right, look forward to hearing management’s update on that and we’ll being approving that and then I hear three other people say, “Hold on a minute, what about”, and I’m like, “Yeah, wow.  ”"
33D,33D_203,Q,"That’s really easy, yeah."
33D,33D_204,A,"If you have a collegiate, I’m just going to agree what the person next to me said rather than challenge it.  Again you’re losing the potential value that people bring."
33D,33D_205,Q,"Yeah, that’s great.  That’s the consistent three - now I’m interesting in these values fit.  Who sets the values?  Are we talking cultural values, religious values?"
33D,33D_206,A,Well most organisations focus for plenty of years now on defining what the values of the organisation are.
33D,33D_207,Q,The values of the organisation.
33D,33D_208,A,"So there's that element and to me, being in a board role you need -in my view you need to have a sense of alignment or care factor about what the organisation is doing to bring your A game.  There's a lot of work you know when you come down to an hourly rate for a board role, you know, probably get more in a fish and chip shop but that’s not why we do it, is it?"
33D,33D_209,A,"So I think that sort of underlining alignment of your own personal values with the stated values of the organisation is important.  So to me, I find that the engagement with directors if you come from that similar values approach is stronger because you’ve all got the care factor that’s driving you, and that’s different from collegiality."
33D,33D_21,Q,"Exactly, so the natural fit.  You’re a female and how did you get on these boards?  What’s your journey?"
33D,33D_210,Q,"That’s great, that’s really good and then avoiding groups and having that diversity of perspective, you’ve got your values fit with the organisation and its purpose, as your commonality."
33D,33D_211,A,Platform [unclear] 1:05:33.  6
33D,33D_212,Q,"Yeah, that’s fantastic, that’s really good.  That will be good for - that’s easy to model."
33D,33D_213,Q,"From a regulatory perspective, what do you think about gender targets and quotas?"
33D,33D_214,A,"I used to be dead against them.  I used to think that was - I used to think as a race we’d evolved enough not to need targets and mandates, but now I think if we haven't evolved enough to just do the right thing then maybe we do need a rule book that says - you know, set them.  Again, I’ve heard a few blokes go, “You know I can never get a role now because all they want is women.  ”  I’m like, “Isn’t that terrible, imagine how we felt when all they would hire is men.  ”  “Oh yeah.  """
33D,33D_215,A,"Look, it seems to me again, its 2019, why the hell do we need them; but we do.  It hasn’t happened without them.  Maybe we do just to get it from zero to hero and then maybe we can see the value of it and it will just happen in time.  But to me, we need them."
33D,33D_216,A,I hate to think that we need them but we do.
33D,33D_217,Q,So what is it acting against - before the last question.  What do you think those targets and quotas - what are they influencing?  What barrier are they working against?
33D,33D_218,A,Working against?
33D,33D_219,Q,Yeah what are they -
33D,33D_22,A,"What’s my journey?  It hasn’t been easy.  One of things that I’ been really surprised at is - and this is again, I've spoken to some other male and female directors and there’s a bit of a sense that there’s quite a group of influential great female board directors but not all of them will put their hand out and help the next generation coming through."
33D,33D_220,A,What are they coming up against?
33D,33D_221,Q,"Yeah, what are they coming up - because - they’re needed because there’s something working against achieving these targets otherwise they wouldn’t be needed."
33D,33D_222,A,Maybe it comes back to that unconscious bias factor where people think you know someone else's fixing it or they're not really - the conversation we had earlier about perhaps we’re not aware of what the problem is.
33D,33D_223,A,"What are we working against?  It's not one thing, it's so many factors.  There is still some directors who say you don’t need diversity to make good decisions.  There are still some directors who think you don't need women, that you don't need different cultures, that we know what we're doing, look how successful we are.  So you've got that, to the gentleman I was talking about who’s there trying to build density at board space but not completely across all the factors that are meaning that we’re not getting there.  Yeah that's a massive question."
33D,33D_224,Q,"That systems thinking verses- and also then the other stuff you were talking about which was more cultural, women's views of themselves and their preparedness - readiness for boards and challenges."
33D,33D_225,A,What are we working against?  Everything we just talked about.
33D,33D_226,Q,Exactly let’s just dot point the above.  Okay so it’s multi-levelled?
33D,33D_227,A,Yep.
33D,33D_228,Q,"Beautiful, final question.  Ten years in to the future, I thought that was a long way, you said 20 but anyway, if you want.  How would you like to see the diversity with Australian boards?"
33D,33D_229,A,"How would I like to see - that it was no long part of the conversation, but was just happening.  I would like to think that we’re going to be in a world where anybody who aspires to be on a board and has the requisite governance, skills, experience and knowledge, can put their hand up and find a place.  That it is - I think I used this term earlier, that it’s a right not a fight, for everybody.  At the moment it’s a right, not a fight for a certain sector.  Yeah, 10 years - that’s [overtalk] 1:09:16.  2"
33D,33D_23,A,"I’ve actually had some quite overt conversations with people because how did I get on and how did I get my roles is I networked, networked and did more networking; I know where all the best coffees are in Melbourne and Sydney.  What I’ve been truly surprised at is the low level of preparedness for people who are in positions that could help others, of evidence of putting their hand out."
33D,33D_230,Q,What needs to be done to for this to happen?
33D,33D_231,A,"What needs to be done?  In a funny way I think that men are a much bigger part of the solution then we might like to think and I think if we can work by getting the gender issue addressed, that perhaps the lessons from that can help drive the other diversity factors."
33D,33D_232,A,"I think honest and upfront engagement by people in positions of influence and particularly men, I think can drive and challenge each other; I don’t think they see that need to.  So perhaps encouraging - there’s an ad on television at the moment, it’s about sexual harassment and there’s a girl sitting on a train and some guys ogling at her, and another man sees it happening and then, doesn't do anything violent or combative but just steps in between his line of sight."
33D,33D_233,A,"I think men and women, but I think particularly men because there’s more of them in these positions at the moment, I think looking to see where are the opportunities where they can stand up for somebody.  If they challenge when there’s a situation like my friends had recently where the recruitment company has only brought two women to the table.  So, go away and get me 50/50."
33D,33D_234,A,"You know, I had a fabulous CEO in my last executive role who - he and I went to meet with a really large multi-national insurance company and he and I were the representatives from our organisation and four guys flew down from Sydney to meet with us.  The very first thing that he said after the introductions, you know, this is who, who - so haven’t you got any women in this department?  Just in a nice tone, probably nicer than I just used.  And they all looked and went, “Yeah, yeah.  ”  Then they tried to name one.  He said, ""Well I'm really surprised that I've got four men to meet with today.  ”"
33D,33D_235,A,"And he sort of turned and he said, “Because we've got 50/50 here and that's what we expect of all the service providers.  So after we’ve had this conversation today, if we decide to keep dealing with one another that's part of the requirement.  I want 50/50 women and men at the table.  ”  He did it in a way where I thought, “Bloody hell that’s not hard is it?”  You can just say it.  Don’t bring me four blokes, where are your women?"
33D,33D_236,Q,"But if you had said it, it would have sounded - the message -"
33D,33D_237,A,I would have sounded like a whining female.
33D,33D_238,Q,"Exactly, it would have been a -"
33D,33D_239,A,Which takes me back to my comment of I think there’s a really big role for men to play here and how do we let them know that it's not that hard.  It is stepping in front of the pervert on the train; it is saying that we’re sitting in a meeting -
33D,33D_24,Q,Other women?
33D,33D_240,Q,Believe it.
33D,33D_241,A,"- where are your women?  We're talking about an issue that affects youth, where’s a young person, how are you getting that view.  Just being a bit more overt in what they’re prepared to - what they’re not prepared to accept."
33D,33D_242,Q,"Exactly, this is leadership isn’t it?  So leadership, because I could imagine there would be some situation s where a woman may be in a position of power to call it."
33D,33D_243,A,"Absolutely.  But even to your comment [Margot] 1:13:00.  1, if a woman had of - if I had of said that -"
33D,33D_244,Q,In that because it was a gender issue.  But if it’s not a gender issue -
33D,33D_245,A,"It’s not a gender issue, yeah look, everyone’s got a role to play."
33D,33D_246,Q,"Exactly, and that situation - I didn’t want to say the victim but you know what I mean, the disempowered one in the group and that the issue being called out, this minority is being is being disrespected in - if the minority speaks, it’s a very different voice -"
33D,33D_247,A,Absolutely.
33D,33D_248,Q,"- to if others Say, “Hey come on mate.  ”"
33D,33D_249,A,"I think that’s what needs to change, people need to stand up and be explicit about what they’re not prepared to accept."
33D,33D_25,A,"Other women in particular.  Somebody flippantly said to me, “Maybe they’re not seeing you as the right fit for their boards?”  And I said, “But I’m not actually asking them to put me on the board.  ”  Sometimes when you ask them for an introduction to somebody else in their network or you’re sitting having a networking meeting with them and they’ll say, “Yes, I can help you do rah, rah, rah, and I’ll introduce you to these three people.  ”  Then following them up after the meeting, it doesn’t happen, and I’m not about to stalk people, so you just give it up if it hasn’t happened after the first time."
33D,33D_250,Q,"That is fantastic, thank you so much."
33D,33D_251,A,You're welcome.
33D,33D_252,Q,It was really good.
33D,33D_253,A,It was really good to get my brain working on something different too.
33D,33D_26,A,"On the flipside of that, I’ve been for interviews and where I’ve gotten down to the final group of selection for a particular board role and - actually only four months ago I got down to the final two and missed out specifically because they stuck to their skills matrix analysis which I admire.  I think that’s a very smart way of bringing on new board directors and the feedback that I got from the chair of that particular board was that she would have hired me in a heartbeat because she loved the syncing and the intellect and the experience that I brought to the table, but because they’d just lost their main grassroots banker, and they’re a bank, they really needed to bring in grassroots banking to bolster up their skill set."
33D,33D_27,A,"She asked if she could keep in touch with me which I thought, “Yeah okay, fine, I like you.  I only met you in the interview.  ”  But she has since followed me up three or four times.  I’ve seen her at different events around the place.  I saw at the AICD 30% event.  She’s introduced me to three other people in banking networks that chair other member based banks.  We’ve kept a conversation going and she’s really gone out of her way to do those things, it wasn’t something that she just did in five minutes, she’s drafted individual email introductions for me to these other people; when I met her at the networking event she specifically knew who I’d met with, what we discussed, and to me that’s what I would aspire to be."
33D,33D_28,A,"I do what I can on a tiny little level with my credibility in early stage and being a non-executive director.  But somebody who’s in a position of influence like the chair of quite a large member based bank, has really gone out of her way and that gives me heart that there’s hope in there.  But this is why it’s such a difficult question because you can’t say yes, people do this or no they don’t, there’s such a mix.  And I think we’ve just boiled down to the fact that we need more of it in order to - you can’t successfully stage a movement without enough people moving in the right direction, can you?"
33D,33D_29,Q,"Yeah exactly and this phenomena with some women of not helping the young, cultivate the young, and yet others do."
33D,33D_3,A,In total I’ve been a board director for around about six years and the last three years it’s been my full-time role.
33D,33D_30,A,"Well I had another lady - strangely enough I’ve ended up - I targeted getting on a private health insurance board and I’m on a private health insurance board which is fantastic, I love it.  All men by the way, I’m the first woman, and to their credit we’re looking to bring another director on later this year and we’re already talking about here’s our skills matrix, what else do we need.  And the chair has said we must hire another woman.  He said, “I don’t care if the best man on the planet lands and says he wants to be on this board, we’ve got one woman now, we’ve had - Participant 33D’s joined the board two years ago, we need to have another woman, we need to find somebody that we can bring on to the board to keep the balance happening.  ”  I then cheekily threw out, “Well let’s make sure she’s young.  ”  And they’re like, “Why?”  I said, “Because we’re all old.  ”"
33D,33D_31,A,"Having that kind of conversation around here’s our skills matrix, we’d really like to get somebody who’s been involved in a community engagement role, we’d really like her to be a woman and then I’ve thrown in there let’s make sure - we’re all 50 and 60-something, let’s try and see if we can find somebody in her 40s, just to spread it out a bit."
33D,33D_32,A,"That to me is really heartening, particularly because that board is made up of older men who have had a very staple board in terms of there’s people there that have probably been there a little bit too long."
33D,33D_33,Q,Which is more than 10 years?
33D,33D_34,A,"Yeah, like 20, 25 years.  So you could in some ways look at that and think well they’re probably of the demographics that are going to be more resistant to change but they’re embracing it."
33D,33D_35,Q,Why do you think?  [Overtalk] 0:15:00.  2
33D,33D_36,A,"I think they’re smart enough to recognise that - they all come from different backgrounds as most boards do, but I think they’ve got the nous to understand that private health, we’re promoting ourselves as a regional community focused organisation, done a lot of work on culture and values over the last two years and I think they’re all recognising that if we want to be famous for community engagement well we better reflect the community.  It’s a start, having two females -"
33D,33D_37,Q,"Strategic decision, yep."
33D,33D_38,A,"- and four males isn’t the best balance in the world but it’s a start.  The Victorian government put themselves out there in terms of having a 50% target and essentially just did it.  Now there’s also an argument that I’ve heard, I think even at the AICD, I’ve heard it articulated that, well we’ve done that but they’ve put women on to some pretty low level community based boards to get to that number.  Okay, it might not be perfect, but it sends a really strong signal doesn’t it, to the broader community that this is something we care about."
33D,33D_39,Q,"Yeah, and it’s cultivating skills.  It’s like training wheels."
33D,33D_4,Q,"Wow, okay.  How many boards do you sit on?"
33D,33D_40,A,"Yeah and I think some of those community boards, not-for-profits base is some of the hardest work you ever get to do."
33D,33D_41,Q,"Politics, yeah."
33D,33D_42,A,"And lack of support around you to do some of the non-director style work, it’s more of a roll your sleeves up universe in some cases."
33D,33D_43,Q,You’ve worked in that space?
33D,33D_44,A,"Yeah, I have.  More in an executive role where I’ve seen that happen and worked with training and upskilling and building governance skills for boards on some of those community sector organisations.  Because largely they’re manned, in my experience at least, the people that I’ve worked with come to the table with a lot of, I guess [domain] 0:16:54.  0 experience and they’re driven by a particular passion for an organisation wanting to be a part of providing a solution but don’t necessarily bring the governance and board skills to the table with them.  That can be a pretty tough gig, bringing yourself up to speed with that and working in an organisation that runs on the smell of an oily rag."
33D,33D_45,Q,"Yeah and you might have another job as well, or two."
33D,33D_46,A,"Yes, being prepared for a crisis."
33D,33D_47,Q,"Your background is you work in governance, what’s your background?"
33D,33D_48,A,"My background’s financial services.  Sorry, I grew up in general management, financial services roles.  Throughout my career though I really focused on looking for challenging opportunities to lead projects to get involved in whatever new was coming in that space as financial services reform projects and I worked for a non-bank lender that wanted to grow in to general insurance; so just looking for those, I guess, growth and performance improvement projects."
33D,33D_49,A,"My last executive role was with Victorian Managed Insurance Authority and that was servicing risk management in insurance services for all the state departments in our agencies.  So that gave me, I think, a pretty good background to translate into board world, because I’ve been involved in not only that kind of, how do you grow and build performance of an organisation in my general management roles but with VMIA how do you manage risk and looking at diverse organisations, and how is that all managed across this whole enormous group of entities that could be a tiny community service organisation or could be the Department of Health and Human Services."
33D,33D_5,A,"At the moment I’m on four, and they’re a mix.  I’ve got two government boards, one private health insurer and one private education organisation."
33D,33D_50,A,"So it really gives you a good strategic focus on what are the drivers for the organisation, where do you need to focus, what are the sorts of questions you need to be asking.  And even as a manager in helping those clients build and develop, specifically with a focus on risk management; but I was always blown away by if you just kept asking questions, the things that you find out about what their real problems are and what you need to do in terms of improving or finding a solution.  Yeah, ask questions and to me, that translates in to board work really well because you just can’t take anything on face value."
33D,33D_51,A,"You just have to keep asking questions the whole time, which in terms of diversity, one of the things that I’ve focused on in my board roles is understanding what the diversity policy is.  In some cases they haven’t existed and more recently I’ve started to think about it from an inclusion point of view.  So rather than just saying well we need to have a diverse board, a diverse management team, a diverse - reflect the diversity of the community and our employment practices and what our organisation has in terms of the team, the people that it employs.   But if we bring them all to the table, but they don’t feel part of the conversation, what’s the point?"
33D,33D_52,A,"So it’s all around - and I’ve been reading some great things about people with autism being brought in to organisations because they’ve got really strong skills in mathematics and technology systems and that kind of - I don’t say this flippantly but it sounds flippant - that kind of Rain Man focus on the number crunching side of the world.  But then the challenge is how do we make sure that we make those people feel included and that the rest of the organisation or community don’t just kind of treat them as a little offshoot, make them feel part of the organisation.  So I think there’s lots of really interesting benefits that we can gain from bringing in people who we typically see as different and treating them as just another part of the community."
33D,33D_53,Q,Do you think they need to be on the board or can they be brought in as consultants?
33D,33D_54,A,"Yeah, good question.  Again, I - with that roadblock I was talking about before around the age and bringing the skills that people might have in innovation and technology.  I think there’s a really strong case for having advisory boards working in alongside the board, so not necessarily part of the entire board, I guess, agenda."
33D,33D_55,A,"But like we focus of strategy up front in board meetings, or should; bringing in experts as an advisory committee for, you know, let’s have a look at artificial intelligence, what might that do for us?  Just having a topic for an advisory committee to be a part of and to participate in the board and that would also enable us to see the benefit of different cultures, different ages, different backgrounds and if a board can get the conversation going there and see the value, well perhaps that will help in time to bring different diversity factors in to the mainstream board world.  I think that would be a great way for pale, stale males to see that it’s not all about them.  And I say that with a smile on my face because I hear that pale, stale male a lot, but they’re not all like that.  They can be pale, male and exciting sometimes too."
33D,33D_56,Q,"But it can always get tired so you need that bit of additional information, bit of insight."
33D,33D_57,A,"And look, I think there are a lot of great blokes out there doing good things too, so we can’t - that’s the thing, you can’t speak in generalisations, can you?"
33D,33D_58,Q,Male champions have changed.  I’ve been interviewing some of them and they’re amazing.
33D,33D_59,A,"Yeah, and women on boards.  I did their program last year which was the ASX board ready program that they’re doing with women and I was part of the pilot group for that and we had a chair, John [Bread]0:23:09.  1, who’s been on a number of ASX boards, great guy, no nonsense, but he brought together over the series of eight sessions that we had with him, a wonderful group of people who were all prepared to sit around the table with twelve women and we treated it a bit like a boardroom meeting."
33D,33D_6,Q,None of these are - private health insurance is for profit?
33D,33D_60,A,"They were all really open in terms of their support, so people like David Gonski or someone from a recruiter in Sydney; so from all different sort of stages and credibility levels, and that's an example of people who are in those positions being able to really help people move and progress into different roles and they also had a really good focus on bringing people - there was a lady there that had an acquired brain injury.  She told us right up front she said, “I'll probably say things that you’ll think I’m rude.  I’m not rude, I had a really bad car accident I've got - I had a terrible brain injury and I’m fine, but sometimes I don't process things as others might.  ”"
33D,33D_61,A,"Sometimes you know once you know that and she’s up front and open about it everybody gets it and I think that was a really good example of us firsthand experiencing how somebody else can interact and provide just as much value as the rest of us did, but recognizing what her difference is.  I still remember one of the other ladies saying, “Yeah well I’m really direct, people call me rude too, don't worry about it.  ”"
33D,33D_62,Q,"So this woman who had a acquired brain injury, she's already been on boards?  Because I met an organisation, I’m doing some research in that space and I met - different research, and I met an organisation in New South Wales that is actually about facilitating people with acquired brain injury or cognitive disability to have a voice at all levels, so it's very interesting to hear completely out of the blue, women on boards running a program for ASX ready directors that you had someone who identifies with having an acquired brain injury, brilliant.  So that difference is not why she’d be on the board though?"
33D,33D_63,A,"Well that difference is the reason she was on one of her boards, because one of her boards was - and this is where I talk about some of these specific focused disability or health based boards, typically have somebody who has experienced whatever their core mandate is, so she was on a board that was focused on support for people with acquired brain injury."
33D,33D_64,A,"Then you see things, my husband was on a board - was it disability - the name of it absolutely escapes me at the moment because it was quite a few years ago, but it was a disability focus and so I remember him saying that they had three people around the table and one person always had her guide dog with her because she had very limited sight, and there was somebody else there who was in a wheelchair, so that disability focus they brought people to the table as part of the board who had firsthand experience with the issues that they were trying to provide a better world for and solutions for."
33D,33D_65,A,"That shows you the value of diversity and whilst there’s specific for their experience with the disability or health issue, what's the difference in terms of what any organisations ultimately offering in terms of product or service to the community.  Those people live in the community too, so why not get their perspective?"
33D,33D_66,Q,"She was targeting an ASX company?  So that wouldn’t be focusing specifically on disability services, would it?"
33D,33D_67,A,No.
33D,33D_68,Q,"So she is pushing to get through to the broader corporate world, that’s brilliant.  A really good example."
33D,33D_69,A,"There was another girl in that group who was targeting mining which we were all going, “How on earth are you going to break in to a mining board.  ”  She has."
33D,33D_7,A,"It’s technically not-for-profit because it’s a member based organisation, but it’s, I think largely run with more of a commercial focus."
33D,33D_70,Q,"That's wonderful, was she an engineer?"
33D,33D_71,A,"She came from a legal background and a lot of her legal work had been done with companies that are created internationally in mining and resources.  So she had a lot of knowledge about it, but again, that’s kind of an industry that is known for blokes.  But she really sold herself on the fact that she used to say, “Give me my steel cap boots and a hard hat, take me out to the mine”, she found someone who obviously liked her style and liked her approach and I think they’ll do really well having her on board."
33D,33D_72,Q,"It’s brilliant, I wonder if she will bring other women?"
33D,33D_73,A,"Well she was the one that I was telling you about with the eight men, two women to interview, so she's really pushing for other women."
33D,33D_74,Q,"Brilliant, okay.  So how important do you think it is for diversity? Let's say one’s not important at all and ten is extremely important?"
33D,33D_75,A,"Diversity, I think it’s a 10.  To me, it’s a no brainer.  If you were operating in the world providing a product or service to the community, you need to - whether it's on your board or whether it's on advisory members, or however you go about bringing those voices to the table, I think you’re crazy not to."
33D,33D_76,Q,"Can we drill down on this a little more?  With the advisory, the role of an advisory to bring in perspectives from - diverse perspectives verses having diversity within the board decision makers.  How can we work out when to have some diversity - It’s okay to rely on advisory or consultants for this but we want diversity around the table, the board.  When do you do it?"
33D,33D_77,A,"I guess to me, I see it as the thin edge of the wedge and then if we’ve got so many road blocks and conscious or unconscious biases towards having a board that reflects the broader community that we operate in and live in; to me, as I was saying earlier, if we did have a world that could at least open itself up to the advisory board, I think that would help build the case for the value.  To me it’s not either or, it’s that -"
33D,33D_78,Q,Developmental stage maybe?
33D,33D_79,A,"- another way of looking for how you can start to have that conversation.  For me, when I'm looking at the boards that I’m on and have any influence with, they’re the sorts of things that I would talk about."
33D,33D_8,Q,"Of course.  So we’re not-for-profit really, across these.  You sit on four and a director for six years."
33D,33D_80,A,"There's no point going to a board that’s a bunch of blokes, hasn’t got a diversity policy, it’s not even on their radar and saying get yourself a diverse board, you need one of each of these factors.  But to have those kind of conversations and with the board that I talked to you about that are all men, one of the things I’ve said very early on is how do we hear the voice of our customer , how do we know what they want?  “Well you know, we do surveys,” and I looked at the questions they asked the customers and I went, “That’s not telling them what we want.  ” We were leading them to tell us that we’re great.  So let’s throw those questions out.  Now the voice of the customer, how do we get that?  But to me, it’s about playing the long game and figuring out where's the organisation at now and what steps can we take to get to what is, to me, a desirable end state."
33D,33D_81,Q,And what’s that look like?
33D,33D_82,A,"Well that does look like that you've got you've got a board you've got a management team and you’ve got an employee group that does reflect the community that you're operating in, that you might have different ages different backgrounds different abled, disabled tags or different cultural background, and that you really recruit on the basis of, “Here’s our skills matrix, what skills do we need to succeed”, and go out and recruit without any kind of bias or favour of, “This will be a man.  This will be a woman.  This will be an Asian, this will be a 25 year old female IT guru.  ”"
33D,33D_83,A,"You know, really focus on what’s the skill set we need and go out and find the person and I think that would give you a very different outcome than what we’re seeing.  You’re just getting a whole bunch of blokes and the occasional female in the mix."
33D,33D_84,Q,So the assumption is then that the lack of - if I can - the lack of diversity that we have is the product of bias.
33D,33D_85,A,That’s my invalidated view point.
33D,33D_86,Q,If we remove bias and just focus on skills we will have diversity and get the best person for those skills; we will have diversity.
33D,33D_87,A,I think so.  It sounds really easy doesn’t it?
33D,33D_88,Q,"Yeah, the question then is who defines the skills, how are they defined, what biases might be in that."
33D,33D_89,A,"And that brings us to another interesting position that I've heard from more than one person.  That - and I think women bring it on themselves if we just single out women on this as well - that women typically look down the list of selection criteria - of any role, not just board roles, and feel the need to tick every box before they’re confident enough to apply."
33D,33D_9,Q,"First, how has the composition of boards changed over time?  You’ve been involved for six years, what have you seen?  Any changes?"
33D,33D_90,A,"Whereas we constantly hear that a guy will look and go, “Yeah, I can do most of that, off I go.  ”  We’re very hard on ourselves, I think, in the main.  Without sounding like to much of a tosser, I think women put everything else before they get to themselves as well, in a lot of cases.  I think sometimes from a female perspective and perhaps this might start - also apply to other diversity factors, that you feel like it is a fight rather than a right to be in those roles so you really feel the need to be the absolute 100% top performer, top fit, before you’ll put your hat in the ring for the role."
33D,33D_91,A,"So I think we work against ourselves in that regard, but I also see examples of where men will be considered for roles even if they haven’t had board experience and might not have all the selection criteria as a fit, but I’ve seen real examples and heard real examples from other directors and people looking for roles where they get the feedback that they just haven’t got enough of the right fit and then they see the person who gets the role and it’s, they haven’t either.  Is that conscious or unconscious bias?  It could be both, I don’t know."
33D,33D_92,Q,"It’s cultural too, isn’t it?  Okay that’s good.  So, that applies across minority groups, whatever that kind of self-esteem, confidence, whatever we're talking, which is culturally sustained and reproduced; is having an influence."
33D,33D_93,A,"I spoke to the chair of an ASX 100 board just the other day and we were having a conversation - because he's getting involved with the Women on Boards group, the ASX board ready group, and he was asking me about my experience in it and I was talking to him about what we were talking about earlier, about women not necessarily - whilst they might be in a position of influence, they don’t always see themselves as being in the position or choosing to have help others."
33D,33D_94,A,"He was really blown away by that but after we spoke about it for a bit longer he said, “I think you’ve hit on something here.  ”  Because he said, “Whenever I’m looking for a new director and I put the call out to the female directors in my network, I’ve never gotten anyone.  I’ve never gotten anyone recommended to me that’s another woman.  ”  But he said, “When I go to recruiters, I do get a few.  ”  But he said, “Other women haven't recommended other female directors.  ”"
33D,33D_95,A,"So this was across the course of about an hour-and-a-half conversation and we’d started out at that point very early on in the conversation and he’d just looked at me like I was a bit nuts and I just kept talking about something, other topics.  But when it got to the end, he’s like, “Yeah, I’ve thought about what you said; I think you're right, that might be why I’m not getting any referrals from my female networks.  ”  I said, “Okay, what are you going to do about that?”  He said, “I’m going to ring them up and I’m going to specifically ask them why have you never referred another female to me?”"
33D,33D_96,Q,Fantastic.
33D,33D_97,A,"So, it’s those kind of things too.  I think there’s probably a lot more opportunity for men to be part of the solution, the good guys, if they actually understood the problem.  Because he's someone who's already got quite a good mix of gender balance and is really focus on age as well, and in fact he was one of the ones who’s recently talked to me about the advisory board and the that he does do that.  Where was I going with that thought?"
33D,33D_98,A,"Because, even with his focus on wanting to support women specifically in getting board roles, he didn't even have that perspective that he and I talked about; that other women don’t necessarily help the next generation.  So if we haven’t defined the problem maybe that's why people don't know what they could potentially do to help."
33D,33D_99,Q,"Absolutely.  Did Women on Boards, you know the ASX 100, did they talk about this?"
34DChair,34DChair_1,Q,"So thanks very much Participant 34D, for agreeing to be interviewed for our research on the diversity of Australian Boards. We're particularly interested in speaking with people like you, you're a Director of a Board, or more."
34DChair,34DChair_10,A,"And then the publicly listed Board was last December, so it was for about seven months, six or seven months. And the advisory board's been about a year, a bit more than a year."
34DChair,34DChair_100,A,"Yeah, 'tool' is fine."
34DChair,34DChair_101,Q,"The different perspectives, how you're bringing the different perspectives using this method. It has helped you to identify a gap, I gather, because you look through the different lenses, you want this, you want blah-blah-blah."
34DChair,34DChair_102,A,Yeah.
34DChair,34DChair_103,Q,"This, 'We find it hardest here, to tell a story, so we need someone to help us.' Is that sort of how it's worked?"
34DChair,34DChair_104,A,"Yeah, that would be true. That's a good way of putting it."
34DChair,34DChair_105,Q,"That's so interesting because this is so different to any other interview and I tell you what, I am at the end of the interviews, we're nearly 40. We've nearly done 40 interviews and I'm amazed to hear. This is so out there. [laughs] It's great."
34DChair,34DChair_106,A,"Well, I'm still relatively new to the Board world, so maybe I haven't been [unclear] 00:39:19."
34DChair,34DChair_107,Q,"It's great. No, it sounds terribly sensible, don't worry. I'm not being critical in the least, it sounds really, really good. Really effective. It's very different though, so I'm trying to get the questions so that we can see how it maps against more traditional ways of thinking."
34DChair,34DChair_108,A,"Yeah, sure."
34DChair,34DChair_109,Q,"Do people outside the Board influence your selection? So you've identified a gap using your method, how do you then going about getting someone? Like, how are you trying to find someone with this perspective, this funder's background?"
34DChair,34DChair_11,Q,"Have you been on Boards before that, or is the first -"
34DChair,34DChair_110,A,"Yeah, the checking with that, absolutely, it's almost like the social media story I was talking about before, we're testing the environment, just who's out there, who's a good person and does anybody know anybody that has this background, or cares about this particular background? So that's probably another factor here too, the care or purpose side of the person needs to be aligned with the Board that they're talking about. I guess that's particular in a not-for-profit, but there's no reason why it shouldn't be elsewhere. So yeah, no we are definitely testing broadly, and we're not going to choose quickly. We will if we find the right person, but we're not going to rush to something, just to fill a role because - we're conscious of the gap and we cover it, but we're not just going to add somebody in and then still have the gap, kind of."
34DChair,34DChair_111,Q,"I was meaning to ask you, what gender ratio do you have? Like - what's your female/male on your different Boards?"
34DChair,34DChair_112,A,"Yeah okay, so on the not-for-profit there's - two females and then there's two males, including myself as the Chair; and the CEO is a male. But the Company Secretary is a female, so it's kind of 50/50 if you look at gender on management end Board. The iSelect Board is two female and three males, so it's sort of 40/60 I guess. And then the startup is one female and four males, so it's a bit of whack, but the industry that that comes from probably pushes it to that space, because it's an automotive industry. There's not a lot of females in automotive unfortunately."
34DChair,34DChair_113,Q,So do you use recruitment organisations?
34DChair,34DChair_114,A,"We do. Yeah we do. For the not-for-profit we do, definitely. The Chair of iSelect has a pretty extensive network, but yeah, he would use recruitment places when he needed to, I'm sure. But yeah, we do, and there's definitely ones that specialise in the not-for-profit space that I use, particularly one of them which I get a lot of advice from that organisation as well. I meet with that organisation probably every quarter, just to understand what's going on in the not-for-profit marketplace, at the Board level. And I think they also do a bunch of work for Boards, as well as recruit, so they're kind of making their space in the not-for-profit."
34DChair,34DChair_115,Q,"Oh right, so why do you use them, what's your reason?"
34DChair,34DChair_116,A,"Just to understand what's happening, how are decisions being made. Social impact is a fairly recent trade, and social impact investing. So how do we understand what the social impact investors are thinking and wanting, and what does your organisation have to look like to attract that investor? That's been one of the discussions over the last six months or so. Prior that, I was actually looking for corporate, kind of, not-for-profit connection linkages, so people who have that linkage and we were able to find two of those. Both a different gender and differing thinking, or different experience, to be able to add to the Board as well, so that worked that way. Then just generally, what else is happening; who are the other not-for-profits we should be talking to? We talk to them a bit about how they run their operations, what they do, so it's more kind of who should be in the discussion. It's probably that external view, you know, what else is going on out there that we should know about?"
34DChair,34DChair_117,Q,Is that more the industry as well as what do we want in terms of Directors on the Board?
34DChair,34DChair_118,A,"Yeah-yeah, and that's definitely what's going on in the not-for-profit industry, and like I say, social impact investing is a very specific situation. It's probably been around for a long time, but even more so now that there's a number of people creating funds that are just for social impact."
34DChair,34DChair_119,Q,"Yeah, I've talked to organisations that influence investment, they've got a long-term view in terms of socially sustainable investing, and they seek to influence ASX listed companies and stuff."
34DChair,34DChair_12,A,"No, this is the first one. As a partner in Deloitte and an auditing firm, it's extremely hard to do that, so most of us didn't do it. You'd do the odd not-for-profit, but not any other Boards, no."
34DChair,34DChair_120,A,"Absolutely, they definitely do, yes."
34DChair,34DChair_121,Q,"So it is similar to that, or is this something..?"
34DChair,34DChair_122,A,"Yeah-no, no-no this is exactly. And some of them have gone even further, they don't invest in listed companies or anything like that, they're there to fund not-for-profit. They don't just fund any not-for-profit, you have to meet certain criteria to be able to access their investment story, so that's the picture that we're trying to get to. You're right, some of those do invest in organisations, listed companies or whatever, according to their story, which may have social aspects to it, or maybe socially responsible in some form, or whatever they've decided they're going to do."
34DChair,34DChair_123,Q,"So how do you feel, are there ever tensions between when you're selecting a new Board member, between on the one hand trying to obtain a collegiate fit, like someone who's got your - get in with your Board, other members, and on the other hand, trying to avoid group think, or to broaden your view. Do you think this is a potential conflict or tension?"
34DChair,34DChair_124,A,"Yeah, definitely. Group think usually comes around by dominating - some level of domination by a person. So I think it's probably a good Chair doesn't let that happen."
34DChair,34DChair_125,Q,"Oh, let's talk about what a good Chair does. You have to talk about this, I'm afraid."
34DChair,34DChair_126,A,"Yeah well, in my mind, a good Chair is the last person to speak; is there to help the Board get the decision and not force a decision. So therefore a good Chair really needs to be trying to understand what's going on in the room with the Board members and to use questions or discussion, to dig out concerns, or what's going on really. Not the best way of explaining it, but yeah, really sitting back and listening, watching, observing, really trying to understand what's happening."
34DChair,34DChair_127,A,"First of all - I'll just step back a little bit - a good Chair in my mind is one that knows what decision the Board need to make, and then it doesn't have a preconceived idea of what that decision should be; and then makes sure that the Board had the ability to make that decision, firstly in an informed manner, but also using all the skills of that Board. Therefore sitting back, listening, seeing what's going on; watching the body language; creating discussion. If it's not digging deep enough, or people are trying to rush a decision, not letting them rush the decision; making sure everybody's had their say; consider different angles, so using the tool we were talking about, using the tool to draw out more discussion; and then getting the Board to really be comfortable that the decision they're making is the right one, given all the information that's on the table."
34DChair,34DChair_128,A,"I think that's probably my summary of what a good Chair would do, and then obviously a Chair is identifying where is this business going, and what skills and capabilities do we need to be able to guide it to the right place? How do we actually fill those roles; what external help do we need?"
34DChair,34DChair_129,A,"Interestingly, the Chair of iSelect, he quite often brings in external people to spend half an hour talking to us about a topic. At the time you don't quite realise why he's done it, but in three months' time it becomes obvious because we're now about to make the decision, that he's helped us create some level of being informed along the way so that we're building our knowledge of what it is that respectively, we're going to have to make a decision on down the track on it. So that's a neat way of doing things as well."
34DChair,34DChair_13,Q,"So is your background in accounting/finance sort of thing, or..?"
34DChair,34DChair_130,Q,"Yeah, okay. So what I'm hearing then, to sort of summarise, the Chair's role in facilitating or building diversity is: (1) to build the capacity over time; and (2) to facilitate the decision making process so that it is inclusive?"
34DChair,34DChair_131,A,"Yeah. Yes, absolutely."
34DChair,34DChair_132,Q,And creative. So it's sort of working at two levels then as the Chair?
34DChair,34DChair_133,A,"Yeah, definitely."
34DChair,34DChair_134,Q,"That's really interesting, that's great. That could be a nice model, good. So are you familiar with any barriers to managing or building diversity, apart from - implied by the Chair role?"
34DChair,34DChair_135,A,"Yeah, well when I did the Directors course, probably about five years ago now, and had to role play a number of things, and I can see how they play out, dominating Board members; people who have their opinion and don't want to change and like to throw their weight, they like to talk first and all that sort of stuff. And when those situations aren't managed, I can see how those things could easily evolve into places where Boards don't make real, proper decisions. And if you read some of the cases and some of the various things that we went through in that course, you can see how it actually did play out in those situations, with different Boards that have not operated well."
34DChair,34DChair_136,Q,"Okay, so like, the HIH crash and stuff like that?"
34DChair,34DChair_137,A,"Yeah, HIH, I was actually just going to mention that one because that is one that they actually teach during the AICD course. They actually go through that and I think you spend at least a day on it, going through what had happened at each Board meeting; who was the nominating factor; what didn't they do; what did they do; who did stuff outside the Board that was inconsistent or they didn't tell the Board what they'd done, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a whole range of things there that - you look at it and go, 'Oh my god, that's a nightmare'. No wonder they went under."
34DChair,34DChair_138,Q,"So Participant 34D, do you think your strategies for building diversity on the Board, diversity of thinking, would that have prevented some of this bad decision making?"
34DChair,34DChair_139,A,"Yeah. I think there's a couple of aspects to it. One is the internal view and the kind of, Board not thinking they had to have any external perspective, that in the HIH situation, they had it all under control, they were in command and certain people were acting in a particular way. Now, the other thing that I haven't actually experienced either, but could be an impact here, is the connection between a shareholder and a Board member. So you find where significant shareholders actually have a Board member, that Board member in my mind, is quite hard to see how they could be there for all shareholders, when in reality, they're there for their shareholder, that kind of thing. So that's an interesting situation that I've never really had to deal with."
34DChair,34DChair_14,A,Yeah sort of. It's more management consulting.
34DChair,34DChair_140,Q,"Because that happens in private equity, doesn't it?"
34DChair,34DChair_141,A,"It does. Well private equity, they're very clear about it. They basically say, 'This is what we're doing. We're running this show and we're running it.' No, but it's something that we're aware a major shareholder might have a Board seat and they're there to try and make sure that shareholder's views are the ones that the Board accepts. So it's kind of, you're not acting on behalf of all shareholders in that situation. It's hard to argue that you are. I'm sure they will argue that they are, but it doesn't feel that way from the outside."
34DChair,34DChair_142,A,"So that situation I haven't seen, but the diversity of thinking, if everybody takes it seriously, it's really hard for it not to be effective. Especially when you're doing it in terms of thinking. Where it falls down in my mind, is like where I was saying before, if you add three females to a Board and they all have personality A and are driving for financial outcomes, you actually haven't changed the way that Board works. It doesn't matter whether they are male or female. You might get a slight element of diversity by doing that, but the reality is, unless you really force diversity of thinking to be in play, then you haven't got diversity."
34DChair,34DChair_143,Q,"So given this, what about gender targets and quotas to influence Board diversity, what do you think of this?"
34DChair,34DChair_144,A,"Yeah, I think like I say, I think you do get a level of natural diversity by having different genders, different race, different religions on the Board, or anywhere, it doesn't have to be a Board - so I think you do get an element, and you do force - if it's a male dominated Board and all of a sudden half of its female, they do operate slightly differently, but you're only addressing a small component of it. You really haven't got to proper diversity of thinking. And yeah, you could get a whole Board of females who -"
34DChair,34DChair_145,Q,Think the same.
34DChair,34DChair_146,A,"- do not have diversity of thinking either. They might go the other way. They might have diversity of thinking in a particular area now, forgetting all the other aspects kind of thing. I think to do it, you have to carefully think it through. You've got to find the right people, and some people aren't the noisy ones that stand up and want to be selected. It's kind of, if you really think about it, all politicians feel the same, because only a certain type of person would stand up and make all of that noise in front of the community and try and get themselves elected, so most politicians are going to look pretty much the same. From our perspective, you're actually not getting the representation of the community in our parliaments because only a certain type of person will put themselves forward. So we're actually missing the ability to actually make our society better, by having just politicians be in there."
34DChair,34DChair_147,A,"Now the good thing is, typically there's people who really care about that go into the public service and actually influence from inside. We do get a bit of a different story going on, it doesn't quite work the way it could work. Now, corporates have - and corporations - have the ability to actually do it without all that fanfare and public debate and all that good stuff, so you can actually select a fairly diverse team to be at the Board level, as much as at your management level."
34DChair,34DChair_148,Q,"I think we're nearly finished now. There's one question, but before I ask this question, I'd just really like to ask you, do you think we should be doing something to develop the capacity of Chairs, given the important role you've really described, to develop their capacity to maximising the ability of Boards to include different ways of thinking."
34DChair,34DChair_149,A,Sure.
34DChair,34DChair_15,Q,"Management, yep. Good, well let's start. First of all, how has the composition of Boards that you're familiar with changed over time do you think - let's look at the two and a half years - in terms of diversity? If at all."
34DChair,34DChair_150,Q,"Instead of like quotas and targets for gender and stuff, should we be doing something with the Chairs, and if so, what do you think might be able to be done?"
34DChair,34DChair_151,A,"The answer is yes, absolutely. If we look at the way in which CEOs have evolved in the last 10 years or so, that's exactly what's happened. Our CEOs have gone from being the dominating decision maker, to being the leader and helping the management team make the right decisions, so they are exactly what I'm talking about at the Chair level. So yeah, the answer is absolutely the Chair needs to be that leader as well. Whether we need to do something specific for it, yeah probably. How would that happen? I haven't really though that through, but I'm sure the same way the CEOs come - or maybe it's more the case of who is the Chair and how do you source the Chair?"
34DChair,34DChair_152,A,"The Chair is that dominating decision maker, that might have been of the past, who kind of goes around the room and gets the five decisions, those five ideas, and goes, 'Right yeah okay, well we're going to decide X', that's the way maybe a CEO used to work 15 or 20 years ago as well. It doesn't happen anymore. Now perhaps it's actually naturally evolving today and therefore the leaders coming through, are recognising that they have to be leaders, a Chair is a leader, not a Chair kind of. So I think, I'm not sure what specific things would need to be done, other than recognising that that's what it should be and shareholders and ASIC and APRA and people like that, need to be doing more than just, 'Does the Board comply?' it's what's the composition of the Board; how is the Board making decisions; what's their way of thinking; is the Chair a leader? There's probably a magnitude of things that could be done to review Boards, rather than have they complied. Which is probably way more valuable than how was that decision made, or does that decision comply or not kind of thing."
34DChair,34DChair_153,Q,"That's brilliant. Well we're at our final question which I'm asking you now to look 10 years into the future, and how would you like to see the diversity of Australian Boards?"
34DChair,34DChair_154,A,"Well I think the starting point would be the role of Boards, and I would like to think that Boards are an essential element of a business' strategy in that they're bringing another dimension to the decision making of that organisation, that it helps management, that it doesn't hinder them. They don't get into the operating side of things; and that it is bringing perspectives that perhaps beyond the boundaries of today, that's bringing a diversity of experience and thinking to that organisation, that gives it a dimension that allows it to take opportunities and be more successful. I would hate to think that Boards get lost and therefore become irrelevant and therefore not used by management, or shareholders or anybody."
34DChair,34DChair_155,A,"So from that perspective, I think Boards need to continue to evolve in terms of how do they build their composition; are there specific roles for specific people; how does that then evolve into training and development as Board members take on those roles; what level of operating experience should you really have had, before you become a Board member. There are a whole range of things like that, that are important. But yeah, in 10 years time I would hope to think that Boards are an essential element of a business' strategy, rather than kind of compliance and/or irrelevant."
34DChair,34DChair_156,Q,"Wow, okay. I love it. Thank you. So different. I cannot believe it Participant 34D, it's been a great interview. Thank you so much."
34DChair,34DChair_157,A,No trouble.
34DChair,34DChair_158,Q,Enjoy the winter.
34DChair,34DChair_159,A,Okay. [laughter]
34DChair,34DChair_16,A,"Yeah, how much it's changed. Well the thing I think I've probably noticed the most is Board members originally coming in as a Board member, came in as having a long history in business usually. The expectation is therefore that the Board member would know all aspects of a Board role and I think the things that have changed, and the reason why I joined the iSelect Board, was to bring a specific capability to the Board and I think the evolution of the Board members, is to play more designated roles, rather than everybody trying to be a jack-of-all-trades kind of situation. That's probably the thing that I've noticed the most in the last period of time, is that Boards really have to be much more understanding of how the business really works. But as a Board member, it's hard to know all aspects, so therefore making sure that the Board is composed of people who can complement one another and create the value that a Board should have as a team."
34DChair,34DChair_160,Q,"Thank you again, and we'll send you an invitation to anything, anywhere where we're - so you get some sense of the outcomes of the research."
34DChair,34DChair_161,A,"Yeah, sure. No trouble and if you need to check anything, that's fine."
34DChair,34DChair_162,Q,"Thanks very much Participant 34D. Oh that book, if that title - Juliet Bourke, I mean, just her name."
34DChair,34DChair_163,A,"Yeah, 'Two Heads are Better Than One' or something like that."
34DChair,34DChair_164,Q,"Oh okay, and it was B-O-U-R-K-E. I'll find it. 'Two Heads are Better than One', that'll be enough."
34DChair,34DChair_165,A,"Let me know, I can actually just do a quick search here."
34DChair,34DChair_166,Q,I'll just turn this off.
34DChair,34DChair_17,Q,"Okay, so it's a team. What do you think might be driving this focus on each Board member bringing a particular skills?"
34DChair,34DChair_18,A,"I think business is a lot more complex these days, with keystone changes constantly changing. The technologies, they're re-arranging of business models, the evolution of customer demand, the scrutiny from Regulators and from society in general, is way stronger now than it was previously, and continues. I guess from that perspective, that Boards, whilst not becoming management, have to understand a lot more about what management is doing, how they're thinking and what's impacting the business. And if they can't trust the decisions that are made inside the business - there's significant destruction going on all over the business world which the Boards really need to understand what that means. It has various impacts in terms of somebody in the Board really needs to understand why and how a business model might need to change; and then somebody else, and quite possibly somebody else, would need to then understand, well what does that do to governance, to reporting requirements and to structures? Then somebody else might need to know what that really means in terms of the financials and how profitability would be impacted, et cetera. And it's very hard for a single Board member, in my view, to be able to cover all of those aspects, in the required level of detail, so hence they're moving, in my mind, to Board members playing specific roles and the Board team being a complementary set of skills and capabilities."
34DChair,34DChair_19,Q,"Excellent, so are there core skills that every Board needs, or is it pretty well tailored?"
34DChair,34DChair_2,A,"Yeah-yeah no, I am the Director of a couple of different Boards, but one's listed."
34DChair,34DChair_20,A,"Oh yeah. Yeah, in my view. Experience, operational business experience. If you don’t understand how businesses work and what customers need and want, and how parts of the organisation need to operate to provide those activities, then absolutely. Now obviously there is a core base level of governance and understanding of the compliance side of the world that each Director must have. Each Director must also have some financial ability to be able to understand at least what a P&L means, and how the business is operating in that sense. But I think today's Board members, need to be a lot more specialised beyond just the basic Board that might have been in the past."
34DChair,34DChair_21,Q,"Okay, so these specialised skills, are they sort of specific to the Board, or what might that look like?"
34DChair,34DChair_22,A,How do you mean specific to the Board?
34DChair,34DChair_23,Q,"Well say, would a startup, perhaps a Board of a startup might need different - you know, like there's those core skills that everyone needs, which you just talked about, but then some special skills that you might bring particular -"
34DChair,34DChair_24,A,"Oh yeah sure. Yeah, absolutely. In a startup situation, there's probably two real factors that are important: one is there's usually a general assumption, which is probably correct, that the startup founder knows the product or thing that they're trying to build, so the two factors then that are typically needed in the startup world is how to extract funding and what would be required from an investor, and therefore, how do you organise the startup to be ready for an investment, and that is a very specific skill. Then the second one is, assuming that the startup is actually starting to sell their product, how do you scale that into a mature business? And that again, is another specific skill. Now that skill is quite often also needed as you grow a normal business, so a normal other organisation, so it's not just the startup, but it is very specific to a startup, it is always needed by a startup. It may not always be needed by another Board."
34DChair,34DChair_25,A,"In a more kind of mature environment, Boards need to have a much better understanding of people, of their customers and of their technology and operating models. If you get those four aspects working together, then you ought to be able to navigate the destructing world that we live in."
34DChair,34DChair_26,Q,"So you haven't mentioned things like law, because often the Boards I've been interviewing, they've got a lawyer and they've got accountants, so you're saying -"
34DChair,34DChair_27,A,"Yeah, I think that was the past, and I don't think it is completely gone away for sure, because there's nothing wrong with having - I'm a Chartered Accountant, so part of my ability or benefit to a Board is that yeah, I do understand financial, but I've spent much more time in the destructive space, understanding how business models work and how that technology play can be adapted, used, or be a problem for an organisation. So that side of it needs to be parked there as well. Yes, there are definitely situations where - but you can always buy in legal services, it's more the ability to identify that there is a potential or a problem, to enable to actually access the expertise as required. Now if the Board was going through significant acquisitions or something, then you'd expect a Board member to have experience with that. It could be adapting a Board according to the activities of the business."
34DChair,34DChair_28,Q,"With Board diversity then, fitting in here, how important do you think that is? Let's say one is not important at all, and 10 is extremely important."
34DChair,34DChair_29,A,"I think it'd be extremely important, but not in the diversity that we probably think. I think the diversity of thinking that is the most important factor, and yes, diversity of thinking comes with normal diversity as well, so if you get different genders, you get different country of origins, et cetera, you will end up with a natural diversity of thinking. But it's probably even more important to make sure you don't have your Type A personality sitting on a Board, even if they are female and male. That quite often happens. Any successful business person has got a little bit of Type A in them, if not a lot. So being able to identify that, and even do things within a Board discussion to highlight different things that we might be thinking about."
34DChair,34DChair_3,Q,"So one's a listed Board? One listed, and the others are..?"
34DChair,34DChair_30,A,"One of the Boards - the not-for-profit that I Chair, we use a diversity of thinking story, I guess, where depending on the situation, we all try and adopt the community face, and what would the community think of what we're about to decide. Then we try and adopt a kind of financial side, and then a risk side, and then our own people side, so we're all sort of forcing ourselves to think beyond what we would normally come into that room with, and see whether or not that changes our views on what we're about to decide. We just around the table on that basis and what we've found a number of times, is it has changed our decision because we've able to see it through a different eye, we see it with different lenses kind of thing. And that's, in my mind, a diversity of thinking. Now like I said, it does come more naturally if you have different gender, different race and different backgrounds, even different religions. All of those aspects do bring an element of that to the table, but sometimes you have to force it to create that situation."
34DChair,34DChair_31,Q,"That's really interesting. How long have you been using this Participant 34D, this way of being -"
34DChair,34DChair_32,A,"Ever since I was the Chair, so two and a half years."
34DChair,34DChair_33,Q,Did you introduce that strategy?
34DChair,34DChair_34,A,"Yeah-no, absolutely. It's based on one of the partners at Deloitte that I worked with quite a bit, a lady by the name of Juliet Bourke. She's written a book on the diversity of thinking. I honestly don't know what the name of the book is though."
34DChair,34DChair_35,Q,"That's okay, was it B-U-R-K-E, or B-O..?"
34DChair,34DChair_36,A,"B-O-U-R-K-E, yeah. Juliet Bourke."
34DChair,34DChair_37,Q,B-O-U-R-K-E. I might check it out.
34DChair,34DChair_38,A,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the name. Now you've made me think. I'll confirm that for you in a sec."
34DChair,34DChair_39,Q,"Oh lovely, thank you. So you introduced this tool about two and a half years ago, did you see - you didn't see how the Board made decisions before you became Chair?"
34DChair,34DChair_4,A,"Well one's a not-for-profit, and one is an advisory board to a startup."
34DChair,34DChair_40,A,No.
34DChair,34DChair_41,Q,"Have you got feedback from the Board members, how they find it?"
34DChair,34DChair_42,A,"Yeah. Yeah, they find it good. We probably don't recognise that we're doing it anymore. We just do, we just go, 'What would our community think? Let's put a risk hat on, let's think about the risks that we're talking about here. Anybody got any risks that they would like to identify?' just picking it up within the natural discussion. But yeah, it's one of the things where maybe we should call it out more often."
34DChair,34DChair_43,Q,"I'm just wondering, is there any situation where you think you just wouldn't worry about diversity, that it's not so important?"
34DChair,34DChair_44,A,No.
34DChair,34DChair_45,Q,any types of positions or situations?
34DChair,34DChair_46,A,No-no.
34DChair,34DChair_47,Q,Nope?
34DChair,34DChair_48,A,"No-no, never. Never. But not diversity by forcing three females and three males."
34DChair,34DChair_49,Q,"No. The way you're talking about it, yeah."
34DChair,34DChair_5,Q,"Great, okay. Good, you span the spectrum for us, which is good. [laughter] It's useful given that - because I have questions, but what I tend to do is let you talk and I just tick off the questions that you answer as you go. So you can compare, you know, contrast the different situations, that would be great, while we work through these questions. You've told me how many, how long have you been sitting on these Boards for?"
34DChair,34DChair_50,A,"Yeah, it's more to get real diversity. In my mind, that's kind of a start, but if all you're trying to do is just give it an optical view, then you're probably not really making any impact because more than likely, you're choosing females who look and sound like yourself to be Board members, so you actually haven't got any diversity at all, really."
34DChair,34DChair_51,Q,"Okay, so what about social networks, do you think they matter?"
34DChair,34DChair_52,A,For Boards?
34DChair,34DChair_53,Q,Yeah.
34DChair,34DChair_54,A,Yeah. In what form? How do you mean 'do they matter'?
34DChair,34DChair_55,Q,"Bringing in different - like having diverse social networks, does that benefit the Board, that kind of diversity? So you've got people that have links with particular communities that might be useful, or countries, or industries?"
34DChair,34DChair_56,A,"Sure, yeah. I don't have any reason why not and I couldn't think that it would be a problem. It would be a benefit for sure. I think today's world, the way we kind of talk about things, there is so much data out there today that most people can't anymore, get to the bottom of the details, what might be possible. For example: if we were looking to introduce a chat bot into our call centres at iSelect, we couldn't possibly examine every option available. There's so many that we would never get to the bottom of making a decision."
34DChair,34DChair_57,A,"Today's decision world is no longer at the detailed level. When I grew up, we could go down to the detail, to the cent if you like, and check something, then verify it three times and therefore tick it off as approved. You can't do that anymore, so the behaviour, particularly of millennials who have never had the experience I've had, is to skim, skim all the data and to use social trends to verify whether or the information they're seeing is good or bad. 'Good and bad' is probably not the right words, but better or worse in that situation. So what you're actually finding is that peer reviewing and trends are important elements for making decisions, and to be able to do that, you have to be tapped into the social networks out there, so you need to be across what's going on, say in Twitter and other things like that, to be able to manage your organisation either to respond to situations which may be negative, or to take opportunities that may be positive, or even to benchmark or make a decision about which way a business should go, based on their customers who might be trending or whatever. So the need to be more socially aware than we've ever been before, is very true and on that basis, Board members can't sit back in their club rooms and ignore the external factors like that, they have to be very much across it. Does that make sense?"
34DChair,34DChair_58,Q,"Yeah, that's really interesting. It makes sense because I have this view of now, we've got this skimming, you've got to have filters, and so you're using lenses as perspectives and then you're also using social media and understanding of trends within social media to filter. So decision making is very much at an executive level, using filters."
34DChair,34DChair_59,A,"Yep. That's really because you just can't get to the data. Something like the number of - I can't remember, I think Google's probably something like this that says, 'We've created more data in the last two years than has ever, ever been created ever before.' So how could you possibly get across all of that data?"
34DChair,34DChair_6,A,"So the not-for-profit, for about two and a half years and I'm the Chair of that not-for-profit."
34DChair,34DChair_60,A,"My generation has grown up knowing that we could get to the detail. We know we can go down to the level of the cent and we can verify. You can no longer do that. When I grew up choosing a system, you'd have four accounting systems you chose between and you mad your choice of one of those four accounting systems, and you knew they were the four accounting systems you had to choose. You knew what each one of them did, you knew what the other one didn't do, et cetera. Now if you were trying to adopt some technology into your business, you have thousands of options. You couldn't possibly sit there and examine all of them to the detail we used to, or otherwise you'd still be doing this five years after the customer had forgotten that idea and moved on. So you have to adapt quickly with information that is not as robust as we probably previously had, and therefore we're using trends. It's kind of like my kids muck around with their Uber scores, they know their Uber scores better than mine and all this sort of stuff. And that's the way they're ranking themselves, according to their ranking in a feedback market."
34DChair,34DChair_61,Q,"I'm having connections in my head with Agile, because I've been interviewing some startup people who are very into Agile and it's a bit like that. It's iterative riding the wave and interpreting the signs quickly."
34DChair,34DChair_62,A,"Yeah. Yeah definitely, and they're doing it based on what's trending."
34DChair,34DChair_63,Q,"Yeah, exactly."
34DChair,34DChair_64,A,"No-no, agree. And the good startups are moving very quickly to get into the market and then are able to scale their products quickly. The challenge is, for a startup - and this is one of the things that we push very hard on when I'm  - I also mentor at Stone & Chalk - so when we're talking to startups there as a mentor, it's, 'How can you simplify your message about your product? Because if you can simplify, you can get it to market faster.' If it's contracts and you're adding more complexity, you're probably not going to get to market fast enough, so get it simpler, get the message clearer and even get your product simpler, because you're trying to do too much. If you are able to do that, then you can get to market, then you can scale, then you can actually take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace kind of thing."
34DChair,34DChair_65,A,"At the Director level, I struggle to find people who would have the full knowledge of all of that. Like, I don't understand company structures and corporate structures, I'm not a lawyer, and I would never sit in a Board room going, 'Yep, I can get across that'. I would either say, 'Do I need to know externally that this is good or not?' Therefore I'll go and get some external help, or if we've got somebody on the Board that we designate to be that person to actually inform the rest of the Board of what's going on."
34DChair,34DChair_66,Q,"So using external expertise as needed, so it's seeing the Board as really being able to pull in resources as needed, but knowing when it needs to do so is the duty of the Board, I guess."
34DChair,34DChair_67,A,"Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I guess it's probably a little bit uncommon, but back 20 years or so ago, Boards really considered the information that management provided to them, and then made decisions based on their long-term history, business history. Nowadays, you can't do it that way, you've got to also have an external view, you've got to understand what else is going on. Management may have missed something, they may have missed a trend or something, so how do you actually keep on top of that? It's not just my gray hair and experience that's going to get me there, things have changed in the last 12 months that if I relied on what I knew last year, it wouldn’t be relevant today."
34DChair,34DChair_68,Q,"Okay, and social media is an important part of that external view?"
34DChair,34DChair_69,A,"Yeah, absolutely."
34DChair,34DChair_7,Q,"That's great. As your role as a chair is really helpful too, because people have been saying, 'Oh, that's the Chair, the Chair does that' so it'd be good if we can drill down there."
34DChair,34DChair_70,Q,"Great, so now we'll move to Board functioning. We want to understand how diversity influences Board functioning, so this is probably a drill down and an illustration of how you use that tool you talked about to make decisions."
34DChair,34DChair_71,A,"Yeah, well I guess it is, it's more a conscious, 'are we considering the various aspects of it?' People will be naturally biased to a particular side effect, you know, somebody might be very risk adverse all the time; somebody might be very worried about the people aspects, or the people considerations; somebody might be worried about strategy or future or those sorts of things. Typically most business people have been taught to be outcome-oriented, so they're driven to 'What's the result? How will we get an answer? Will we make any money?' those sorts of things, and that tends to be the dominating factor in any decision. So to deliberately remove that from the room and say, 'Right, we're not talking about outcomes or results. We're talking about the risks. Let's go around the table and discuss the risks that we might see associated with this decision.' That kind of works in enterprise."
34DChair,34DChair_72,A,"Now in the not-for-profit world, your results or outcomes are not necessarily financially oriented, they're more about your society outcomes or things like that. And as a result, it's been easier to adopt it because sometimes it's not easy to see those outcomes or potential results, so if we start looking at it through the lenses of 'What risks do we have and could it meet here; what would our community think; what would our people think?' As we go around the table and talk about those different aspects, we quite often crystallise what the outcome is, so in a not-for-profit world, it's probably easier because you don't have that same P&L, shareholder value, results focus. But there is equally, a need to have an outcome that's solid and good and makes sense, and all that good stuff."
34DChair,34DChair_73,A,"I haven't seen it happen in the public company I'm in, but by nature, we tend to have taken on different roles as Board members, and the Chair is pretty good in making sure that everybody is heard, so if somebody hasn't said something, they're actually called to say, 'So what's your view?' and given, like I said, the roles that we've sort of taken, you tend to adopt the role that is yours, and that gives a fairly good, diverse view on the decisions that are being made."
34DChair,34DChair_74,Q,"So how do you know what your role is in the Board? Are you brought on for that, or..?"
34DChair,34DChair_75,A,"That's a good question, and I don't think it's been formally put in place, we haven't like you would in management team, we haven't got a CSO, we haven't got a CRO, CHRO or whatever, but it's probably just been something that people have naturally done. Now I was recruited onto the Board to bring skills in destruction and the impact of destruction and innovation on business and to make sure the Board had that view, so I probably am the one who has been given that specific role. But the Chair, I think, has probably chosen the Board members fairly carefully. One is a strong operational person who really understands how to make the business model work; another one is a strong financial person, investment banking background; and then another one is a strong legal background, so I think there's probably been - without it being public or stated - a fairly deliberate choosing of the Board members to make sure of that level of diversity, without it necessarily being spelt out, is actually there."
34DChair,34DChair_76,Q,"Okay, so the Directors backgrounds are really - that's where you get the idea of the role?"
34DChair,34DChair_77,A,"Yeah, that's probably true."
34DChair,34DChair_78,Q,"[pause] Is there any example of where diversity has contributed to conflict, like because you've defined it as - yeah."
34DChair,34DChair_79,A,"[pause] I haven't seen much conflict in my Board. I probably - [pause] yeah, I probably haven't had an experience where a Board's dysfunctional or anything like that. I've obviously heard of those stories, but I haven't been party to them."
34DChair,34DChair_8,A,"[laughs] Yeah, okay."
34DChair,34DChair_80,Q,"Has there been any - like you introduced a new tool, for example, on the not-for-profit Board, was there any resistance, or was everyone really flexible, happy to adopt?"
34DChair,34DChair_81,A,"Yeah-no, everyone was fairly - there was no pushback or, 'No, we're not going to it', or 'Why are we doing this?' We used to actually make a decision, so I think the way I probably did it made it easy, because we used it to make a decision that wasn't obvious at the time, and by using the tool, we were able to get a really good decision, so everyone went, 'Okay cool, that's good.'"
34DChair,34DChair_82,A,"What we were trying to work out is whether or not - so our not-for-profit, as a very quick background, is a charity that looks at building resilience into children, and so therefore we're actually targeting average Australia, 85% population, so 15-odd million people in families and children, to help eliminate mental health issues and perhaps drugs and other issues as children grow into teenagers and then adults. Now to get to those people, we're not talking about 15% that are disadvantaged, we're talking about mainstream Australia, so we were trying to figure out how do we do that and our vision or model was to scale by having trainers and teaching people how do it. And obviously getting to 15million people, we're going to have a very big organisation, so how could we adopt technology and the digital world to be able to make that come alive? Initially that was yeah, we can say that, but what does that really look like, and it was hard to get that picture, so we used a whole bunch of this tool, I guess, or this way of thinking, to drive out all the aspects of it, to be able to then go, 'Okay right, we can see how we can do this.' And in doing so, we created a story and then the management team have now been chugging away, delivering on that story for the last, probably year and a half."
34DChair,34DChair_83,Q,And the story was about how the service would work in the community?
34DChair,34DChair_84,A,"Yeah, and therefore how would you get the results? If we wanted to get to 85% of the population, how would we do it?"
34DChair,34DChair_85,Q,"So the causal story, yeah."
34DChair,34DChair_86,A,"Yeah. And then it's kind of well, how do you make that more tangible by thinking about it differently and taking each person in the room - and if you just sat there and say, 'Well, give me an answer', no one could give you an answer. It's, 'Well okay, let's think about now what the community would want us to do; what would the government want us to do; what would other elements of society; what are the risks associated with it; how would our team have to evolve and what would that mean for our people' et cetera. As you have all of those discussions independently, you actually progress to a much clearer understanding of what the outcome could be."
34DChair,34DChair_87,Q,"Excellent, so this is like creative problem-solving?"
34DChair,34DChair_88,A,"Yeah, it probably is actually, in some form."
34DChair,34DChair_89,Q,"Diversity has contributed to creative and innovative ways of problem-solving, or opportunity creation, whatever."
34DChair,34DChair_9,Q,I'll pick on you.
34DChair,34DChair_90,A,"Yep-yep, that's true. And you know, in a general sense, applying that in a management consulting space, you do that naturally, so this is just applying that at a Board level."
34DChair,34DChair_91,Q,"Yeah, because as you're saying, at a strategic level, this works brilliantly."
34DChair,34DChair_92,A,Yeah.
34DChair,34DChair_93,Q,"And the old way actually, doesn't work so well, is what you were saying?"
34DChair,34DChair_94,A,"Yeah, that's true. The old way is a Board full of A-Type personalities and then over the last 10 years or so, you can swap out the males and make them females, but they're still A-Type personalities. This is kind of okay, let's recognise that diversity of thinking is what we're trying to get, and yes, you can get that by different gender, different age and different religion or whatever, but there's also you probably have to manage getting the diversity of thinking working."
34DChair,34DChair_95,Q,"Okay, so I can see that with recruitment then, when you're identifying potential new Board members, how would you go about this, to build your team that is capable of exercising such diverse thinking?"
34DChair,34DChair_96,A,"So we're actually doing that on this not-for-profit at the moment. We have a Board vacancy, or our Board has space for another person. We haven't had anybody leave or anything like that, it's just we think there's another role needed now. So we've used this to say what type of person do we need? Where are we not often enough, thinking about something that we should be, and where we're missing is the - let's call them 'investors' - but the people who may fund what we're doing. We're more worried about how we're operating and how we're bringing the service to the community, we haven't got enough people - we're not often enough naturally going to, 'But what would our funders think?' so we are deliberately trying to find somebody that would come from that background, or have that thinking in their mindset."
34DChair,34DChair_97,Q,This is interesting.
34DChair,34DChair_98,A,"It's definitely - and that person would obviously then have that role on the Board. Now obviously they can contribute in any other way as well, but that's the primary reason to have that person on the Board."
34DChair,34DChair_99,Q,"Okay, so I'm seeing a benefit of - I'm calling it a 'tool' which I don’t know, however you want to talk about it, the different way -"
35D,35D_1,Q,"Thank you very much, 35D, for agreeing to be interviewed. You’re probably aware that we’re exploring the diversity of boards, and we’re looking at Australian boards. We’re seeking the understandings of people in Australia who are actually on boards, or from organisations that influence Australian boards. So it’s ground-up understanding. I’m interviewing you because you’re on at least one board."
35D,35D_10,A,"I was brought on a few years ago, two or three years ago and so when I left I was still the only female. While it’s listed it’s not a large company but I think it’s probably closer to the norm. I know some of the more prominent public companies will have more diversity because they’re more under the spotlight to have the diversity but I think that there are a lot of commercial boards still that really don’t have much in the way of diversity."
35D,35D_100,A,That’s right.
35D,35D_101,Q,"Diversity, what does that mean to you, the word diversity?"
35D,35D_102,A,On boards?
35D,35D_103,Q,Yes.
35D,35D_104,A,"Gender you’ve mentioned. Look, it is more than gender of course but we’ve got to be careful at some – I think you can get into tokenism at some point. My personal view is things like people being gay and all that sort of thing, I think that’s happening naturally, personally. It’s quite interesting. In Canberra, the number of gay advisers, it’s quite strong. I think the idea that someone is gay has become quite acceptable. I don’t see it as being – I’m sure there are times where they feel they may not be treated the right way, but I suspect that’s the same as what they find outside. This is just my view, and I’m sure they’ll bring different perspectives."
35D,35D_105,A,"Obviously, race is another one, but again, a lot of those issues I think are based on the fact that you haven’t – you probably have to apply some of the same things. I think gender has to be done first personally. I think gender has to be done first, and I think some of the literature started with gender but then got into race and sex and gender or whatever it is. I actually think you need to deal with gender first, as in as a priority because I think it’s quite hard to deal with. I believe that if that changes you’re going to have a mix that’s different and I do think a bigger mix of men and women will – you’ve got the biggest group of others in there and I believe that will start changing how they look at embracing others. I think they’re separate issues. How do we get more indigenous and others on boards? At the end of the day, they’re not getting educated yet. We’re really not getting enough through the system."
35D,35D_106,Q,It’s the pipeline issue.
35D,35D_107,A,"It’s the pipeline issue. We’ve got women, more than 50 are going through uni so if we’re focusing on boards we’re at a position there is no reason you shouldn’t have 50/50 on boards. We’re not getting 50/50 in some of the other areas yet and it’s hard to assess it any way and the problems are different but I do think once you get – if you really did make that massive change and had 50/50 or at least the women, I think some of the other issues will start moving away."
35D,35D_108,Q,"Going back to an earlier point you made that if we focus on gender so we have women, equal number of women, if women who get on to boards are the ones who have unconsciously adopted the male point of view, they’ve done accounting and commercial law, very masculine disciplines, rational, competitive –"
35D,35D_109,A,"They are the ones that are sticking around and that’s why I have a problem with it, doing it the way we are because I chose very early on I didn’t want to be – I was offered a partnership for a law firm. I didn’t want to be a CEO. I looked at their lives and said I didn’t want to do it. A lot of women are like me and just say, “I don’t want to do it.” The ones who do want to do it of course had been through the same and they’ve been through the pathway and they do become like men so we’re not changing the balance much and sometimes it works."
35D,35D_11,Q,If you were the only female how many people on the board?
35D,35D_110,Q,There isn’t diversity then.
35D,35D_111,A,"No, so it isn’t diversity. Even my mum says, “Come on, you’re a white female 35D. What about all the Muslims and things?”"
35D,35D_112,Q,Exactly.
35D,35D_113,A,That’s why I think we have to change it quite radically for it to actually change.
35D,35D_114,Q,What are we changing? Are we changing boards or society or –
35D,35D_115,A,You’re changing society.
35D,35D_116,Q,The pipeline is society.
35D,35D_117,A,"I suspect it would be a bit tokenistic initially in the sense that people would be – like [Stuart]’s been, he visited Deloitte and they really did have an aggressive policy of promoting women over men. It makes the men very angry and it’s partly I don’t think they’re educating them well enough. They don’t realise that they’re just feeling what other people have felt. Morrison said, “We want to get equality but let’s not have anyone suffer. No one can miss out. This is not equal some game or something,” he said. I’m going, “No, it is actually.” I don’t see how it could happen but I do think you do need to change society. I think we’ve got more chance of it happening in politics than we have in business even though I still think that’s quite tough."
35D,35D_118,A,"If 35D said okay we’re going to go 50/50, you’d actually start seeing a lot more movement and that’s where it really needs to happen because they can change it. It’s actually a bit hard. It is a bit rough to tell a company you have to have 50/50 because at the end of the day it is their business and it is their shareholder’s money. They answer to the shareholders. We’ve designed them not for social purpose. We’ve designed them to make money."
35D,35D_119,Q,Commercial. Do you see that as an either/or? Some people see corporate social responsibility as a better sustainable commercial enterprise.
35D,35D_12,A,Six or seven.
35D,35D_120,A,Yes but you pay lip service to that too.
35D,35D_121,Q,This is what I was wondering.
35D,35D_122,A,You pay lip service to that too but that’s a whole cultural thing. It’s about how we bring up our kids.
35D,35D_123,Q,What do you mean?
35D,35D_124,A,"These boys that become CEO, they’re there to win in the football team. They’re to win this and they’re to win that and they’re really not there. Yes, they might go and send something to an auction to make some money for a charity. That’s tokenistic or there to help them. I don’t think we’ve gone beyond that yet."
35D,35D_125,Q,This is social change and targeting men in that competitiveness.
35D,35D_126,A,"Though I do think women, if you really did get 50/50 but not the way we’re going because I agree with you, it doesn’t look like diversity if it’s just the ones that get through the current system. If you do get 50/50 and you really do get a mix of women, not just me then you will – because I am seen as quite, I’m quite commercial. I’m definitely not used often. There’s a big spectrum of women on one of the other sides with me. But if you really did that, if you could imagine a world like that then I think we would change a lot of things. I think the companies would change because you’re going to answer, everyone’s going to answer for something broader."
35D,35D_127,Q,"Do you think the younger generation – I’ve interviewed some younger people in their early 40s, probably their early 40s and they were in a start-up context but they were very passionate about social, the organisation as being part of a bigger system, social, economic, ethical –"
35D,35D_128,A,I think that’s right.
35D,35D_129,Q,"They were really trained to develop products and services that would work with that system of course and value-add and environmental footprint, social footprint. They were using this, I mean you say token that –"
35D,35D_13,Q,So you’re under the 30% target.
35D,35D_130,A,"No, I don’t say that’s token. I think there a lot of people – in my era that really wasn’t a viable thing but I do think there are a lot of people trying to get both ways, to get a business to make money but also to do it in a social responsible way. I’m not sure we’ve worked out how to do that very well, as in some of the, what’s environmentally friendly and that’s usually a lot of, a bit cynical."
35D,35D_131,Q,I know.
35D,35D_132,A,"But that aside, I do think as I was saying, the younger generation does have a – we’ve got five kids. They’re all early 20s and there’s a mix. I think the way I would say it is they’re more socially aware. There are some who started business but their number one aim is to start a business but they know that to attract their market and their positioning is one that’s environmental and it does make them feel better because they’ve been brought up with a very leftist view to how they sell themselves, that is a bit cynical but it’s a bit true. It is true. There’s more hope with some of the younger generations than there was with mine because we didn’t even get taught anything about social responsibility. I do think it will happen like Hearn over in New Zealand for example."
35D,35D_133,Q,Amazing.
35D,35D_134,A,Those sorts of role models will have an effect. It was evidenced by Tanya. We’re miles from that. I don’t blame her at all but it’s –
35D,35D_135,Q,That’s sad.
35D,35D_136,A,"I know her quite well. She’s not actually that good. The one we should have got was Nicola Roxon. She was brilliant, but see, she was like me. She looked at Rudd for five minutes and goes, “I’m getting out of here.” She’d get me a bit longer than that. The good ones leave. Someone like Hearn over in New Zealand, a great role model. If people step up – some of the younger women are quite good too. Some of them, they are amazing because they didn’t – I’ve got one daughter. We call her post-modern girl. They don’t have the same inhibitions. They don’t walk around with that same sense of, I’ve got to better looking, a bit this and a bit that. They’re just much more self-assured."
35D,35D_137,Q,"It’s lovely, isn’t it?"
35D,35D_138,A,I think they’re all fabulous signs and that’s why it needs to happen.
35D,35D_139,Q,"Even with that ray of hope, I wonder if in a global – you’ve worked in a global context. The social footprint is not just Australia, not just local. It’s a bit ill-defined and it could be somewhere you don’t particularly care about. The globalisation problem for larger companies do you think that’s perhaps an inhibitor to the social responsibility idea, your 20 year old?"
35D,35D_14,A,They were under pressure for that.
35D,35D_140,A,"Globalisation obviously worked against any what I call unique solutions I think. If Australia wanted to do something different it would be quite hard because of its global pressures. On social responsibility, we’re still very strongly led by the US and that’s a problem at the moment. The bigger issue for boards is in fact what my husband lectures on, and that’s disruption. It’s the whole – like your [unclear] 00:42:40 and all the rest of it. They’re crucifying local businesses. Now we’ve got Amazon, and they’re going to make it really tough, and so we won’t actually have that many boards, because the businesses won’t survive."
35D,35D_141,A,"I think it is the movement to global businesses that is actually a real thing. I think a lot of other countries are better than we are. I do think we are a bit of an outlook in terms of our culture. I think our culture if we – you know how I always talk about boards not working together but as a country we are. It’s actually quite a small country. It’s very easy to – the world of politics is small, the world of business is small. If you’re in one or the other you know everyone. That doesn’t happen in the US or in Europe."
35D,35D_142,Q,Because they’re big.
35D,35D_143,A,"They’re much bigger. There’s a lot more competition. It’s tougher. In Australia, you will get a job as a CEO if you’ve been in the Fin Review, even if those things you’d been in the Fin Review are bad because you look at some of the CEOs and once they get the job they haven’t succeeded. They’ve just been in the Fin Review a few times, a bit more than a few times but they’ve got a name and they’ll blame something else. I’m not sure whether that’s a context of globalisation but I do – in some ways I think globalisation will force boards to pick up their game."
35D,35D_144,Q,But it shows that Australian boards are influenced by not just our organisations and institutions that we’ve been interviewing but the broader –
35D,35D_145,A,"But as boards I think we actually possibly are too isolated as boards, not as businesses, as boards."
35D,35D_146,Q,Does that affect diversity on boards?
35D,35D_147,A,"Yeah, I think the capability of our boards is quite low. I think if we were in America or Europe, the competition for the board positions and the expectation of board behaviour and things would be a lot higher."
35D,35D_148,Q,Really? So we have lower expectations?
35D,35D_149,A,I think so. I think the standards in our boards are pretty low.
35D,35D_15,Q,Do you think those targets are effective?
35D,35D_150,Q,Is that a cultural thing or is it legal framework?
35D,35D_151,A,"It’s a small world. It’s a small group. You’re not there by merit. You’re there by whether you know someone. There are a lot of people with a lot of merit who could do a lot but they’re not the ones in there because you don’t want anyone to ruffle the boat, rock the boat too much."
35D,35D_152,Q,It’s the culture of not valuing conflict and robust debate.
35D,35D_153,A,I think we’re still isolated. I think we’re pretty backward in the development of board skills.
35D,35D_154,Q,Did you do some board development work over in the States or something like that to –
35D,35D_155,A,"No, but I’ve worked – probably just being exposed to companies and the executives. I’ve been to a lot of conferences and things and I suppose what I see. Because I haven’t sat around their board table, it could well be just good PR."
35D,35D_156,Q,True. You haven’t been one of their members.
35D,35D_157,A,"I’m also probably influenced by the fact that it is a bit of a club here. Our political club and our company club, it’s all a bit of a club."
35D,35D_158,Q,"We’re so small. That’s an interesting structural fact. We want to know how diversity influences board functioning. Can we talk about bullying conflict, how that process is managed? Problem solving, how decision making might be facilitated by diversity?"
35D,35D_159,A,"How could it be managed? First of all I think you need, chairs probably do need a bit of training. That might be the way to start because ultimately it’s the job for the chair to pick up culture. At the moment a chair sees his role as keeping sweet with the CEO and the board as higher. They don’t necessarily see it because they’re – I said something to CEO and he said, “Look, you’re strong enough. You can deal with it.” That was the answer and because you’re tough you can deal with it, not, I shouldn’t have to deal with it. If I were a shrinking violet and this guy behaved the way he did, someone may have reason to be more –"
35D,35D_16,A,I think they are effective in a sense that at least it caused them to think about it. It doesn’t ever get reported who I was with or anything? It’s actually de-identified?
35D,35D_160,Q,To rescue you.
35D,35D_161,A,"To more rescue me, right? But if you don’t need rescuing you fight your own fight. It’s just the way they position you. “You don’t understand x or you don’t understand y or whatever.” I’m going, “I do actually. It’s just I have a different view.” But it gets positioned in a particular way and I think you need the chairs, they need to see this as their responsibility. Not many board members are actually going to complain about bullying. I’ve never complained about any bullying. I live with it all the time. But if say for example it was a clear responsibility of the chair to deal with it that might change it."
35D,35D_162,A,"Because if some women started being a little bit, I might not do anything about it but then other women will and if it was seen as – if the chair lets it go and it’s their responsibility to deal with it, then maybe something might start happening. But then I recognise, you’ve picked it up pretty quickly. They’ll come to your rescue. That’s exactly right. It’s demeaning. A lot of women play that role quite effectively and I don’t mean it in a negative way. I’m just saying that’s the way it works and men love it. They feel really good about it."
35D,35D_163,Q,But then it’s a game.
35D,35D_164,A,I think the only thing you can do is bring it back to the chair.
35D,35D_165,Q,"That idea then the chair, we can cultivate the chair role that might be something."
35D,35D_166,A,"The other thing we did was when I – my first board meeting at this company we got letters from an employee claiming sexual harassment or something. It was against another employee and then she wrote a few other people. It was my first meeting and I said, “Look, this is actually quite serious. We can’t just let it go.” This lady was the head of their legal department too and I said, “We need someone independent to come in and to nip this one in the bud.” She’s not an easy person to deal with, because I did suspect the woman itself is a big part of the problem, but I could also see there were a lot of problems already in the culture, that I’m going, ‘Hmm, I think she’s going to have a pay day. It’ll become a mess very quickly.’"
35D,35D_167,A,"So we got an independent guy in. He was brilliant, and so there are people out there who – because I’ve put up with so much for so long, because I had a patriarchal father, you gave as good as you got and you worked out how to play that game. But having access, and more ready access – this guy – [inaudible] 00:50:40 didn’t cost that much in the context of what boards spend. He came in. He had a very proper process. He interviewed the relevant people. He documented the thing. He came back to the board. He spoke with them. He gave insight into – he used organisational language. He could explain it in a way normal people can’t explain it. He could see exactly what was going on and we need more of that rather than go straight to the courts. Look so and so should pick up bullying. That’s not going to be very helpful."
35D,35D_168,A,"But this idea that maybe it’s seen as more – AICD is trying to do this but the idea that it is seen as good practice to get people to come in and assess these things and the AICD is promoting some of that stuff. Not necessarily focused on bullying, more focusing on the broader role of the board which is not necessarily, it’s not a bad thing. But I do think having external influences, maybe boards have to get reports done on their own behaviour, that sort of thing."
35D,35D_169,Q,On their functioning.
35D,35D_17,Q,It’s de-identified.
35D,35D_170,A,"Yeah, because I think it will come out differently."
35D,35D_171,Q,"It’s like 360 but with an observation and observer as well. That’s good. Have you seen conflict because of diversity, how it was managed, how it was disruptive?"
35D,35D_172,A,"I’ve always been the token female. I’m a token female. I wasn’t a token female in a lot of boards so I generally didn’t have conflict and even this one, I didn’t let it get to conflict. I just decided I didn’t like that behaviour. I never stood up to him. We talked about the issues at the board. I never ever called him out on anything. I never did, and I never would. It’s just not my personality, but I could have. If I was a different person, I would have. Because he was [appalling] 00:52:43."
35D,35D_173,Q,"What about the problem-solving, the decisions made? Your voice then was not heard."
35D,35D_174,A,"No. This particular guy, what was it? Then we started interviewing – he said, we had an employee that came in a senior manager and she really left us an alert. We just got that she got cancer and she’d had it before. It was a reoccurrence. This guy was so angry because of course the sales and everything went down. She’s head of sales. “Now I’m interviewing them all and I’m asking them whether they’re sick and whether they’re this and whether they’re that.” I said, “I’m not sure you can do that. Maybe you’re not allowed to ask those questions.” “I am. It’s my right” then that’s when this other guy backed me. I don’t know what happened at the end of that. I suspect he still asked the questions and we are still potentially liable. So it’s like, here a conflict. I’ll put it forward but I –"
35D,35D_175,Q,It’s passive resistance. You’re just –
35D,35D_176,A,"I table it and if you’ve got a good, we actually had a good, one of the good things is to have an independent company secretary because if you – he didn’t record everything. He was quite a good professional company secretary and that helped a bit."
35D,35D_177,Q,Because it’s documented.
35D,35D_178,A,"First of all he documented but also he wasn’t totally silent. Some of these things, I think might be a bit right. Because our chair was so weak it didn’t quite work, but it was a real help to have an independent [unclear] 00:54:31. First of all, you’re talking about a personality type that’s possibly closer – and I know I’m being stereotypical myself, but maybe more that he’s not the entrepreneurial stereotype of some of the males. I’ll put it that way. It was a guy. He’s bringing in a diverse view because he’s a different style of individual, and that was actually very helpful."
35D,35D_179,Q,"That’s different approaches to decision making, to thinking. It’s cognitive diversity. That’s seen as a very interesting way of thinking about diversity."
35D,35D_18,A,"The problem is most boards actually don’t realise they have a problem and they don’t know how to fix it because the main reason I left was culture. One of the guys was a bully, a total bully and the chairman of course doesn’t pick it up. They just don’t realise how patriarchal they’ve been. They just don’t realise it and so I do think the targets are important because you get them to look at it. There’s no easy answer but it’s very hard, particularly – see, in larger organisations, if I say [Stuart] 00:04:12 was at Deloitte, they’re having it drummed into them. The guys are having it drummed into them all the time, diversity, diversity, whether they like it or not. Gradually they sort of work it out, most of them but in organisations where they just don’t have that infrastructure and they don’t have that commitment coming from the top, I think it’s very hard for those cultures to change."
35D,35D_180,A,It’s just putting things in a way that are – you’ve got to work with what you’ve got. That worked for us.
35D,35D_181,Q,That was a process person whereas you are all outcomes.
35D,35D_182,A,"It’s really different and because he was independent and we employed him as an independent person, he brought a sub-skill. He could talk about how other boards did things and it was good."
35D,35D_183,Q,"Another thing because I’m aware of the time, how were new board members recruited?"
35D,35D_184,A,I was the only one recruited at that time in that particular company. Poorly.
35D,35D_185,Q,I love one-word answers. It’s someone who knew someone.
35D,35D_186,A,"I was the one who asked for the financials. I was the one who asked to go and speak to them about them, to understand a few things. They didn’t even know what insurance they had so I had to go and have a look at it and told them, “Actually it’s not very good. You better fix this.”"
35D,35D_187,Q,You were selected because someone knew you?
35D,35D_188,A,I knew the CEO. I was big for them in a few ways. I was a female. I was on the advisory board for Digital Health and worked in this sector for a long time. I knew their customer base so I was someone they would always want.
35D,35D_189,Q,You were an attractive card for them and you wouldn’t know how they typically recruit because –
35D,35D_19,Q,"I’ll put this to you because I’m 27 interviews in. This idea of inclusivity, of being able to include people, inclusion so it’s a cultural thing and a role thing as well that’s been coming up, how important is that to having a diverse board? I think it’s interesting that you said you left because of culture and a bully and patriarchy. Is that a lack of inclusion, a lack of capacity?"
35D,35D_190,A,They didn’t bring people in very often.
35D,35D_191,Q,Do you think that not having a turnover is a problem?
35D,35D_192,A,"Yeah, I do because even when I was leaving, one of the other guys who’s been there, the nice guy actually, he was putting his hand up again and the others have been there for donkeys. I think there should a forced turnover. That would actually a bit – in fact I think it would help the diversity because you’d get the question each time."
35D,35D_193,Q,"Exactly. Did anyone external to the board influence the criteria for selecting members, like recruitment people?"
35D,35D_194,A,A lot of companies I had spoken to when I’ve been looking at board positions they definitely use external. They’re not necessarily the norm.
35D,35D_195,Q,Even in that commercial?
35D,35D_196,A,In the commercial I think for me – I don’t think they believe they needed a new director. I think they wanted a female because they need to get that done and they thought I would bring stuff and the guy knew me so I don’t think it was because they were looking for another person. But I do think it is more common for people to use a professional head hunter or recruitment companies and they would provide advice without trying to lose their job.
35D,35D_197,Q,I’m going to go straight to the last question.
35D,35D_198,A,Sorry.
35D,35D_199,Q,"No. You’ve been brilliant. Don’t worry. Looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity in Australian boards?"
35D,35D_2,A,"I’ve just resigned from a listed company, x, and then the others are more advisory, so I’m on an advisory board to a University. I’m also on an advisory board to, I think it’s called an advisory. It must be an advisory board to a government board regarding digital health."
35D,35D_20,A,"They don’t realise it. If you go out to dinner with them it’ll all be all about World War II. They just don’t realise. One guy was nice. He is a sweet guy. He’s a gentleman. There are men who know that role. He was very respectful and in fact was probably one of my bigger allies because he’s been on some other big boards so it’s probably – he’s a bit more open. He’s an ex-politician too so he was more aware. A lot of them really, particularly the entrepreneurial type, they’ve never been stopped. They go home to their wives. There is a particular role they play and no one’s pulled them up. They clearly haven’t got strong daughters otherwise they would have pulled them up."
35D,35D_200,A,"Of course I’d like to see it changed but I truly don’t want – as you say, I don’t necessarily just want to see women capable of playing on the AFL football field. I’m actually quite concerned about that because a lot of my ask was about what the kids – having four daughters, what’s the world going to be like for them? It really concerns me that this idea of having a child as opposed to it just happened somewhere and we’re supposed to have everything equal so that’s important. I don’t have a sense of a – I don’t believe there is a design in their minds of what they’re looking for. They’re quite confused because they are starting to believe that having a child is something that will jeopardise their chances or if we do have a child that shouldn’t influence my chances of something."
35D,35D_201,A,"At the end of the day, I think children is a key part of being a female and having children and bringing them up well is a key part of our social responsibility. I do worry about that however there are quite a lot of – I don’t know how we’re going to make it work but there are quite a lot of good things happening too. Men are taking maternity leave but I think it comes back to, it’s all about what we want and everyone wants everything and they want what everyone else has got. So we want maternity leave, we want this and we want that but we’re not willing to give anything up because we think what we’ve got is precious. We’ll probably have some bigger problems to worry about though. Unfortunately, we tend to respond to big change. When things are shaken up a lot, we tend to respond."
35D,35D_202,Q,I always wonder if that’s because we haven’t made the little changes.
35D,35D_203,A,"That’s exactly right. A lot of problems go away. It’s like individually, you get cancer. A lot of other problems go away, don’t they? We are like that as a nation, and I don’t know that we can do much about it. I think it’s part of our human makeup. There are some leading lights, which, if we got – my idea would be we’ve got some really good female leadership in Canberra, and in fact I was thinking before the last election, there were a few women starting to realise what it was like and unfortunately, they hadn’t stick together. There was a group of them and if they had stuck together – they were picked off. If they had stuck together and actually told a cohesive story you’d actually get a party up."
35D,35D_204,A,"Once someone says, “It’s okay. Yes, that’s a bit better” but boy, I’m not sure they’d get the numbers though. I even talked to my mother and she goes, “No, we should just be quiet and let things happen.” I think we’re in the minority in thinking this is an issue and that we need to focus on it. Even a lot of women don’t support it."
35D,35D_205,Q,Gender diversity?
35D,35D_206,A,Yeah.
35D,35D_207,Q,"On boards and other kinds of diversity, like different ways of thinking, different perspectives?"
35D,35D_208,A,"I don’t know that many people even have their eyes opened to it. If you look at the majority of the population it is not something on their radar. It’s an elitist issue. It’s not what they’re worried about. Why are they going to worry about what these rich people are doing on boards? My mum used boards, we were having this debate and she used boards as an example of rich people or something. I said, “Do you know how much they’re getting paid mum? It’s really not a high-paying job generally.” But people have this perception that’s someone else. It’s the 5%."
35D,35D_209,Q,People just ignore them.
35D,35D_21,A,"It’s hard to get to those places. At the end of the day, I think they suffer for it as a business but I’m not sure that’s the right question because ultimately to be a really effective board you do need diversity and they do suffer as a business because of it. I had to help them with quite a few things that they were really struggling with because they didn’t see the problem. They had some bullying internally and things like that. I had to represent the board to help them with those things because they didn’t know which way to turn."
35D,35D_210,A,I don’t think that’s where the change is going to come.
35D,35D_211,Q,This is a bit depressing because there’s the –
35D,35D_212,A,I know I shouldn’t –
35D,35D_213,Q,No.
35D,35D_214,A,I do think we can do stuff though and I think there – I’ve changed things. I created the community service obligation in pharmacy. I actually do believe it can change but it’s going to take some women prepared to take it on and really work together. I think it could happen. I do think there are women around to do it. They’ve got to do it.
35D,35D_215,Q,That’s women getting together but you’ve also mentioned there’s legislation that can really help.
35D,35D_216,A,That’s right.
35D,35D_217,Q,We’ve got a regulatory framework that needs to happen.
35D,35D_218,A,"We’ve got to look at the issue. You’ve got to unpack feminism in a different way. This isn’t feminism. This is about diversity and I think that is the angle. It’s not about my right to have what some other men. I actually don’t have a view that we should have equality for that reason. I don’t have a view that any of us have any rights at all. I have a view that it’s about what is better for us a country or as a society. I have a view we’re all related and we should look at ourselves as one big race. I think diversity is better for that and I think that’s the language that’s got to start coming out, rather than some of the other laws we’ve got coming out, about politician [unclear] 01:03:59 and things like that, the class wars, we’re going the opposite direction. But I do think there is –"
35D,35D_219,Q,"Your philosophy of ‘We’re all one big race and it’s not rights because that fragments us into an individual focus’. It’s a collaboration, and that is against this individualistic competitive way of thinking, and that’s socially and commercial, in business, on boards, whatever."
35D,35D_22,Q,It’s interesting because the board was bullying and then the organisation –
35D,35D_220,A,"It is possible now, with the Internet because the global movements of women and other people and it’s just women, people who pursue diversity – there’s Hooks I think her name is. You’d know her from the US. Bell Hooks I think her name, she talks about this intersectionality as her form of feminism and I totally agree because it’s not just about – she’s still looking at it from that point of view but I think there are a lot of people really doing some good work on collaborating together. They haven’t worked out how to do it because none of the people will agree to something but I do think Hearn, she’s a good role model. If you had someone like her, a few people like her in a few good locations say the US, and a few places in Europe or something you’d start getting quite a different focus."
35D,35D_221,Q,"A very different world. That’ll be a powerful role model, a powerful [signal] 01:05:44 to the market as well."
35D,35D_222,A,"I think that’s probably what we need, because you can’t actually change it from within. It’s like I do with industries. You’ve got to bring a lot of people along. They’ve got to have a story that’s about what’s the better world and then you need to basically bring people along but you’ll need money and support to get rules changed and other things to make it happen."
35D,35D_223,Q,It’s multilevel because you’ve got meta ways of thinking. That’s good. That will work. That will help us a lot.
35D,35D_224,A,That’s good.
35D,35D_225,Q,Thank you.
35D,35D_226,A,You’re welcome.
35D,35D_227,Q,That’s great.
35D,35D_23,A,"The board’s behaviour is the same. The board’s behaviour was exactly the same, not all of them but men don’t pick up other men."
35D,35D_24,Q,It was tolerated at the top.
35D,35D_25,A,"Yeah. They know how to get the power and keep the power and I think a lot of women go, “I just can’t be bothered.”"
35D,35D_26,Q,I met a male start-up and he said he would not go for a board position if there were not a number of women on there so lack of diversity.
35D,35D_27,A,"It was more someone had been on my back for a few years and eventually I said why not? If I want to go into boards I might as well get the experience. That was really my thinking and I was quite open. I didn’t go in thinking it was a wonderful board or anything, but you got to the point where that was not worth it."
35D,35D_28,Q,I understand.
35D,35D_29,A,"Generally, I’ve actually changed my views. I think [unclear] 00:08:20, long-term, actually are really important."
35D,35D_3,Q,Health records?
35D,35D_30,Q,Really?
35D,35D_31,A,I didn’t have that view before but I do have the view now.
35D,35D_32,Q,So what changed?
35D,35D_33,A,"I suppose recognising I don’t believe it’s actually going to happen. While some of the bigger boards do have more women on, they still really often – there are some exceptions. There are some strong women but across the board the numbers are skewed because so many women are given the more female-appropriate roles or there’s not more than 50%. You definitely don’t have – if it is something that would split on gender and a lot of things do because it’s how you would approach something and how much you can – in a board if you want to have a conversation often it’s you’ve got to tip toe around."
35D,35D_34,A,"You got a CEO putting something forward and you go, “How about we have a conversation about x?” You can only get that conversation really going if first of all, you’ve got enough people who say, “Yes, that’s a good idea” and secondly, then there’s enough people with an adept thinking along those lines to have that conversation. You need more than a few women to do that. It has to be a much – at the moment we really are going to struggle with that for a long time in my view."
35D,35D_35,A,"One of the things that I – I’ll go and get it if you want. I did a project this year. I said at least this is what you do. I wanted to work out how far have we got on gender. I have a view that the Financial Review is the paper that reflects who’s moving the power around. I went through, and analysed the female-versus-male split. And I’ve got it, and it’s outrageous. The way women are presented is always next to a man, holding a man. They’re presented as others, you’d know what that means. Or women get used to speak for the CEO when it’s on a difficult issue, where you need more sympathy, or their advisers. There was very little – and it was during the election period, so you had quite election coverage as well, where you do have a stronger representation of women, not good enough. We have stronger than we do in business, and that came through."
35D,35D_36,A,"But if you looked carefully at the articles where the women were getting a lot of airplay, it was because they were talking about women. It’s about talking about the issue of gender and it was just startling. Even the journalists, I thought, if you look at the Fin Review of journalists, chief of staff male, is assistant, female. The next level, male, assistant –"
35D,35D_37,Q,Female. So there’s always a female underneath probably doing all the work.
35D,35D_38,A,"Like Tanya Plibersek. So my view is that unless we actually force a change I don’t think we’ll ever get to do it by the way. But theoretically, I think it will be very hard to get there without forcing a change which is sort of sad because we’ve actually got to make those places, places that women want to go. What we’re doing at the moment is you’re sort of like me. So you’ll be on a board and it’s not where you want to be. You know it could be done better. They had looked through a particularly lens and the culture is the one that’s being defined."
35D,35D_39,A,"I can go and play in their culture but we need to change it. For everything to do better we need the culture to change and the only way we can do that is in fact if you actually get the numbers a lot more equal. That’s why I actually think, I don’t think we have a choice. I think we’re going to have to go the slower way but I think I’ve actually come to a view that I support recruiting women over a man even if theoretically she may not be as good because often the criteria has already been established through some precedent."
35D,35D_4,A,Yeah. I’m on the consumer advisory committee for that.
35D,35D_40,Q,Through a male lens.
35D,35D_41,A,"When you’re a bit older and you look at what business has done or not done, all they’ve done is go around in circles anyway usually. They worked out how to make money as they go around in circles which is great. We keep everyone employed. I don’t think it’s going to make that much difference. If someone’s theoretically 10% not as good I just don’t – because I don’t believe the criteria upon which people are assessing who’s better or worse is right."
35D,35D_42,Q,This then comes to recruitment strategies but we’re moving away through the paper.
35D,35D_43,A,I’m sorry.
35D,35D_44,Q,"No, it’s good. I think I better hold back to, focus on –"
35D,35D_45,A,Just get me under control.
35D,35D_46,Q,"That’s good. How would you rate the importance of diversity, 10 extremely important, 1 –"
35D,35D_47,A,10
35D,35D_48,Q,Do you feel that it’s always been that important?
35D,35D_49,A,I think it’s always been that important. It’s just that we’re actually able to talk about it now.
35D,35D_5,Q,That’s interesting.
35D,35D_50,Q,"It’s been given a language. When did this start, this language for talking about it?"
35D,35D_51,A,"It’s interesting. I read an article by Otner. What’s her name? Sherry, Sheryl Otner, 1974 I think it was written. It’s just beautiful and it talks about women from nature and men – it talks the basics of how men create a culture and women are connected to nature. It’s well written at a time that was quite early and I do think the 70s was probably about when – it will say when my mother couldn’t get a house in her own name. She couldn’t get a loan before that."
35D,35D_52,Q,"There are a lot of laws in the early 70s like divorce, fault-free divorce."
35D,35D_53,A,Everything.
35D,35D_54,Q,"Welfare, single mothers, stuff like that."
35D,35D_55,A,I think it’s Sheryl Otner. It’s worth a read actually because it’s such a – here it is. Is Female to Male as Nature is to Culture? What she does is try and analyse that and look at different cultures to work out whether or not that is a proposition that holds true. She does not value judgment but it’s really quite good.
35D,35D_56,Q,Women culture and society.
35D,35D_57,A,Because as a female I am actually proud of our connection to nature to be honest and I think that’s what is at the heart and why I think it’s so important. Because I do think we are different and I’m proud of it. I don’t want to be the same.
35D,35D_58,Q,"Do you think that – so, that’s education – sorry, that’s research, that’s academe. It has shaped feminism, the feminist movement. Are there any other [unclear] 00:15:49? You mentioned targets, so regulation."
35D,35D_59,A,"There’s not much regulation. I suppose there is the anti-discrimination legislation, which obviously is supposed to protect – and protecting women’s jobs after maternity – I think the laws that allow women to work when they had children, which is going back to the ’60s, which then goes to having maternity leave and the rights when you come back. To be honest, I think it’s the maternity leave arrangements and the idea that a woman was entitled to keep her job and have a job when they had children, I think that’s probably the turning point."
35D,35D_6,A,"Because I retired from my full-time work last November and up until that time I was on a lot of boards but a lot of them are associated with government, et cetera. The main commercial one which is what I understood was one of the things you were looking for, was Xwhich is a listed company."
35D,35D_60,Q,That really links to this feminism of the 70s.
35D,35D_61,A,"By the way, on feminism I would never have said I was a feminist when I was working. I wouldn’t have said it. I wasn’t even thinking about it because you only survive by not thinking that way. I’d never even thought about it."
35D,35D_62,Q,Because you’re marginalised?
35D,35D_63,A,"Yeah, because I was very successful. I spoke to one of my male colleagues recently. I said, “I’ve decided I’m declaring I’m a feminist” and he says, “We’ve always known that.” He’s open minded of course. The see me as a feminist because I’m a strong woman but I had never ever in any way acted like a feminist as such because I’ve never ever believed I was because it was seen as such a negative positioning. You wouldn’t employ a feminist."
35D,35D_64,Q,"That was a shame but you’re right. It has brought a language to critique how we think, how we behave and how we could relate to –"
35D,35D_65,A,I do think there’s a big distance between that sort of thinking and what’s going on in our corporate world. The corporate world is still about equality. It’s about women should be able – I relate it to Australia rules football. They’re saying you can get on the football field and start playing. There’s no girls going over there. You can come and play on this Australian rules football. See how much you like it. You can play. We’ll measure you up against the blokes and if you’re as good as them you can come on the field. That’s sort of what it’s like.
35D,35D_66,Q,"But that’s not questioning the rules, who set the rules."
35D,35D_67,A,That’s right.
35D,35D_68,Q,That’s the meta-question.
35D,35D_69,A,"I think we are going there. One of the antidiscrimination, the lady who runs that who’s the head of that, she’s brilliant and she was talking about it. They’re doing a lot of work on trying to unpack. She gave the example of the trams where for years they couldn’t get a female tram driver even though they were allowed because none of them would apply. They had the antidiscrimination commission look at why. So they came and they gave them some ideas. They put out an ad. They got millions of applicants and now we have female drivers. It was not that you weren’t allowed. It’s because they didn’t realise what they were presenting was not something women wanted to do."
35D,35D_7,Q,"We are but given you’ve got the experience of both, I had another informant who he had both and it was really useful to compare and contrast but we do have fewer people on listed companies. That’s true. First of all, how have the composition of boards that you’ve been associated with changed in terms of diversity over the years?"
35D,35D_70,Q,Interesting. We need to do a similar thing with boards for example because I’m going to come back to our research focus.
35D,35D_71,A,"I’ve done the AICD. They have the advanced course where you live in. I did that and to be honest, that wasn’t bad. It was quite good on the subject of the difference between commercial and non-commercial actually because you could tell the difference between the participants. It was quite different. But I do think through that, I think that sort of education is very good but I don’t know that a lot of people avail themselves to it."
35D,35D_72,Q,A lot of people I’ve interviewed have – they didn’t say they did one where you – the intensive one.
35D,35D_73,A,"You’ve got the basic ones but then there is one where you actually become a board member and effectively they create a company and you have your other colleagues. You actually go through a live one week of living with it so it’s a whole year in one week. It is quite good in one week of recognising the benefits of other people’s styles. It was quite good, because you do – I’ve always worked in the corporate world. A corporate board wasn’t far off that, and I was company secretary for McEwans when I was 30, so I’d been involved with boards my whole life."
35D,35D_74,A,"But I had not been exposed to not-for-profits, not the sort of people I was coming across there. I was always more connected to business. I walked in, and I go, “Oh my god, really?” I shouldn’t say that. I was as bad as it looks. I really was. There wasn’t a commercial bone in most of them, and they were into all this airy-fairy stuff, and so I sounded exactly like the blokes. But after a week of it, you actually got to appreciate the benefit of having that diversity."
35D,35D_75,Q,Of thinking?
35D,35D_76,A,"Yeah. People I turn my nose up at, not really but you know, you did –"
35D,35D_77,Q,You felt inside.
35D,35D_78,A,"They would have been marginalised in a corporate board. They would be but when you put – to get them together. First of all, the one interesting thing is I rose to do the financials which I would never have done in a corporate board because I’m always pushed down. I’m an accountant. I still wouldn’t do it. The blokes they take that on and so I took that on because I was one of the more commercial-minded so I got an option to do something I wouldn’t do. But then I also got to see what some of the others could do and the way they looked at some issues, I wouldn’t have looked them that way and it was good. So I do think that sort of exposure and possibly, they don’t design it for that purpose really. I suppose that’s mixed purposes but that sort of thing is good, that idea of cross fertilisation. It’s not just about you learning the rules. It’s you getting that benefit of working with other people."
35D,35D_79,Q,"And from different backgrounds, ways of thinking?"
35D,35D_8,A,"The one I was on, I was on to become the female."
35D,35D_80,A,"Some of the thinking about what the roles of the boards are, because a lot of boards aren’t across the role of the board as a strategic body either. They’ve got governance down because they have to but they haven’t got the strategic side so getting closer to what a board could be and how it could work, that was also very good."
35D,35D_81,Q,"Because I’ve heard people talk about the link between management and operations and the board and the importance of, because that’s like a pipeline. It may not be for that particular board but if women and people from other backgrounds don’t get the experience at the executive level then it’s hard for them to get on a board because they don’t have that experience that’s considered essential."
35D,35D_82,A,You really need to have a senior executive experience to get on a board.
35D,35D_83,Q,"Yeah, because that’s where you learn strategy. There’s one thing here, do you think – you see it as very positive and I like the way you’re talking about the different people coming together and making decisions at that AICD weekend or whatever. Do you think that there’s any situation where that kind of diverse decision making is a situation where it’s not useful? It’s just a waste of time or effort."
35D,35D_84,A,"That particular week you did have that because what happened was it was very intense and unreasonably direct and so there was a point which I said, “We have 10 things we have to do.” The board had to do 10 things in about 10 minutes and I just piped up and I said, “Look, there is no way we’re going to do that at this rate so I’m proposing, I’m going to take these four off with those three people because we know something about that and do that. You do the other things.” Even within that week, it forced those who did gibber around a bit to work within constraints. So yes, I do think it tested in fact exactly that."
35D,35D_85,Q,"Maybe when we’re talking about board functioning, that kind of process would be really important for people, for boards."
35D,35D_86,A,"There is cross fertilisation in terms of some of the networks. People know everyone but they’re all too busy. They’re not really talking about how they operate on a board. They’re too important for that. But if there was some sort of, if there were some cross fertilisation sideways, so you have the AICD as one thing but at the moment it’s also a cultural thing. I represented the industries to government so my job was bringing industries together. My view was you are stronger as an industry than doing things separately and so I always had competitors in the room. There are clearly things you couldn’t do but there are a lot of things you can do. In fact our meetings, because they were cross fertilised, meant because they came to our meeting so I was pretty tough on them and then they would go back to their boards and that would improve their boards."
35D,35D_87,A,"That’s through industry association but I do think that if boards were seen as a more sideways collegiate group, if there was some sort of sense that boards cross fertilise sideways without the competitive issue because it comes from that corporate structure. It’s a legal entity and so legal entities are like us. The theory is it’s individual but we don’t as individuals try and do it all ourselves. We work in groups. Companies don’t and that’s partly because they’re so scared of A triple C, the trade practices. But there’s a lot you can do without worrying about that and it’s a bit like the difference between a board working as governance and a board working strategic. There are a lot of things they can do but they haven’t – no one’s really facilitated it but there is a lot of opportunity for boards to work sideways."
35D,35D_88,Q,You mean sideways –
35D,35D_89,A,"Cross collaborate and they have effectively AICD things and they’re more seen as, you’re not going to a school. There is no reason you couldn’t have something where current board members once a year were going off to do something."
35D,35D_9,Q,When was that? When were you brought on?
35D,35D_90,Q,Or within one industry perhaps like the –
35D,35D_91,A,"Even cross industries it doesn’t matter. One day someone will think about it but I do think you need that cross fertilisation across boards because we couldn’t do it as individuals. What companies are doing, they’re just sitting within the legal framework that they’ve been given and then the business framework of whatever they’re trying to do and who they’re competing with. Then they’re trying to do it alone and obviously they’re trying to cross fertilise within them. But you’ve been on a board a few years. You’re no cross fertilising much are you? You’re not mixing it up in a way that –"
35D,35D_92,A,"Even ideas like the board’s role and responsibility as a citizen, subjects like that. Now I AICD is doing quite a few of these things but most people don’t really have time so it’s about that combination isn’t it? It’s got to be something people feel they get something out of. It is a cultural thing. It’s a bit like the difference between our adversary system in law and the system over in Europe where the judge’s role there is to find the truth. But here, it’s a battle between two parties so it leads to a different behaviour and we don’t have that collegiate approach across companies."
35D,35D_93,Q,"But we could if we model the EU, do they?"
35D,35D_94,A,In fact apparently in Germany they’re doing some work on it. I don’t know enough about it but someone was mentioning it the other day that they’re doing some quite creative things. You will see a lot more in Europe where they see the companies as having more social responsibility.
35D,35D_95,Q,One of the researchers here is very much into the European model.
35D,35D_96,A,"I do think there’s probably a lot to be said for having a look at some of that, particularly a lot of – it’s very adversarial and I think we’re working out it may not be the right way."
35D,35D_97,Q,It’s just the way it’s been done.
35D,35D_98,A,It’s the way it’s been done.
35D,35D_99,Q,Very masculine from a rational point of view.
36D Chair,36D Chair_1,Q,"Okay. So Participant 36D thank you for agreeing to participate in the research and for sending the consent form, that’s brilliant. First of all, can I just check your background. Is it finance?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_10,A,"I guess it was happening the previous couple years and [Nicholas] had assumed a larger empire within Macquarie and therefore – so, for example, I was representing Telstra as an advisor and then I had authority to basically offer to them that we would partner with them in large transactions. Which was not something we’d done five years earlier or three years earlier, but it just sort of emerged as a – we would put balance sheet money to work next to a client. So, it made for a very interesting dynamic. Some clients saw that as a positive and some saw it as quite a threat. That we were basically saying you either partner with us or we’ll do it without you or with somebody else. But Telstra took it pretty well, for example."
36D Chair,36D Chair_100,A,That would be a good synopsis.
36D Chair,36D Chair_101,Q,"Beautiful. We want to model, we want to develop a model. This sounds pretty good. Great. Okay. Now we’re going to look at board functioning. And you’ve been chair, plus director, so you’ve got multiple different experiences. So, how does diversity influence board functioning?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_102,A,"I was just thinking about those examples, like I said earlier, where you –different personality types. If you had too many introverts, you can have a board that the chair virtually leads it through and the agenda in no time, because people are just nodding and saying, okay, that sounds good, yes, I approve, I agree.  On the other hand, if you have a bunch of ego maniacs, extroverts, who are wanting to be heard on every issue, then that can sort of shout others out or lead to a, where are we going with this. Everybody wants to have a say, even if they’re actually building on other people’s points, et cetera. So, that’s really, it’s really important, I think, to get that culture in the group developed where people, even if they don’t start of right, they gradually come to sort of understand that we’re going to be a group that listens to each other. That builds off each other’s points rather than just ignores them and makes their own."
36D Chair,36D Chair_103,A,"I had a little bit of experience yesterday where I felt one director was really dominating the day. And it was almost like too much caffeine. Just did strike me that one of the other directors said very little, possibly as a result. Just sort of okay, you keep going. It struck me on a relatively small board, that wasn’t ideal. We got what we needed to get done. But it wasn’t the perfect day. Sometimes you come out of a board meeting and think, gee that went well, I really did a good job there today. And it’s not really you as the chair, it’s just things worked. Other times you walk out and you think that was sort of a little odd, but we sort of got there. And other times you think that was a disaster, we shouldn’t do that again."
36D Chair,36D Chair_104,Q,"So, when you say you get there, what do you -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_105,A,"When I say get there. When you feel like, you go in with a perception of these are the big issues we’ve got to really deal with today. Sometimes there’s not much, but other times you think, God, how are we going to cover all this, we’ve got so much going on. And to come out afterwards and feel like, okay, maybe not everything, but we really did, made real progress. We’ve got a real plan now or we’ve got comfortable with what we’re doing there, et cetera. We now understand what management have been doing. They’re finally got us comfortable that that’s the right strategy, et cetera."
36D Chair,36D Chair_106,A,"I think, for me, a good board meeting is one where you’ve – and it might not always be the issues that you go into the meeting thinking are the big ones, you actually learn about some during the meeting, they can emerge. But it’s that feeling of making real progress on those and that you're on top of it. It doesn’t mean that you’ve solved them, but you know you’ve got a plan for them. I think the worst feeling is coming out and saying, shit, I know there’s a whole bunch of issues, but I don’t know if we’ve got whether these plans are adequate. And now I’ve got to start thinking about, can we wait for next meeting or I do I need to actually organise a teleconference and start chatting amongst the other directors and work out what we've got to do, to then have another chat with management. So, I think they’re the two extremes for me. Because I’ve had both of them quite a few times this last year. So, I’ve had nights where I just lay awake, I can’t sleep after a board meeting sometimes."
36D Chair,36D Chair_107,Q,"Now, this is interesting. You’ve got – some people have mentioned outcome thinkers and process thinkers, as being a source of diversity as well. And you’ve mentioned both. So, the plan that addresses all the issues that have emerged as an outcome. And a process is like understanding the issues emerged, that’s sort of process work. So, are both equally important, are both important as diversity contribute to both or?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_108,A,"Yes, I’m sure it does."
36D Chair,36D Chair_109,Q,"Sorry, did that – is that synopsis, does that work for you, does that make sense?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_11,A,"It led me to doing a big project looking into a big acquisition in Europe, where we said we’d put money next to Telstra, 49% or 51% whichever way they wanted it. It might be all Macquarie money or it might be some pension funds, the Canadian pension funds were very large. Now a lot of the Australian super money would probably have filled that gap. What happened was, Telstra, you might remember, were going through that T3 period. There was a lot of to and fro with government. They were in favour and out of favour. And they decided they couldn’t do this big European deal, it was a multi-billion dollar deal. Government wasn’t supportive and they were still their major shareholder. So, we ended up doing that. I moved to London and ran it. We just did it with other private money, if you like, or non-corporate money, small pension fund money, et cetera."
36D Chair,36D Chair_110,A,"Yes. I was thinking, just trying to – I think it is – I’m a big believer that you do have to be outcome focussed. There’s no doubt about it. Just feeling like you’ve got a good process but ignoring the fact that you’ve got a deadline -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_111,Q,Absolutely.
36D Chair,36D Chair_112,A,"But equally, you can’t just keep looking at deadlines and have no process either. Because people need to have, I think management teams want to know how good the board process that they need to address, et cetera. They need some direction in that regard. We did a budget process yesterday, and I think the management team really liked the fact that they all got to come in and present their own budget, their part of the budget to the board. Rather than just hand it over to the CEO and he talk on their behalf and maybe make compromises and so on, without their involvement. So, that was a good process. Other times you feel that was a lousy process and it’s not – so, I tie the two together. That’s why I’m struggling with the question because I think that you can, but you’re less likely to get to good outcomes with a poor process. And so, it’s an end in itself to have good process."
36D Chair,36D Chair_113,Q,"I’m thinking process thinking, as a style of thinking."
36D Chair,36D Chair_114,A,Okay. It’s probably the semantics. I’m probably thinking about it the wrong way.
36D Chair,36D Chair_115,Q,"You’re talking about board process. So, this is – I’m not a board person. So, you’re automatically thinking board process – oh right, okay. It’s good."
36D Chair,36D Chair_116,A,"Some boards do have very different processes, where a lot of the decisions are made outside of the room and you’re almost rubber stamping. I don’t think that’s regarded as good process by most people, because you’ll have decisions that people are responsible for under the law, but they haven’t had real input to. Or even necessarily a good level of understanding. Because it’s already come into the room where a subcommittee has sort of, committees have their roles, but you still need to bring the board along."
36D Chair,36D Chair_117,Q,"So, conflict on boards arising because of diversity of the board. Have you had any experience of that?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_118,A,"Well, yes. I think, that example I started with, with this fellow that was playing a very particular role on the board. He was an executive director, and that was a point of disharmony too. Because he wasn’t really sitting in the company, he was arguably, he was providing those services from a distance, if you like, and nominally an executive director. And he had experience and expertise in an aspect that others of us on the board did not have. But it did become a source of dysfunctionality because he would just say, “Trust me” and “I know this. ”"
36D Chair,36D Chair_119,A,"Whereas others would take that as an opportunity to softly say, look my experience in this area, without saying you don’t have any. They’ll just say, “I’ve done a fair bit in this space, that’s really where my focus has been for over a decade now” and “My experience working with both government and private sector and small and large, is this” and that can be really helpful. People get comfortable and they sort of say, well I’ve only done a little bit of it, but you’ve done a lot and what you’re saying makes sense. So, you buy into it. Or you say, well your experience is sort of at a particular level and I need to – but it does seem to me that a lot of it is the human, the communication style and just whether the individual has got that innate ability to work as part of a team."
36D Chair,36D Chair_12,A,"That was sort of the evolution of my career through Macquarie and I spent four years in London doing sort of non-infrastructure private equity. Because Macquarie had done a lot of private infrastructure deals, which you would say were private equity, but they were of that particular class and then we branched out. And then there was a family driven move to come back to Australia and not really my preference. But that proved quite fortuitously timed because the GFC hit."
36D Chair,36D Chair_120,A,"Some people, dare I say it, should have played a few more team sports or involved in team activities. It might not be sport but some people just grow up doing solo things and they never really seem to be able to mesh into a team. And I think that’s as big a – I did the AICD course last year, and which I had been gunna, gunna do, because I thought it would both add and refresh bits that I already knew, but also add to my knowledge. And that was a big, big point being made that it’s the people that you get on the board with that’s the biggest bit of due diligence. Learning about the company’s one thing, but your fellow board members is fundamentally, much more important."
36D Chair,36D Chair_121,Q,And that’s where we are now. That’s what we want to ask. We want to explore that. How you -
36D Chair,36D Chair_122,A,Good segue.
36D Chair,36D Chair_123,Q,Exactly –identify potential new members.
36D Chair,36D Chair_124,A,"We’re doing that right now. Had dinner on Monday night with a potential new board member. On paper, outstanding. And I’m really delighted that after the dinner, I feel the personality fit would also be very, very good. It’s a person who has quite a celebrated career as a CEO. You’d recognise the name, I suspect, for a smaller company he would be a good catch. And he gives diversity, I think. Definitely, quite a different background to my own or any of the other directors."
36D Chair,36D Chair_125,Q,"So, you’re the chair of this?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_126,A,I am.
36D Chair,36D Chair_127,Q,"So, the chair having dinner with a potential new member -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_128,A,"Well, actually the whole board did."
36D Chair,36D Chair_129,Q,"Oh, okay."
36D Chair,36D Chair_13,Q,Yes. I was wondering where you were then.
36D Chair,36D Chair_130,A,"It was an interesting one. I know it’s going to be treated confidentially, but in this instance, this company is a founder entrepreneur who then, in the pre-IPO stages, when I invested, asked me would I join the board and then asked me if I’d be the chairman. But in a funny way, he still likes to think he can pick his board. And I don’t think you get to pick your board as CEO. To me that’s not the way it works. Now it might be if you still own half the company. Because if so, in that factor, you can sack the board and appoint whoever you like. But when you’re actually now quite a minor share, sub 10% shareholder, you don’t get to pick the board. And really the board picks the people to approach to come onto the board or a group of shareholders get together and say, well here’s our ticket, we’re going to vote for this ticket and you’ve got a real rebellion on your hands. Or they do it in a sensible manner with the current board or something. But I don’t think the CEO should be the one picking his board."
36D Chair,36D Chair_131,A,"Having said that, we are all living interstate from where the company is based. He thinks he needs a local director. He did bring on a very good local director two years ago, two and a half and we lost him to a very senior role in government interstate. Couldn’t stay on a private board or a private sector board. So, he scraped to that person who remains good contact with him and said you buggered us up by leaving who can you help find for us that would be in your general mould and also bring the right skills, you know the company well enough now. And that was how this came about."
36D Chair,36D Chair_132,A,"I’m not too critical, but I was a little – when we got two years ago with the first guy, he said would you come over and meet this guy over dinner and it was sort of the CEO introducing me to a potential new director and I liked him and I thought he would add enormous value. He had great credibility, relevant sector expertise, and so on and networks. So, it was not hard at all and then the rest of the board met him. This time it was sort of like, one of the other board members had already met him on a previous trip. And I felt like I was – it’s an interesting dynamic. When you push back on a CEO as a chair – and we had a rough patch. The guy that I had to move on, was very close to the CEO. And there was this -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_133,Q,"This is the same board, we’re talking about?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_134,A,"Same board. Some misplaced loyalty through a director. And all the other directors agreed he had to go. And the CEO finally got there– MD, I keep saying CEO, but he’s the MD. So, he’s on the board. So, there was – it takes its toll on a relationship. The bruising’s fading and we have good chat and it’s all ostensibly fine. But there’s this -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_135,Q,It was tough.
36D Chair,36D Chair_136,A,"Yes. He felt like I really forced his hand. It suited the other director to make me the bad guy. I was the one driving it. Funnily enough, it was, if anything, the other directors were more -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_137,Q,But you’re the chair.
36D Chair,36D Chair_138,A,"Yes. And so, he just decided – there’s lots of background to it, but he decided, it was easier to have one bill and then everybody be the bad guys."
36D Chair,36D Chair_139,Q,"So, this is a small board?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_14,A,"So, that really made it much less appealing to stay in a large investment bank, to me. I was coming back anyway, it was a real juncture. So, I just stepped out to do my own thing. I ended going back, funnily enough, and doing some advice work for Telstra under my own steam and then with some other clients. But it’s evolved towards now helping, I’ve helped a few companies raise capital and I’ve then ended up sitting on the board of a couple of those companies. And I’ve ended up doing more stuff at the small end of the market whereas at Macquarie it was all very large, big corporate clients."
36D Chair,36D Chair_140,A,"Well, relatively small. We had six directors and we lost two to job changes that they just couldn’t stay on, on a public board. So, we’re back to four, including the MD. And we want to have at least a fifth member. And ideally, we think one in Adelaide, because that is where the company is based. There is a little bit of parochialism. And we’ve had support from the government and it’s sort of good for them to see another senior Adelaide figure on the board. It plays well. I’m not so big on that, unless that person has other – you want more than just being seen -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_141,Q,"Skills matrix, all this sort of stuff. I’m not hearing 00:52:47"
36D Chair,36D Chair_142,A,We did do that.
36D Chair,36D Chair_143,Q,"Oh, you did do that?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_144,A,"Yes, we did. We did a skills matrix and we looked at the gaps. And for me the South Australian bit was low on the pecking order. I wanted relevant industry knowledge and networks and expertise. Maybe the stage we’re at, challenges were facing, growth. Some people have generally only worked in a multinational, they’ve never known what it is to be short of capital."
36D Chair,36D Chair_145,Q,They’d have no idea.
36D Chair,36D Chair_146,A,It’s a really different set of challenges. They look in horror that you’ve got nothing got in the bank.
36D Chair,36D Chair_147,Q,"Yes. You’re insolvent. So, okay. Do you feel that tensions can arise in the board selection process between on the one hand getting that collegiate fit and on the other hand avoiding group think?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_148,A,Yes. Yes.
36D Chair,36D Chair_149,Q,And how do you manage that?
36D Chair,36D Chair_15,Q,"So, you’ve got both, you’ve got experience of both. But from a board perspective, a director perspective in the start-up area."
36D Chair,36D Chair_150,A,"I think just by, and I don’t think I’ve always been very good at it, but I think, being better at it lately. I’ve really worked a lot harder this last year or two, at really trying to invite as chair, try to remind myself to be aware of the body language in the meeting and just to keep an eye on the eyes and if people look like they’re a bit sceptical or a little bit, not fully bought in or they want to make a point but they’re sort of waiting for the moment, try to draw that out. So, I think more likely you end up with group think if the chairs rushing things through and/or not shifting the conversation around. So, someone is not allowed to dominate it for too long. And I think that’s part of the skill for a good board. And that shouldn’t just be the chair, by the way. I think that’s -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_151,Q,Everyone.
36D Chair,36D Chair_152,A,"-@ everyone’s got a responsibility there to speak up for themselves and/or notice, to sort of Say, “Excuse me Chair but I think Rob wants to make a point” or Betty or whatever. I think That’s where you can avoid the group think, where you’re really inviting, does anybody see it differently. rather than are we all agreed. I think the way you couch questions and you invite that moment of difference. where, it’s not a bad thing, I’m saying, it’s Okay to see it differently."
36D Chair,36D Chair_153,Q,"So, the communication process on the board is, your strategy for avoiding group think, employing the person or engaging, recruiting the new member, is really about what they bring, the [collegiate fit] or around skills."
36D Chair,36D Chair_154,A,"So, I think, I don’t think you have to have someone that’s just, he or she is very pleasant and lovely to have dinner with and I think we’ll all have a laugh and be nice, nobody will ruffle the feathers, far from that. But do you want someone who’s a total arsehole, no. Because it makes meetings. I have another board, I won’t go into too much detail, but where there’s a background there and somebody was formally chairman and it wasn’t working and they stayed on the board because they’ve got a significant stake in the company. And they’ve never got over the fact in ten years, that they were the chair and they’re not anymore and they’ve just been difficult forever."
36D Chair,36D Chair_155,Q,Are you chair of that?
36D Chair,36D Chair_156,A,"No. And we tried and the chair is a very capable person. But he’s been a must better chair and is quite capable of taking care of himself, so we don’t have to protect, because that would be sad. But equally, there is an element to which we have to be – because we don’t want to lose that chair, because we’ve got a good chairman. That’s not about diversity there, that’s just about somebody just taking every chance to point score."
36D Chair,36D Chair_157,Q,"It’s an example of the bad dynamics. And it’s not just the chair, it’s the culture of the whole board. As a chair, do you cultivate that culture on your board?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_158,A,"Try to. Yes, and as I say, I had that real problem of one guy who would sort of undermine, I think outside of the meeting, and so on. “Well you know why he’s saying that, because he doesn’t want. ” It wasn’t something I wanted to do, to have to move someone on, but eventually it became really black and white."
36D Chair,36D Chair_159,Q,Are there any regulatory barriers to moving someone on from a board if its listed?
36D Chair,36D Chair_16,A,"I’ve got a bit of that. And I’ve sat on family boards since I was about, well a university student really or finished my law degree. Because my father had his own business, right through from the time he was a teenager or younger. So, as he hit retirement, or he sold out, he had an investment company and he asked a couple of us to sit on the board for him. It was more of an advisory board, at the end of the day it was his money and we knew where the decision making lay. But he did decide that he had a few kids that had been well trained and he would get the best out of us. So, we sat on that board and then that evolved into a business with my brothers. So, I’ve had a reasonable sized tourism or sorry, really more hospitality and leisure business that has had tourism assets. That’s been a sort of 20year board experience too, in a private company sense."
36D Chair,36D Chair_160,A,"Yes. There are. It’s a real challenge. It wasn’t obvious. This person – I better not go into it. But just made it relatively straight forward. Relatively they could have really sort of stuck their oar in the water and made it such that we had to actually at the next, call an EGM or wait for the AGM or something. But it’s a bad look for the company. Nobody thinks, oh isn’t that great, they’ve moved a director on. But it’s sort of – some people will say well if they had a problem it’s good that they addressed it. But most people would go it’s not a good sign. So, it's much better if you can have that relatively calm transition where somebody just leaves for family reasons or career reasons."
36D Chair,36D Chair_161,Q,Like we have in the media.
36D Chair,36D Chair_162,A,"Luckily this guy, there was an issue there, there was a compromise to be struck this year, if you need the company to. And we thought about it long and hard to make sure it was in the best interest of the company and we were comfortable with that. But it was, that was the condition, the quid pro quo."
36D Chair,36D Chair_163,Q,"So, it is possible, even for a listed company, to do this, the way that you’ve described it."
36D Chair,36D Chair_164,A,"Oh, look, we were lucky. He put himself in a corner. And it made it possible. I really feared I was going to have another six months or more."
36D Chair,36D Chair_165,Q,"And regulation, do you think gender, targets, quotas, those sorts of things help with diversity? Is more regulation needed?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_166,A,"I actually do, because I look at the Liberal party and the Labour party and that sort of to me, I know it’s only a sample of one instance, but it’s living proof, the Liberal party just keep – my partner works as being a ministerial advisor in the Liberal party and she also does media commentary when she’s not being – she’s just left again. After the election, she’s had a couple of offers to stay, and she does not want to. And one of her pet hates of her own party is that issue. And it is one of the issues where she will in the media make that comment quite clearly, that targets aren’t working. The quota and she can elaborate on the point much better than I. But there are simple reasons in politics that women, those that do choose to have children, those key years are when the guys are going to all these branch meetings and winning the brownie points and they can’t do some of that stuff. And then there’s all those things that have been stacked on. And they’re gradually sort of evening up. But it’s not there. To say, oh the women can – they don’t get the seats that are the safe seats and so on."
36D Chair,36D Chair_167,A,"And then she talks about why [Kelly O’Dwyer]01:01:00 would leave in exasperation with the boy’s club and so on. And [Kelly] obviously bit her tongue a fair bit on what she was quoted and she’s never really said that’s completely untrue. But some of those comments about the boy’s club and all that. So, I think in corporate –to translate across – the problem with doing that do boards. It’s one thing at parliamentary level, I feel like with boards and some of them are four and five people, we’re four at the moment. To mandate there’s got to be at least 33% women or something like that, then we have to have two out of the four. And would that be right. It might be, but it’s a lot harder still in some instances, depending on what industry and so on."
36D Chair,36D Chair_168,A,"So, it’s a pretty tricky one and you actually sort of just putting the bar too high, but I think there needs, there probably does need to be a quota and there maybe just has to be really sophisticated nuance thinking about the size of companies and so on. I think major, the top 50 without a doubt. It would just be shameful to be sitting there and saying we couldn’t find a woman to be on this nine person board or seven person board, in this industry. That’s pretty hard to believe. But is it three women out of seven, as a minimum, I don’t know? I haven’t thought about it deeply enough to, but I do believe that quotas are probably part of the answer."
36D Chair,36D Chair_169,Q,"So, when you were talking earlier, you talked to define that it was you were after cognitive diversity to achieve risk mitigation and value creation. Is the gender quota, what’s it got to do with that, the gender target – how is that going to contribute to this, which is cognitive diversity?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_17,Q,Okay. Good.
36D Chair,36D Chair_170,A,"Well I think there’s two aims here. Maybe I’m out on a limb. But I think there’s one that’s good for the company and the shareholders and everybody involved the company, the employees and other stakeholders. And then there’s what’s good for society. And what’s just overall sensible. I think those two melt into one another to a fair degree. But I don’t think it’s necessarily all about just saying what’s good for the company. It’s really what sort of society we want to have."
36D Chair,36D Chair_171,Q,And you want to have a society that gives women a fair go.
36D Chair,36D Chair_172,A,"Well I think it should be, yes, women, and it should be minorities and it should be a whole lot of -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_173,Q,"So, that’s where the demographics come in."
36D Chair,36D Chair_174,A,"I think any guy with a daughter, should just look through that lens and say, how would I feel if my daughter is sitting there at Freehills. She’s a very capable girl, she has high honours degree, she’s got a masters now that she did in London before she started at Freehills. Why should she sit in the back row because, as my partner says, “No vagina is required here. ”It really irritates her. And I get that. I try to imagine what it would be like to be sitting on the other side of that fence and how frustrated I’d be. You’re watching people less capable, but it’s just they happen to be born with a penis."
36D Chair,36D Chair_175,Q,Exactly.
36D Chair,36D Chair_176,A,Or whatever.
36D Chair,36D Chair_177,Q,"Or gone to blah, blah, blah."
36D Chair,36D Chair_178,A,Or they had white skin instead of brown skin or something. Or they just happened to be born in this country not – therefore you might not look to be the right mix for us.
36D Chair,36D Chair_179,Q,Final question. Ten years from now. How would you like to see diversity of Australian boards?
36D Chair,36D Chair_18,A,"So, I’ve had a range, from Macquarie I sat on a number of large boards but they weren’t public company boards, they were Macquarie investment vehicles and things. So, we had a five billion dollar, in terms of enterprise value, was chairing two five billion dollar companies. I’ve also had pretty extensive vehicles. I’m now chairing a couple of companies that – well one is a small listed tech company that’s market caps ranging between 40 and 80 million depending on the day of the week. But then I’ve got a little start up business. We’ve just bought, I’ve done a management buyout with an old friend. I helped him out and he asked me if I’d chair that and invest in it. And that’s sort of worth, I don’t know, 15 million dollars. And another one that is worth, well we don’t know whether it’s worth anything yet, but we’ve put money into it, with one of Melbourne’s big billionaire families. So, they’re bringing a good discipline to it. So, it’s a real range of things."
36D Chair,36D Chair_180,A,"The best answer is, we wouldn’t even be thinking about it, because we’re sort of there. So, that’s probably my base answer. I think 10 years, that’s not going to happen. I’m just being a realist, not because I don’t think it’s a good thing to aspire to. I just don’t think we move quite that quickly. Having said that, I reckon, I look at women’s sport and I reckon, the progress in women’s sport in the last ten years has been extraordinary. So, you do get inflection points and all of a sudden a couple of things happen. And if you told me how many girls would be playing AFLW, or junior levels of that, I would have laughed and said girls don’t want to play, there’s a tiny minority of girls that want to play football. Most of them they want to play netball and basketball and soccer maybe, but football no, my daughter wouldn’t want to play, therefore I assumed no other girls did. And I was totally, totally wrong."
36D Chair,36D Chair_181,A,"And even the number that want to play cricket surprises me, less so. And those sports, particularly the women’s cricket now. I'm still amused that they’re referring to the Ashes, the Ashes don’t start for another two months, but they’re talking about, they don’t say the Women’s Ashes they just say –maybe it’s because I listen to the ABC. But it is interesting. The mindset shift, therefore, it could happen in a corporate world, a slightly different one. There are so many women in the professions at senior levels now compared to – when I started at Minter Ellison, there was one partner, one female partner, but it wasn’t a huge partnership then, it was probably 13 or 15 or something. And then they merged and they merged. When I left four years later, there was still only a very small number of female partners. And then I’m back there as a client a number of years later and I’m looking at the letterhead and so on. A lot more female partners. It’s been a rapid change in a sense."
36D Chair,36D Chair_182,Q,"The last two decades is that, you’re talking?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_183,A,"I would say the last two decades. And probably gaining pace, I would say, I don’t think its losing pace, or I don’t think it’s linear. I think it’s been slightly been a -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_184,Q,"What’s stopping it, what’s stopping it then? What are the main barriers?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_185,A,"To female. I don’t know whether it’s stopping, I think it’s just not moving as quickly as it should."
36D Chair,36D Chair_186,Q,What’s holding it back?
36D Chair,36D Chair_187,A,"Yes. I don’t think culturally we’ve probably come to grips with the true sharing of parenthood. I think that’s a big part of it. And maybe I’m oversimplifying it and there’s a whole lot of stuff for women that aren’t having children as well. But I think it still ties back to that. As my partner and my daughter were discussing the other night [Christie]01:08:35 says there was also this assumption that even if she wasn’t having children, that she might. She might go and have a child and therefore, better choose a guy because he wasn’t going off on maternity leave. It’s safer."
36D Chair,36D Chair_188,A,"Certain countries have been – Scandinavian have probably been the leaders in this, it’s very progressive policies. But the Canadians –I had an old friend in here yesterday, a younger guy. He’s – what’s Alex – in his late thirties and his wife be mid-thirties. And she’s got a senior job at [Lululemon]01:09:08 in Vancouver in their head office. Big marketing role. She’s taking – they’re having their first child in a couple of months. She’s going to take three months off before the baby. She’ll take 12 months off after. And she might take a few more after that. Because the Canadian and the corporate, it might be partly their corporates, I don’t know how much is Canadian law versus their corporate policy. But that sounded extremely flexible to me compared to what I think would be available here."
36D Chair,36D Chair_189,Q,Absolutely.
36D Chair,36D Chair_19,Q,"Well this is fabulous. If you can think, I’ll be asking you questions, but if you can say, well if it was this situation, that, because it might vary and be good to know if-"
36D Chair,36D Chair_190,A,Is that the barrier? We just need to gradually see that as a much more equal sharing of raising children.
36D Chair,36D Chair_191,Q,It’s certainly a role of New Zealand Prime Minister. Her husband is holding the baby.
36D Chair,36D Chair_192,A,"Well one of the women that started with me at Minters switched to Allens Arthur Robs, she had four girls. Her husband was a landscape gardener, I believe he still is. He raised the four girls. She’s had a big corporate career. She’s now CEO at Tiger Airlines. She went through years at Virgin as corporate counsel and then ran one of the divisions and then ended up running Tiger, [Merren McArthur. ]01:10:19"
36D Chair,36D Chair_193,A,"I had a partner at [McKinsey] I worked for, she wasn’t just making partner,[Alison Watkins]01:10:27 who is head of Coca-Cola Amatil. [Alison’s] husband has largely raised their kids. And there are a handful like that. But it’s the fact that I can rattle off a few examples, I’m not struggling to think of examples. There is limited number in the pool. There just probably needs to be a bit more of that. That’s a big cultural thing, turning the Queen Mary I suspect. It’s not like the male Australia wakes up one morning and says, we ought to do it differently."
36D Chair,36D Chair_194,Q,"But anyway, you’ve talked about the different kinds of diversity like for the decision making and all that. And you’ve talked about the culture of the board as being an important part there."
36D Chair,36D Chair_2,A,I’m trained – I did undergrad in law and commerce.
36D Chair,36D Chair_20,A,"Well I thought it would be worth elaborating on that background, because it is quite a mish mash of different stuff. It’s not the sort of – some of my colleagues are sitting on a handful of big corporate boards, but they don’t touch small business much."
36D Chair,36D Chair_21,Q,"Absolutely. And then we tend to then work between interviewees, but it’s really good to have the same person reflecting across. Plus, you were around with the GFC so, you can talk about how that might have influenced things as well. So, how many years does it span then, that you’ve been a board director?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_22,A,"I suppose it’s probably 30. Early stuff was, as I said, advisory board. And I sat on school – my old school asked me to come back and sit on the board at probably a pretty tender age. I think that’s probably, not 30 years, but 25 years. More than that because it was before I went to business school."
36D Chair,36D Chair_23,Q,How many do you currently sit on?
36D Chair,36D Chair_24,A,"I was trying to count that up when I was thinking. I’m sitting on – probably, if I just group some, because they are a group of boards that are related and you almost have the board meeting back to back. So, if I just took them as groups, I’d say there’s six, that are sort of corporate boards."
36D Chair,36D Chair_25,Q,Six corporate.
36D Chair,36D Chair_26,A,Only one listed.
36D Chair,36D Chair_27,Q,One listed. Beautiful.
36D Chair,36D Chair_28,A,Probably about three philanthropic.
36D Chair,36D Chair_29,Q,Of the six?
36D Chair,36D Chair_3,Q,Law and commerce.
36D Chair,36D Chair_30,A,"No, separately."
36D Chair,36D Chair_31,Q,"Well, let’s just put lots. It says, how many boards have you sat on? But it is, it’s lots."
36D Chair,36D Chair_32,A,"In terms of past, there’s a lot. Because it’s just been part of my life with Macquarie, for a number of years there representing Macquarie on – there were some that were much chunkier and more relevant though. There were two big ones when I was in London, which were quite mature."
36D Chair,36D Chair_33,Q,"Amazing. Amazing experience. Thank you so much. I can see why Paul grabbed you. So, first, how has the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed over time, in terms of diversity?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_34,A,"That’s pretty clear cut. I think about the two big boards in Europe and I don’t think it necessarily reflected on Macquarie but maybe a bit, but they were all male.  If you just limited the diversity question to male/female to start with, that’s been a big shift. It’s probably even more so, for me, because I grew up in a family of six boys and one girl. My sister, who is extremely capable, and now running a big spiritually centre, she’s the National President and so on. So, she’s a very capable person. But she wasn’t much interested in commercial matters in her twenties. And she actually went and did teaching and had a family young, and then has probably come back later to those sorts of matters. And I think would have been every bit as competent as her brothers, but she wasn’t involved in those family boards, because her career choices and other choices – she had four young kids by the time she was 30, I would say."
36D Chair,36D Chair_35,A,"So, that’s going back through the 90s and the 2000s, the Macquarie stuff. We had quite a few senior female colleagues, but nowhere near what the legal profession or the accounting profession did, because of the nature of the work in my part of Macquarie, could be incredibly intensive. And there was an element to which we always said women were smarter and knocked it out of that, because it would just take over your life. But it was also not conducive to anybody wanting to start a family. It just really, I think, was very difficult to match with a period of pregnancy and/or post pregnancy period. And there were only a few women I saw try to do that. Talking to friends and observing it, I think there’s been a lot more effort made in that area to make it a more conducive environment."
36D Chair,36D Chair_36,Q,Now?
36D Chair,36D Chair_37,A,Yes.
36D Chair,36D Chair_38,Q,For how many years?
36D Chair,36D Chair_39,A,"That’s interesting. Because I’ve been out of Macquarie for 10 years. So, it's really only anecdotally and talking to friends, et cetera. But I feel like it’s more achievable over this post GFC period. Maybe it’s – and also, I was also overseas for the previous four, so it’s hard to tell between offices, et cetera. But I’d say Law and Accounting probably still provide a better opportunity to step in, step out. Maybe to do more from home or from choosing your own, whether you can be four days a week, et cetera. I think Mergers and Acquisitions, whether you're a lawyer or a banker, they tend to be, everybody’s expected to just put their life aside and get that done, sometimes."
36D Chair,36D Chair_4,A,"Practiced as a lawyer for about four years, during which time I did a Grad Dip in Applied Finance and was sort of taking a stronger interest in that area. And then I decided to do an MBA. I had an older brother studied in the US and I was envious of the career opportunities that had opened up for him and I was talking to him and decided to apply myself. So, I ended up making those applications, got lucky and got in to my school of first choice at Harvard. So, I did that MBA, early 90’s. I’m going back for my 25th reunion, funnily enough, in the next couple of months. So, time flies."
36D Chair,36D Chair_40,Q,Even now.
36D Chair,36D Chair_41,A,"I think so. I don’t believe it’s all of a sudden become a game where everybody says well, we’ve all got to have a life and let’s go home now and have dinner with the family and we’ll start this again in the morning. People just say the competition are – this bids going in and somebody else might make a counter bid or there’s a regulatory deadline. There’s always a deadline. And there's always that sense that it’s got to happen yesterday."
36D Chair,36D Chair_42,Q,An urgency.
36D Chair,36D Chair_43,A,"It’s rare that big corporate deals happen, just roll along at a gradual pace. They don’t. Whereas if you’re doing property law or litigation, they have their own rhythm. Property you lodge it and you wait for the title’s office. But my observation as a young lawyer was that, the female partners would often choose not to be, they weren’t in the [M&A] area, for example. Now that’s changed, I’m sure that there are probably more. But I still think that that’s one of the issues that they’re combining -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_44,Q,"So, it’s the work/life balance possibilities."
36D Chair,36D Chair_45,A,"Yes. And it’s sort of, you can try and work around that a bit. But my daughters just started at Freehills, so it’s really interesting for me to hear her observations of what partner she’s working with. She’s very keen to work under strong female partners that are setting– I connected her with one that I knew well, who’s been in the projects team which is sort of, probably not far off Mergers and Acquisitions, for huge deadlines and things. If you’re working on a big government pitch for a toll road or something, then that will have huge time pressure, potentially. And she’s a mother of two or three girls on the board at, I think [St Cath’s]00:16:42 in Toorak or [Mandeville]00:16:43 or something. I know she’s got teenage to later age daughters now and so on. And she’s been able to balance that, find a way through that. But I know from talking to her over lunch, that it’s not been easy. She’s had to fight to create some of that balance."
36D Chair,36D Chair_46,Q,And get a mentor.
36D Chair,36D Chair_47,A,"Well, that’s the partner. And she would have had probably only male mentors. I don’t reckon there were too many female partners ahead of her at [Freehills]. Because she’s a woman close to my age. She’d be similar, she’d be 50 something. So, I think she’s great for the ones then that are my daughter’s age, at 25, saying you’ve got to stand up for yourself a bit, and find and not put up with –interesting discussion, I might be diverting too much. My daughter just told me over dinner last week that they had – actually just a few nights ago with my partner – she was saying that they had, basically I suppose a diversity session, and there were some guys there, but it was 80/20, 90/10 sort of crowd. Much more about the women and they had that discussion. Well we’re preaching to the converted here. We’re all agreeing on it, but it’s really the guys that need to hear some of these messages."
36D Chair,36D Chair_48,A,"Because one of the big things was that the male partner in one of the teams there, and he went unnamed, had organised a golf day with the clients. And they’re not even invited, any of the women on the team, to go. And that was still happening now. Which I would have thought, I wouldn’t have been surprised if it was happening five or ten years ago, but I probably was surprised when she told me that the other day. And it really riled her of course, just because it was taking very junior guys in the team, but not quite senior females. So, it was really incredibly stereotyped. So that was – that’s just an anecdote to show that, even though I think the law firms are much more progressed and have been forever, ahead of, I think, say banks, investment banks, they’re still not there."
36D Chair,36D Chair_49,Q,That’s right.
36D Chair,36D Chair_5,A,"But when I came back, I was very tempted by an offer join Macquarie. I can’t remember, it was just a good friend, and I suppose, there were a couple of factors, my brother had gone to [McKinsey]00:01:21 and really enjoyed it and that’s where I went for a couple of years. But I ended up taking the offer at Macquarie two years later and moved a few hundred metres down Collins St, and spent most of my career in Finance as a result. 13 or so years at Macquarie, including the last four in London. And I guess to give the full picture there, that was intended to be in the private equity space, but they were getting an offer set up in Melbourne and they were taking over a smaller private equity operation and going to incorporate that into something else Macquarie was doing. But as is the way of these things, it wasn’t quite timed perfectly so, they said come and sit with the corporate finance guys in the M&A team and that all sort of evolved over the next six months, but it never did. The deal fell over. I liked M&A and the people I was working with and I just stayed there."
36D Chair,36D Chair_50,A,In terms of boards though. Which is really your -
36D Chair,36D Chair_51,Q,We’re focussing on boards.
36D Chair,36D Chair_52,A,"I have a listed board that I was with yesterday. We have an excellent female director. We would be very happy to have more. The company background, sorry focus, is technology and it’s in the medical and defence sort of areas. Defence has been a male dominated area, I think, and therefore the people with the networks and the experience that you’re likely to want to get on to the board for those reasons, are more likely to be male. That’s just sort of unfortunately, it’s not to say its exclusively that way, and we’ve got an opportunity for somebody that’s got those sorts of connections to make, because we lost a director or two just change of jobs, location, et cetera."
36D Chair,36D Chair_53,A,"But we’ve definitely, I see a huge value in having that diversity. I do think, it does change the dynamic and it’s just you get a different perspective and it’s hard to put your finger on exactly, but it’s just, I think there is a slightly different approach. And some women think more like men and some men think more like women. I know it’s a spectrum. But I just think if you’re generalising, you will get a definitely slightly different approach and a slightly different approach to the discussion in the meeting too. And I think it can be quite helpful to tone down some of the bulls in the paddock sort of behaviour. It doesn’t always work."
36D Chair,36D Chair_54,A,We had a guy on the board who was very problematic for me as chairman and we got rid of him. Just because his behaviours were just unhelpful.
36D Chair,36D Chair_55,Q,Can you describe those unhelpful behaviours?
36D Chair,36D Chair_56,A,"Yes. I think I could. It happened in this room sometimes when I opposed. He would – he was a very enthusiastic fellow, with some real strengths. I’m not pretending. But the weaknesses were around talking over people. Just wouldn’t let people finish a question. He’d anticipate the questions and start answering what he thought it should be or would be. Which was very frustrating. And would bluster sort of his way through when he was in a slightly awkward spot as to whatever he just tried to, loud, more correct sort of approach. I’m just going to – and sometimes just like a “Trust me, trust me, I know what I’m talking about here. This is my neck of the words. ” Blah, blah, blah. And it was no, no, we all need to get comfortable with this. We’ve got to talk it through. And it’s not enough for you to just say, I know."
36D Chair,36D Chair_57,A,"So it was that sort of style. And frankly, didn’t have a – he lost the confidence of the rest of the board. But that was probably a separate issue. But the behaviours that were bad for the dynamics were sort of coming all prepared and then sort of tried to bluster over things. And just short circuit conversations where we did need to get deeper and we did need to get everybody to understand, so that they could all contribute or at least get comfortable with the decision making that was under way."
36D Chair,36D Chair_58,Q,"Okay. Because an idea of inclusiveness, cultivating an inclusive culture, on the board, it sounds like he was at odds with that?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_59,A,"He was. So, it would be quite difficult for everybody. And we had one older director who, he’s quite good, but if he gets frustrated, he will say, “Excuse me I need to understand that better. ” But for the first year or so, he wasn’t used to being on a public company board. He had lots of value to add, but he wasn’t really an experienced director, at least for these sorts of matters. And I knew we weren’t getting the benefit of his insights, because he would just throw his back a bit. So, it was just a difficult dynamic."
36D Chair,36D Chair_6,A,"And about, I guess, five, six years in, we had a restructure and with that [Nicholas Moore]00:02:31 who became the CEO of Macquarie, eventually took over our group, and was big on the idea of Macquarie playing a principle role alongside our clients, or even instead of, maybe being the client. And that was quite a shift and created some ripples in commercial Australia."
36D Chair,36D Chair_60,Q,"So, what did you do to help him move forward, this old guy?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_61,A,"Well, I would just sometimes bring him directly into the conversation. I’d say “Alexander, I’m sure that you’ve seen this sort of thing in different guises and what would your take be?” And try to draw that out of him. I’d also talk to him offline and say, I want you to not feel the least bit of hesitation in interrupting and saying, I'm not comfortable that I've fully understood this fully. Because you might be speaking for all of us when you say that. I said I’m going to have to do it more often, because Richard is a difficult personality and we’ve got to work our way through that."
36D Chair,36D Chair_62,A,"In the end, it became obvious that we just – the CEO took him aside and spoke to him, I spoke to him as chair. I’d inherited, he actually approached me to join the board, so it was a funny –then they asked me to chair the board. So, I just had to say to him – it wasn’t that we were long term friends – but we were more just business colleagues. But yes, difficult, because likeable, but it often makes it even harder when they’re likeable rogues, but they’re rogues none the less. That was probably the – and we tried to concentrate as a chair to make sure you pick up the body language and see if people are feeling exasperated or just confused or thwarted in their attempts. And try to bring them in to the conversation and try to say, “Richard, is that the question you were asking Alexander? Because I don’t think it is, Richard. Can we just address the question?”So, try to do that. But in the end, we had to just move him on."
36D Chair,36D Chair_63,Q,"So, do you think any of this, from this gentleman, was because of an inability to cope with diversity on the board?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_64,A,"I’m not sure. I think it helped when [Yasmin]00:25:32 joined because she brought a different perspective, but she also was a very strong personality and very capable of just saying, “No, hold on, this isn’t my home ground, I need to understand that better. ” And she had some very relevant background, but not in the same space as this guy. And I think his view was he could just sort of –it was the whole snake oil salesman, you know, trust me. Look, I think his behaviours weren’t necessarily driven by a problem with diversity, they were helped, I think, by in a sense having some different ears on the table. But in the end that wasn’t enough to solve for it. I think skipping past him, she’s just been a very strong sort of extra presence on the board, who’s brought a different perspective and that’s diversity and background as well as an experience, et cetera. Her expertise and her experience is different to mine and to the other directors. So, it's not just about her being a female by any means."
36D Chair,36D Chair_65,Q,"So, can you expand on what board diversity means to you?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_66,A,"Well, those things. I think it is experience and it is expertise. But it is also you’re broader background. I think someone who has grown up sort of where a little stereotype, the silver spoon mouth, you’ve been through private school, mum and dad got you a tutor and the school made sure that nobody was going to fail. And you got through to your university course and you still had tutors or whatever. And you’ve done your fair bit of work, but you haven’t really ever known what it is to get up at five in the morning and do that couple of hours of work before or whatever it is."
36D Chair,36D Chair_67,Q,A barista.
36D Chair,36D Chair_68,A,"Yes, being the barista or something and squeezing stuff in as much. My kids meet half of that description. They haven’t had tutors and stuff, they’ve worked hard, but they’ve never known that real pressure. So, I think, having people with different degrees of that. I think people that have grown up in a – if it's not a battling environment, maybe a very different environment, rural environment or a foreign environment and so different sort of backgrounds that bring different perspectives. And I think women coming through, see things differently, because they see these subtle sorts of barriers and some not so subtle. So, I think that’s part of it. But I think people who have emigrated or people who have had big challenges, could be health challenges, could be disability or something. I’m working with a lawyer who’s a fantastic guy, who’s severely health challenged all his life. Amazingly capable and productive person. And I think the fact that he’s overcome that, probably really gives him a certain edge over many other people. So, I think it can come in lots of ways."
36D Chair,36D Chair_69,Q,"Cognitive diversity, different ways of problem solving, thinking about things."
36D Chair,36D Chair_7,Q,When was that?
36D Chair,36D Chair_70,A,"And I guess I’m just thinking that that’s a result of lots of that. But it is also true that you just meet some people who are, might have gone to the same school and university as you, but by virtue of their genetics or whatever else, think differently to you and I think that’s always a real positive."
36D Chair,36D Chair_71,Q,"Yes. Good. How important, let’s say ten is extremely important and one is not at all. How important is it for diversity in Australia?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_72,A,"I think, Australia or anywhere, it’s really important because group think is usually dangerous and -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_73,Q,"So, it’s about avoiding group think."
36D Chair,36D Chair_74,A,"If everybody sort of just gets on board and says yes, that sounds right to me. If you don’t get that person who’s sort of going oh well just because it’s always been done that way. There are alternatives and so on. Yes, it worried me at Macquarie. My team on the private equity space, we had a whole lot of ex-pat Aussies living in London, we did have some local poms, but generally male and generally in the 20 to 35bracket. My team sort of had a real sameness about it. One young guy was a Pakistani, but he had grown up in Toronto so, he wasn’t that different to us really. And all had done similar finance undergrads and so on. And they all worked in corporate finance and then slipped over to the private equity team. And I just said the next person has got to be, maybe from a management consulting background, instead. Where they’ve been going into companies and working on different types of issues, not corporate finance issues. Ideally a woman, ideally a European with multiple languages, because we’re working in Europe."
36D Chair,36D Chair_75,Q,Of course.
36D Chair,36D Chair_76,A,And I found that really interesting. Going across sitting on this board. We had eight European national operations that had been cobbled together under one head office in Amsterdam. And every one of those companies operated so differently because of the national characteristics.
36D Chair,36D Chair_77,Q,"Do you think being in Australia, that we need to have that kind of diversity to work, to link with Europe?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_78,A,"I think it helps a lot. I think if you just had a bunch of young, not even the age, but your classic never left Australia sort of 50-year-old blokes, sitting here, maybe gone on the odd European holiday, trying to work with companies that span, whether it’s Asia or Europe. And if you haven’t lived there, got some sort of cultural understanding of it, I think it’s harder by a long way. And your odds of success are probably a lot longer."
36D Chair,36D Chair_79,Q,"Is that pretty well – do you think it’s more important in a finance sector, than perhaps other sectors?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_8,A,That was about 2001.
36D Chair,36D Chair_80,A,"Not really. No. I would have thought that’s true, whether you’re manufacturing goods and you’re trying to work out how people buy things. And if you don’t understand the decision makers in – let’s take some European markets and say that in Germany – I’ll make stuff up. That it’s actually the women in the household that are making all these decisions, they’re doing all this purchasing, even though they might, in Australia, be deemed to be the Bunnings type male purchase. But in Germany they’re not. If you didn’t understand that and grasp that you could be -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_81,Q,Your advertising campaign is over.
36D Chair,36D Chair_82,A,"That’s right. You could be right out of touch. If you didn’t understand that – let’s look at a failed thing. They did try to take Bunnings into the UK using them and didn’t understand that the UK doesn’t have – there’s not those spaces for big box retail, in the sort of places that most people do their shopping. So, you’re trying to wrench them into a whole new type of purchasing behaviour. That on a Saturday instead of going down the High Street they’re driving out to the edges of London, which is no mean feat. Takes you your full hour or so to get to the edge of the city and two hours to get to the other edge of the city. So, that failed in London. Not just London, but the UK, as an overall move. So, I think you do need to understand culturally. And that’s, it doesn’t mean you have to immediately go and find a pom and put them on the board. But you’ve got to recognise your weaknesses. And you’re more likely to do that, the more opinions and mindsets around the table, the more likely you are to recognise those gaps."
36D Chair,36D Chair_83,Q,That’s good. And then you can fill it in through research or whatever. Your advisory board.
36D Chair,36D Chair_84,A,You bring advisers on and you maybe bring on a new director from that location.
36D Chair,36D Chair_85,Q,"So, would you say it’s a nine or a ten or an eight or -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_86,A,In terms of importance?
36D Chair,36D Chair_87,Q,Yes. Can you tie into it?
36D Chair,36D Chair_88,A,"Yes. It will vary by where you’re selling and what you’re selling, et cetera. And whether it services and so on. But I think if I was just trying to throw a blanket over it, I would have thought it was up there at the eight or nine."
36D Chair,36D Chair_89,Q,"And it does depend on the situational context. So, the reason it changes is – is there because of risk? Do you think it’s important in situations of risk? Or not important."
36D Chair,36D Chair_9,Q,Okay.
36D Chair,36D Chair_90,A,Yes. I think it’s – are we talking diversity generally?
36D Chair,36D Chair_91,Q,"Diversity, generally."
36D Chair,36D Chair_92,A,Generally.
36D Chair,36D Chair_93,Q,"And it’s very broad what you said. But ultimately to avoid group think, I think is your -"
36D Chair,36D Chair_94,A,"I think it – but I wouldn’t want to limit it to saying it’s a risk mitigant, because it’s much more than that. It’s about your creative. You can look at it, and say you’re eliminating some risk of the downside, but you’re also creating a huge upside potential."
36D Chair,36D Chair_95,Q,"That’s great. No-one’s put it so succinctly. That’s great. Is there a particular kind of diversity that matter more than others, do you think?"
36D Chair,36D Chair_96,A,"I think the type of – I do think it’s really important to have people who come at problems differently. And that can be driven, as we said, it could be your experience, it could be your expertise and it could just be your background, where you’ve lived and family experience and so on. But to me, it's about having people come at things differently. So, they’ll look at the same painting on the wall, and they’ll think about that quite differently."
36D Chair,36D Chair_97,Q,Yes. I notice that.
36D Chair,36D Chair_98,A,"So, that to me, is more important to me than saying, oh well, she’s a woman, she’ll understand how women purchase. That might be true, but there’s probably a bunch of really intuitive male marketers out there who’d understand that just as well or better. You don’t have to be a woman to understand, you don’t have to have played league football to coach it."
36D Chair,36D Chair_99,Q,"So, it seems that, and this is a theme that I think has come up. You’re about number 38 that I’ve interviewed. That other kinds of diversity like background, gender, all those demographics, they are contributing to this cognitive diversity or different ways. And it’s that what you want. It’s not how you get, whether it’s your background, whatever. But that you get cognitive diversity. Because through that you get risk mitigation and value creation. Is that it?"
37D,37D_1,Q,"Thank you very much, 37D, for agreeing to participate in our research, it’s fabulous, we’re really pleased to have you onboard.  We’re talking about board diversity, and we’re really interested to hear from people like yourself, who are on the ground, who sit on Australian boards, and then we’ll look at building theory from that experience.  So, thank you very much for contributing your experience."
37D,37D_10,Q,"So, we can reflect across four boards, three of which are not for profit and one is for profit.  That will be great.  What year were you first a director?"
37D,37D_100,A,Good.
37D,37D_101,Q,"I’d like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards.  Have you ever seen it create conflict, and if so, how was it managed?"
37D,37D_102,A,"I haven’t seen it create conflict, and I think this is where the basic rules need to be put down, as far as the respect, integrity, communication, and how that all plays out.  So, no I haven’t ever experienced that, to be honest."
37D,37D_103,Q,"That doesn’t arise from diversity, that arises from a poorly developed culture, does it?"
37D,37D_104,A,"I would suggest so, yeah."
37D,37D_105,Q,There’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and board functioning; do you feel that cognitive diversity influences your board’s functioning?
37D,37D_106,A,When you talk about ‘cognitive diversity’ can you just elaborate more on what you mean with that?
37D,37D_107,Q,"Well, I don’t mean anything.  There’s a term out there called cognitive diversity, it’s not fleshed out consistently in the theory so I can’t give you an objective view, but what I understand it to mean is that people have different approaches to problem solving.  Some people, for example, might be process oriented, some people might be outcomes oriented.  When you talked about the test you did to see how different people on the board think, that would be part of cognitive diversity?"
37D,37D_108,A,"Yes.  That’s fine.  I would suggest that cognitive diversity, if you don’t have it, I think, you would run the risk of having that groupthink.  So, you do need your people who are risk averse, like the checks and balances people, but you also need the future thinking people.  I guess this is why boards often will ask for a mix of people at the board, but they often will go for the education and skill base of a lawyer, a marketing person, an IT person.  Now, whether that’s the ideal type of way to advertise for people, I’m not sure.  You do, perhaps, need technical expertise, although on a board, you and conceivably ask for technical expertise to be brought in as you need it."
37D,37D_109,A,"So, I’m not totally convinced that you do need all that technical knowledge at the board, but I do think you need that way of looking at things.  For instance, generally, not always speaking, but older generations we may be more risk averse with our thinking because we’re in a different place in our life, and not always the case.  Whereas, a young person my see many different opportunities and ways a problem could be solved.  So, it’s important, absolutely, otherwise, I think, we could run the risk of that groupthink."
37D,37D_11,A,"With the  Credit Union, that was 1999 that I was appointed to that board, and in 2009 I voluntarily exited, and we may well get into why I did that, I’m not sure what the questions will be."
37D,37D_110,Q,Do people outside the board influence the selection process?
37D,37D_111,A,Outside?
37D,37D_112,Q,"Like recruitment organisations, do they influence the process of selection?"
37D,37D_113,A,"Well, I think it depends on what board you’re looking at.  Some boards do go through recruiters and will be that first point of call.  Some boards do their own recruiting, government boards it can be a variety of external recruiters or advisors from politicians seeking out various people to sit on government boards, although there is a more rigorous way of selecting people for government boards now, having to register, for instance, up front.  I think there are a variety of ways, and it might just be a word of mouth search, as well."
37D,37D_114,Q,"Do you think, the boards that you’ve been on, when they’ve been selecting new members, have they considered ways to increase diversity?"
37D,37D_115,A,"If I look at Australian Central Credit Union, when I was on that board we were purely member elected, and then, over time, we brought in a board selection subcommittee to interview candidates and we would have someone independent on that particular board, but mostly it was made up of board members, which is an interesting combination, in itself."
37D,37D_116,A,"Over time, with now what’s turned into People’s Choice Credit Union, I notice they’re really orchestrating the directors they have on their own board.  So, they’re trying really hard to vet out members who put their hands up before the election comes, so there’s no competition for the people they’re wanting on their board."
37D,37D_117,A,"Can you prove it?  Probably not, but that’s what it looks like."
37D,37D_118,Q,"Wow, and that’s more recent, these are recent practises?"
37D,37D_119,A,Yes.
37D,37D_12,Q,"The first question is, what does board diversity mean to you?"
37D,37D_120,Q,"So, very inward looking?"
37D,37D_121,A,Yes.
37D,37D_122,Q,"So, regulation hasn’t been able to change that?"
37D,37D_123,A,"Its interesting, isn’t it?  Because I would have thought regulation would contain it, but, I suppose, with any regulation, you can look at the rules and work around it to get what you need.  So, in the case, I suspect, with People’s Choice, for instance, they’re looking at particular skills and backgrounds of board members, so they would probably be arguing the case that, “These are the people we need on the board.”  So, I imagine that’s how they’re doing it."
37D,37D_124,Q,"Then, they’re presenting this group to their members who vote them on, is that it?"
37D,37D_125,A,"That’s right, that’s exactly right.  And, unless there’s quite a loud dissent it will just carry on as it is."
37D,37D_126,Q,"Do you feel tensions can arise in the board selection process, between on the one hand trying to avoid groupthink, and on the other to obtain a collegiate fit to support that culture of the board?"
37D,37D_127,A,What was the last part you said?
37D,37D_128,Q,A collegiate fit to support the culture of the board?
37D,37D_129,A,"It’s an interesting balance, really, because you certainly don’t want a board that’s just forever having a big talk fest about everything and not making decisions.  That’s why I think education of board members, when they are first reporting to boards, is really important, so they understand their role, they understand the process, they understand decisions need to be made, they understand the organisation they’re with.  So, those types of introductory processes and ground rules are really important.  I think there’s a fine line between collegiate and diversity.  It’s an interesting point you raise, really."
37D,37D_13,A,"Board diversity is, to me, much broader than just the male/female bit.  It’s something that needs to address the changing landscape, of our population, in cultural mix as well as age range.  I think countries, generally, are aging, so we need to have the younger to older generations, the different cultural backgrounds, and also the male/female things, and the skill mix, as well.  So, it’s multidimensional, it’s not just what, I believe, was initially the discussion of the board diversity, and that was simply male/female mix."
37D,37D_130,A,"I would, probably, feel happier with diversity as opposed to the collegiate gathering, depending on how deeply all the relationships ran and what the connections were.  There is talk in Eastern states, particularly in New South Wales, that there are particular old boys’ networks that just continually support each other to be on boards.  I don’t know if it’s true, but this is what I’ve heard.  That would worry me more, I think, as well."
37D,37D_131,Q,"I’ve interviewed board members, and they’re male, who have said, “I wouldn’t accept a board position if there was not gender diversity,” they can see that, because it’s a sign that board is too conservative for them."
37D,37D_132,A,"Yes, that’s really encouraging, that’s very good."
37D,37D_133,Q,"Yeah, that’s what the women say.  So, the boards that you’re on and are familiar with, do they have any barriers to managing or building diversity?"
37D,37D_134,A,"The two I’m currently on, no there are no barriers.  I guess it’s just really how they’ve landed, to be honest, and it’s to do more with the interest of the people involved in these particular bodies.  With the previous ones, the only barrier with Australian Central was to have the members support you; that was the biggest barrier.  Over time, what could have become a barrier, and did become a barrier to some, members who wanted to become board directors and who were not on the board currently, was the actual board interview process, and they didn’t, necessarily, pass the appropriate test of understanding corporate governance and fiduciary duty and things like that."
37D,37D_135,A,"That’s an interesting thing, in itself, given that some members owned financial institution to knock people out.  So, that’s a dilemma, in itself, in many ways, knocking members out of running for a member institution, ist’ probably more of a moral, ethical dilemma, I think, more than anything; perhaps not a legal dilemma, but morally and ethically, I think, very challenging."
37D,37D_136,Q,"To understand that, are you saying that if a person is a member of an organisation that they can’t become a member of the board unless they understand board governance, [overtalk] [00:33:13]."
37D,37D_137,A,"Yeah.  There were a number of questions about understanding the organisation, the fiduciary duties, the governance, just all those structures, which, in my view, can be learnt.  It’s not, necessarily, something you need to go to a board with.  It’s an old age question, isn’t it?  When you go for an interview and they’re wanting experience, if you don’t have experience how do you get experience if you don’t ever have the chance.  So, I think, entry into boards and onto boards is something, I think, is addressed by a number of organisations but we, probably, still have a bit more work to be done on that."
37D,37D_138,Q,"That’s interesting, isn’t it?"
37D,37D_139,A,Mm.
37D,37D_14,Q,"Do you think approaches to problem solving, or cognitive diversity, is also important in the way people approach decision making?"
37D,37D_140,Q,"Where I also thought there was a parallel, you’ve got the union where you need the members to support you.  With a government appointment, do you need the minister or someone to support you?"
37D,37D_141,A,"Yeah, the ministers sign off on those appointments.  Government boards are interesting because while there needs to be the robust discussions there can be constraints to how far you can go with, say, strategic plans.  So, with SA Water, for instance, the aim of SA Water, besides delivering water bulk and domestic water to South Australia, was to raise enough profit to then go back into government, to support the government processes.  So, there was a mandate there, even though it was a corporation, and not, necessarily, run by government, there was still that understanding that’s what needed to happen."
37D,37D_142,Q,"Right.  So, that’s communicated to the Chair or to all board members?"
37D,37D_143,A,"More or less to the Chair, and also the Chair of the Audit Committee, they understand that very well, and they’ll have meetings with the minister periodically, an update session.  When you become a board member on a government body, in my view, you do understand that there is room to suggest change, but there are certain constraints that you may need to work within."
37D,37D_144,Q,"Sure.  As board members, you are all aware of that?  Tt’s transparent to the board members, is it?"
37D,37D_145,A,"Well, I don’t know if it was ever said to me, if that’s what you -"
37D,37D_146,Q,Oh.
37D,37D_147,A,"I don’t know that it was ever said, I think it was just something I instantly understood, and I don’t know about the others, I think we all just understood it."
37D,37D_148,Q,"Okay, well -"
37D,37D_149,A,I’ve never thought about it before.
37D,37D_15,A,"Definitely, and in fact, one of the boards I was involved in what Australian Central Credit Union, and we undertook the HBMI, which looked at how we operated as directors.  What that identified was a number of board directors operated very much in information sorting, some operate in the communication, where some operated with emotional leads in their conversations and how they behaved, and some of us operated in a very futuristic thinking way."
37D,37D_150,Q,Otherwise it’s like the transparency problem.
37D,37D_151,A,Yes.
37D,37D_152,Q,"But it wasn’t experienced as a problem.  So, you were all selected well by the minister?"
37D,37D_153,A,"It’s interesting.  I think there’s that presumption that you won’t embarrass the government, and, I guess, the reason you won’t, as well, is because to go on a government board, in my view, you have some sort of loyalty to government, as well.  So, yeah, that’s interesting, I’ve never thought about it."
37D,37D_154,Q,"It’s a class thing, the culture of the board is powerful."
37D,37D_155,A,"Isn’t it, yes."
37D,37D_156,Q,"So, from a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted?"
37D,37D_157,A,"I think we still have a long way to go, from all accounts, and the reports on diversity, those boards that have diversity, and it still is the gender diversity we’re talking about and they appear to function better and they have more robust systems in place.  Look, I think there are still some ASX companies, I don’t remember how many, that do not have any female members on their board.  Whether they have other sorts of diversity I wouldn’t be sure.  So, there still is that resistance to the gender diversity on boards."
37D,37D_158,A,"I think we might see another, maybe, 20 years before we have true genuine diversity, where it’s not tokenistic.  Some are still tokenistic where they feel they have to appoint someone just for the sake of it, so I think we’ve still got a long way to go.  A bit like the wage gap, we’ve still got a long way to go there."
37D,37D_159,Q,"What’s holding it back, do you think?"
37D,37D_16,A,"Now, it was really good to do that exercise, but I never believed it was brought together so we all worked out how we worked with each other from there, it was still – because it was a financial institution, in my view, it was still seen that the accountant type of personality were the dominant personalities and they would lead the board direction, and they were quite risk averse, as well.  So, as far as future thinking went, it could happen, but it was, often, very watered down, in my view."
37D,37D_160,A,"I think Australian society is still, generally, very patriarchal, and I think we see this demonstrated on many fronts.  In my view we saw it when Julia Gillard was PM.  While she was greeted with open arms by some, there was absolute anger towards her for what had happened.  Now, we’ve seen it with male PMs overthrowing other male leaders and it doesn’t seem to even ripple, really.  So, I do think we still have this gender divide and we are, generally, a patriarchal society."
37D,37D_161,Q,"Wow.  So, in that context then, do we still need gender targets and quotas?"
37D,37D_162,A,"I think we need legislation.  I think we need to be like Iceland, for instance, where there’s legislation that says, “If men and women are employed in the same organisation in the same position, they do get paid the same, otherwise there are fines that will be applied to the company.  I think we need to see that through, not just our general employment, but particularly government boards, which I think we are doing better at.  The ASX boards and other boards, I think we need to look at the legislation to apply to them as well, which I think is better than quotas.  I think quotas can sound a bit tokenistic, but if it’s in legislation it can’t be avoided."
37D,37D_163,Q,"Brilliant.  Good on you.  So, looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
37D,37D_164,A,"Well, I would like to see no more discussion about gender diversity, because I find it quite an insulting discussion and one that I don’t feel comfortable having.  I think we pride ourselves on being a civil society, yet we still have these very basic discussions on equality, for instance.  So, I would like to see a more robust framework applied to boards, that actually is transparent, that board directors are held to account, that boards do have diversity across all the lengths and breadths that we’ve discussed."
37D,37D_165,A,"And, where shareholders and members do actually have a say if they’re not happy with how their board is performing.  And, not a tokenistic say, like we’ve seen recently with the AGM season where shareholders can be outraged, but where actual action can be taken to make board directors walk the talk, if you like, about how corporate governance should be applied."
37D,37D_166,Q,"Like the Commission of Enquiry into Banking, like that?"
37D,37D_167,A,"Oh, we need some prosecutions on that for that to ever have any teeth, I think, and whether we do see any prosecutions, I don’t know.  Often what happens is, it falls down the tree to those on the front line and the less empowered who can be prosecuted.  We’ve seen it, for instance, in the Aged Royal Commission, that it’s not the people in management or more senior, but it falls down to the aged care workers who are on the front line, who are the ones who are prosecuted, which I think is so unfair, because they’re only responding and acting in a position that they know best."
37D,37D_168,A,"So, with the Banking Royal Commission we need to see some action from that.  Now, whether we do or not, I don’t know, and it’s becoming further and further out.  I think if there aren’t any prosecutions, we’ll just see banking slowly slide back to how it was before."
37D,37D_169,Q,"What I sense was a democratic process, that boards are accountable to its members or shareholders, or whatever.  But, if Australian society is patriarchal, how will that form of accountability ensure the sort of equity that you’re concerned about, equality."
37D,37D_17,Q,Can I just clarify?  Is it HBMI test?
37D,37D_170,A,"I think governments can set the tone from the top.  So, if you have legislation that has to be enacted through laws and regulations and policies, which says, “This is how our boards need to look, this is how they must act, this is how they must behave,” that, I think, goes a long way to changing how society views itself.  It’s not then, just about one particular group being in charge, it’s about the equitability of diversity, because the framework says, “This must happen.”"
37D,37D_171,Q,"Okay, that’s wonderful.  This legislation that you’re talking about, for boards, and it’s pay as well, will assist a transformation in our patriarchal society here?"
37D,37D_172,A,"Yes, because we see that expectation then, actually from the highest law makers in our land, that that’s what’s expected.  When you look at wage equity, you’re look then also at equity in parenting leave, for instance, and it can then run onto childcare accessibility and affordability, as well.  So, there are a whole lot of knock on effects from looking at equitable wages."
37D,37D_173,Q,"Right.  That’s brilliant.  So, this is a seriously multi-level, we’re talking government, government institutions, and probably director programs, because you’re saying education is very important of board members."
37D,37D_174,A,Yes.
37D,37D_175,Q,That’s wonderful.
37D,37D_176,A,Very good.
37D,37D_177,Q,Do you have any last final comments?
37D,37D_178,A,"Well, I don’t mean to be a pessimist, but I don’t know that anything is going to change in the short term."
37D,37D_179,Q,Do you think it will change in the 10 years?
37D,37D_18,A,"Yeah, I’d have to get back to you with that, I’ll let you know, I’ll give you a call, that will be helpful for you."
37D,37D_180,A,"As far as the legislation for equitable wages, I don’t think we’ll have the appetite for that, in the foreseeable future, because within equity in wages is people business, so unions, for instance, have a platform, they have a reason to exist, for example.  So, I think we’ve got a lot of work to be done yet."
37D,37D_181,Q,"So, some of the barriers are not just social then, are they economic?"
37D,37D_182,A,"I think so, and I think there a stakeholder investment in self-interest, as well."
37D,37D_183,Q,"Okay.  We can just start this interview again and explore the stakeholder interest.  That was fantastic, that was really great."
37D,37D_184,A,"My pleasure, I enjoyed it a lot.  Thank you."
37D,37D_185,Q,"Thanks 37D.  I’m going to turn it off, so we –"
37D,37D_187,Q,END OF TRANSCRIPT
37D,37D_19,Q,"It’s interesting, yeah that would be great.  This culture of risk aversion and focusing on finances, was that, do you think, cultivated by the regulation of the financial industry, at the time?"
37D,37D_2,A,My pleasure.
37D,37D_20,A,"Sorry, say that again."
37D,37D_21,Q,"Do you think that the culture, of this financial board, the risk aversive culture and the focus on financial decision-making styles, was that, perhaps, influenced by the regulation of the board, at that time?"
37D,37D_22,A,"It possibly could have been.  Yeah, I think regulation was a factor, and risk aversion was also a factor as well, so I do think, in some degree, that was the influence.  Also, at that time, they were bringing in the requirement, it was for financial institutions to hold so much in capital against their loan book, as well, so there was quite a bit of, I guess, turmoil in the industry, at times."
37D,37D_23,Q,How did this fit in with the global financial crisis?
37D,37D_24,A,"Well, this was just before the global financial crisis.  What we were finding before the global financial crisis, loan books, particularly for smaller institutions, were becoming quite challenged, and for smaller institutions, in fact, in some ways they were shrinking.  So, therefore, there was that thought that the bigger big four were being supported by government to more of an extent than the smaller institutions."
37D,37D_25,Q,"So, how was the government intervening, here, in that industry?"
37D,37D_26,A,"From what I remember, the government was looking at – I’m sorry, I’ve been thrown off my game, I just read an email that took my attention, I wished I hadn’t looked at it, actually."
37D,37D_27,Q,Do you want to have a pause?
37D,37D_28,A,"Yeah, can I have a pause for a minute?"
37D,37D_29,Q,"Of course, I’ll turn this off, and do you want to email me when you’re ready?"
37D,37D_3,Q,There are a couple of demographic questions; how many years have you been a board director?
37D,37D_30,A,"Yes, or I can give you a ring back, one or the other, yeah, sure."
37D,37D_31,Q,Okay.
37D,37D_32,Q,Interruption- part 2
37D,37D_33,Q,"Okay, thanks 37D.  The question we were exploring was, whether, and if so, how government was intervening in the financial industry, and this was leading up to the financial crisis and you mentioned someone about the four major banks, they were being affected differently than the smaller -"
37D,37D_34,A,"Yeah.  I can’t remember the details now, but in effect, the big four banks were given more guarantee, from what I remember, like deposits and what have you than the smaller credit unions and banks, like say the Bendigo Bank, and there was a real us and them mentality.  That’s probably all I recall, at that point, which is probably not that helpful, I’m sorry."
37D,37D_35,Q,"No, but it might reinforce the culture of the board that you were on, being risk averse and financially focused."
37D,37D_36,A,"That’s right.  I think, also, the risk averseness, you can be risk averse in certain ways, with a financial institution, as in any other business, I believe, in fact, you’re handling people’s money responsibly and investments responsibly is certainly top of mind, but I think there could have been more risks taken with marketing and with engaging with customers in the future, for instance.  So, there were elements where we could have taken, I think, more risks."
37D,37D_37,Q,"So, lack of diversity was playing a role in how risk was managed, and your exposure to risk, in your view?"
37D,37D_38,A,"Yeah, I think so, and I think, also, there was quite a significant – if I remember rightly, I think we had nine directors plus the CEO, who was non-voting, but from what I recall, there was quite a significant group of risk averse accountant type thinking people, all these auditing type thinking people who wanted to be more careful with the strategy.  The other observation I made was the Chair and the CE, which I would expect had pre-meetings, but then I felt I would witness the Chair really moving the meeting how he wanted to, and, possibly, in relation to the conversation he had previously with the Chief Executive."
37D,37D_39,A,"So, my view is, these conversations do need to happen between Chairs and Chief Executives, but I do think there needs to be a certain disclosure element in that conversation, as well, if we’re going to have full transparency there needs to be that frank and feel of disclosure, as well, of those side conversations."
37D,37D_4,A,"I have been a board director, on the current two boards that I’m involved in – with one it would be about six months because we’re formulating that one, and that’s an Australian Association for a group of health practitioners, so I’m an inaugural board member.  There is an advisory board, of an Australian Research Fund, and that is set up to support students looking into PTSD."
37D,37D_40,Q,Do you think that’s a strategy that reduces diversity of decision making?
37D,37D_41,A,"Yeah, I think so, because what I witnessed, and I did speak to a few of my other board colleagues, was that conversations would be directed in a certain way, and conversations that were not welcome would be shut down.  Often, the line would be used, ‘in the interest of time’, which, I think, if you’re going to have a board you need to let people explore ideas and voice their views, whether they’re mainstream or not, they need to be heard."
37D,37D_42,Q,"So, the culture of the board wasn’t inclusive of diversity?"
37D,37D_43,A,"I think diversity of thought, absolutely, and I think there were some situations where – well, I did, I witnessed people being, “Thank you very much for your contribution,” and not allowed to finish what they were saying."
37D,37D_44,Q,Right.  How many women were on the board?
37D,37D_45,A,"It varied over the 10 years.  The most females we had, at any one time, I think I recall three of us, yeah, three of us.  Now, none of us ever held significant positions, we were all directors, but we didn’t hold Chair or Deputy Chair, we didn’t hold Chair of any of the subcommittees either, from what I recall.  Yeah, it was quite male dominated."
37D,37D_46,Q,"More recently, there’s an inclusion of sexual differences and other things, ethnicity and different sexuality.  Do you think these kinds of diversity are important?"
37D,37D_47,A,"I think so.  I don’t know whether you need to list every single diversity, but I think we need to be mindful that this could be an inclusion in a particular board, and boards are meant to be representative of their stakeholders or their community.  So, I don’t see any reason why not, and dependent on the board.  I mean, for a financial institution, I suppose, before same sex couples had equal rights to same sex couples, that would have been quite a valuable person to have on a board to really voice that view."
37D,37D_48,Q,"Because home loans and things, yeah."
37D,37D_49,A,"Yeah, that’s right."
37D,37D_5,A,"Apart from that, I was on a couple of boards. An Australian Central Credit Union, and I was on that one for 10 years and there was also a state utility, that was for six years that I was on that particular board."
37D,37D_50,Q,"Very interesting, good point.  So, how have the composition of boards, that you’re familiar with, changed over time in terms of diversity?  You’ve had quite a spread of time since ’99."
37D,37D_51,A,"The two I’m involved in now; one is totally all women, and the reason being, the person who set that board up that was her focus, was to do research into first responders in the medical field, and particularly focused on women, it was the Medical Women’s Memorial Research Fund.  The other one I’m involved in now, is more female dominated and probably due to the fact that in the nutrition profession there seems to be more female nutritionists than male.  So, I think it’s purely from that point of view."
37D,37D_52,A,"For instance, with the board of the Nutritionists Australasian Association and Register of Practising Nutritionists, over time, I would suggest to them we would need to diversify.  I’m the only non-nutritionist on the board, at the moment, so I think, over time, once it’s settled, we do need to look at different skillsets, for instance."
37D,37D_53,Q,"So, it’s in its formative stage, at the moment."
37D,37D_54,A,That’s right.
37D,37D_55,Q,"If I gave you a scale of 10 as extremely important and one as not at all, how important do you think having a diverse board is?"
37D,37D_56,A,"So, 10 is important?"
37D,37D_57,Q,"Yeah, 10 is extremely important and one is not at all."
37D,37D_58,A,"When we talk about diversity it’s all encompassing, it’s not just male/female, its everything that you and I talked about just now."
37D,37D_59,Q,"As you defined it, as you discussed it, yeah."
37D,37D_6,Q,Was the credit union one a for profit?
37D,37D_60,A,"That’s right.  I would say it’s closer to 10 because of the want to have that strong governance, and transparency, there in that particular decision-making body."
37D,37D_61,Q,"How does it contribute to transparency, diversity?"
37D,37D_62,A,"In my view, the big way this would contribute to transparency is the fact that you wouldn’t run the risk of having directors from similar thinking backgrounds, or similar thinking friendship groups, or similar thinking professional groups.  You could bring them all in to be individual thinkers rather than having formed those connections.  That can happen, for instance, on government boards it can happen, and on financial institution boards it can happen.  You can have like, “Bring your mates in,” that type of arrangement on boards."
37D,37D_63,Q,Have you seen this happen?
37D,37D_64,A,"Well, I would say, for instance, in the financial institution one that I was involved in, there were directors who were appointed to the board who were not members of the credit union, which was one of the prerequisites, because it’s a member owned institution.  They were appointed to the board for their skillset to, supposedly, bring a different level of skill to the board.  I think it might have been done clumsily, though, because it did look a bit like bringing in people who knew each other.  How do I know?  I’m not quite sure, really."
37D,37D_65,Q,"It’s just the appearance, yeah."
37D,37D_66,A,"Yeah, it’s just how it looks."
37D,37D_67,Q,"We’re going to have questions later about board selection, so we can look in more detail at that.  I’m still working on the transparency – like not having social networks that might collude and create group think, I can see that as good governance.  The transparency side is, I suppose, because of the networks, is it?  How is it transparent, how does it -"
37D,37D_68,A,"I would suggest that if you had solid friendships on the board, you may be less likely to see frank and feel of conversation, particularly if there are disagreements.  You may be less likely to have total declarations; there might be part declarations of interest but may not be total declarations of interest because of that friendship running so deep.  There may be that protectionism belief in place.  I’m not sure, I don’t know whether I’ve witnessed it, I think it would be hard to prove or out unless someone knew of some backgrounds of some close colleagues on boards, but I have heard it talked about."
37D,37D_69,Q,"So, what it definitely does, it reduces your confidence in transparency?"
37D,37D_7,A,"With the credit unions it really is a for profit, it would call itself more of a not for profit, a mutual organisation, but it operates under the banking sector regulation."
37D,37D_70,A,"Yeah.  I think, what could happen also, is there may be a bit of laziness that can creep in thinking that, “He’s my friend, she’s my friend, they probably read the board papers, I don’t need to worry so much.  They’ve got strength in this, I don’t have strengths in that,” so maybe not getting the most out of every director could be a result, as well."
37D,37D_71,Q,"Do you think there is any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating, like high uncertainty, high risk?"
37D,37D_72,A,I’m not sure what you mean?
37D,37D_73,Q,The importance rating of 10 for diversity.  Are there some situations where you might think it’s not so important?
37D,37D_74,A,"No, I think in any board it needs to be taken with importance because there is legislation that does govern boards and board performance.  No, I think it’s important all round.  I think, though, when it comes to not for profit, non-paid positions, it can be challenging to get the right mix of people because, purely, having people volunteer their time can be quite a tall ask.  But for a not for profit, a non-paid position is just as important as a paid position because they’re all governed under the same umbrella."
37D,37D_75,Q,"And, still exposed to as much liability risk?"
37D,37D_76,A,"That’s right, yes."
37D,37D_77,Q,"We can talk about that in a minute, as well.  Does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others?"
37D,37D_78,A,"Well, I guess, really, we do need to make sure, because we do live in a society where it’s half male half female, that there is an importance on having that inclusion represented in a board.  I also think it’s important to recognise younger and older people, and having that representation on boards, as well.  So, they’re two groups, I think, that need to be considered, and there are others that cascade behind that, as well.  It may be specific, dependent on your board that you’re looking at, as well, what other categories of diversity you look at."
37D,37D_79,Q,Do you mean the organisation’s strategic direction and all that?
37D,37D_8,Q,"I’ll put that down as a for profit.  Then, you’ve got a professional one and the research funds, are they both not for profit?"
37D,37D_80,A,"Yes, what its mission is, the strategic direction, why it’s there, why it exists.  That may be important to consider for other cross sections of diversity."
37D,37D_81,Q,"That’s a more enduring factor, that’s not, “Oh well, we’ve got a global financial crisis looming, so let’s do something to change our diversity ranking.”"
37D,37D_82,A,Yeah.
37D,37D_83,Q,So now board functioning; we want to understand how diversity influences board functioning.  Are there particular functions it really helps with or that it can limit?
37D,37D_84,A,"I think, if we’re talking about women and men, or we’re talking about young people and older people, I think we all have different perspectives on life, and we all tend to come at situations through different perspectives.  When I’m talking about this, I’m feeling like I’m getting tangled up in knots in many ways, because at the end of the day, you don’t want a groupthink on a board, that is a dangerous practise to have groupthink."
37D,37D_85,A,"So, to have diversity means that robust conversation should be encouraged on points that are listed on the board papers or points that are raised.  So, I would say, diversity, just from experience, education, background, knowledge, that is all brought to the board table.  However, that won’t be harnessed unless the board has set down it’s ground rules of mutual respect, listening, understanding, giving each person the opportunity to speak."
37D,37D_86,A,"So, there’s a whole communication and just general respect that comes into play, as well, and encouraging every board member to make sure they put forward their perspectives, and accepting that there is no silly contribution, no silly question, no wrong way to look at things. It’s all part of having a robust discussion."
37D,37D_87,Q,"This is sounding like there’s an emerging model from all the interviews I’ve done.  Let me put it to you and see what you think, because it’s like what you’re saying, I think.  Fundamentally, the benefit of diversity is that it avoids groupthink, it provides excellent problem solving by avoiding groupthink, and including strategic thinking, vision and stuff.  You can only get that if the culture of the board is, as you say, includes different voices and uses the sort of strategies you talked about, and it has a culture to support that, to reinforce that."
37D,37D_88,Q,"I’ve got a triangle idea; so at the base of the triangle is the demographic diversity, and that can depend on, as you say, the purpose of the organisation and things like that, but that’s where you need the gender diversity, geographic diversity if that’s relevant to the purpose of your board, aged diversity, all those things, those more tangible things, so they’re at the base.  Then, they come up through this decision-making process, which is supported or not by the culture of the board, and what comes out of that is decisions that avoid group-think and add value to the society and the company, the organisation."
37D,37D_89,Q,"So, if it’s clear, is that consistent with your view, or would you tinker with it some way, add something?"
37D,37D_9,A,"The first two I mentioned, yeah, they’re not for profit."
37D,37D_90,A,"Okay, so let me get this triangle.  At the bottom is the general demographic?"
37D,37D_91,Q,Yeah.
37D,37D_92,A,"Then, along the sides, just go through that again for me please."
37D,37D_93,Q,"You can think of it as an arrow, if you want, it doesn’t have to be a triangle.  So at the base is the gender, the demographic diversity, then we’ve got the decision making, and that’s supported by the culture of inclusion.  Without that culture the view is, “Well, it doesn’t matter if you’re got the people, if they’re given token recognition, etcetera, then that’s not going to contribute to decision making in an effective way."
37D,37D_94,A,Yeah.
37D,37D_95,Q,"Then, you’ve got decision making that, for example, avoids group-think, and then, the outcome for that decision making by the board, is that you’ve got value creation, and risk mitigation, I forgot that one; value creation and risk mitigation that adds value to the company and to the broader society."
37D,37D_96,A,"Yeah.  I think that sounds like a good sound model.  I think vision is really important when it comes to developing a culture and really engaging that vision in every layer of the organisation.  So, starting with the board and the management team, and filtering it all the way through.  So, the vision needs to come to life and that will, I think, unlock the values and the culture as well."
37D,37D_97,Q,"Why does there need to be this consistent thread, in terms of culture, between the organisation and the board?"
37D,37D_98,A,"Well, I think it’s important because you don’t want to have two separate organisations working within one, so the board, with it’s strategic direction, needs to know and live what it’s there for as far as the organisation goes, and also be aware of the value it delivers, not just to the organisation, but to its shareholders, if it has shareholders, or members.  Then, that needs to cascade through the organisation to make sure that the whole organisation is working as a whole.  So, the board is really orchestrating, if you like, how the organisation operates within the environment."
37D,37D_99,Q,"That’s brilliant, thank you, that helps a lot."
38IN,38IN_1,Q,"Good, thank you so much. 38IN, I just wanted to check a demographic before we go forward – the discipline background, your discipline background. What is that?"
38IN,38IN_10,A,Yes.
38IN,38IN_100,Q,"Exactly. Now, there is a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and Board functioning. You have alluded to this. Can you talk a little more about how you think it influences Board functioning?"
38IN,38IN_101,A,"This will have to be very separate from the Australian shareholders opinion because as I said, we don’t really, as retail shareholders or representatives of retail shareholders, get any access to how the Board dynamics are working in that sense. So back from my Board performance days, which followed on from my insti investor days; the importance of how the Board thinks and how they interact and their ability to be - mindful is the only word that comes to mind but be aware and self-aware in those Board meetings, that is really crucial to how the group will operate."
38IN,38IN_102,A,"And that’s where taking those little things where someone gets the feather to talk or the talking stick, you usually don’t have to do that for a professional Board but that’s where they have a gain because some people can’t do that on the fly. But it really makes a difference and I just love that year of my life or year and a half of my life where we got to go into read all the minutes and the like for the meetings as we did the Board assessment and question all the different Directors. I suppose I had thought from the outside they must be more professional in doing this than they appear from the decisions and the trajectories their companies are taking. But they’re not. It’s just as messy as your local club lunch."
38IN,38IN_103,Q,"That’s interesting. So this role you had, what was that?"
38IN,38IN_104,A,I was with Lyn Ralph who used to be an ASIC Commissioner and various other things and she was a Director and Alan Cameron who is also a lawyer and long-standing Director. For years he did the AICD Director update. They developed a firm with Phil Khoury and they needed someone to work on developing the model. And I got to do that.
38IN,38IN_105,Q,Fantastic.
38IN,38IN_106,A,"And I did that, I was on a three-month contract but then it just morphed because they couldn’t interview people that they had relationships with, professional relationships with, so Phil and I would get to interview some of the Directors. The more important the Director, the more likely they would have that relationship with Alan Cameron or Lyn. And so Phil and I got to do those interviews."
38IN,38IN_107,Q,"Very exciting, very interesting."
38IN,38IN_108,A,It was really interesting because I had some beliefs and I suppose I really had hoped they were better and more self-aware beings. And just having it confirmed that they weren’t made me feel more comfortable about my own assessments.
38IN,38IN_109,Q,That would be harsh.
38IN,38IN_11,Q,I think so.
38IN,38IN_110,A,"Because as an institutional investor it’s a big thing, we would interact much more with the executives and the investor relations because even you are projecting forward models 10 years and you really needed those details. They’re not really inside information but, because it’s all available out there that it makes it very much a mosaic. And then you make your own judgements and you just decide whether you feel, I think it’s a Chair, the CEO is a good reflection of the Board."
38IN,38IN_111,A,"If you have a really quality CEO who is on top of things, quite often their Board was similar. Good questioning, good support and that sort of thing. So you could just say the CEO is my exemplar for the Board. But as a retail shareholder you’re a step further away. They’re not projecting even six months. So it interacting with the actual Board who are responsible for making sure that everything is stewarded correctly, the stewardship is carried out. That’s where we engaged."
38IN,38IN_112,Q,Good. Really interesting. We want to focus on that process side of it though. Does your organisation do anything to cultivate Board candidates?
38IN,38IN_113,A,No.
38IN,38IN_114,Q,No? What might your organisations do to perhaps influence the Chair in selection of Chair apart from that conversation which you have already said? Anything else?
38IN,38IN_115,A,In terms of selection of Chair? Probably not.
38IN,38IN_116,Q,Yes. Or influencing the Chair’s decisions or the way they manage the Board?
38IN,38IN_117,A,Nothing other than what we’ve talked about already.
38IN,38IN_118,Q,That’s okay. So your organisation wouldn’t do anything to help candidates from minority groups or anything like that?
38IN,38IN_119,A,"No. Quite often we’ve seen self-appointed candidates from left-field, such as in Ramsay Healthcare last year, the one who purports to be the daughter of Ramsey put herself forward. And actually, closer to home, one of our former directors Stephen Mayne would quite often put himself forward for a board position. And we would vote against him. He didn’t do it while he was on our board, but prior to that. We feel that the occupation of a board seat needs to be done by someone who adds value to that company, and it’s a waste if it’s not."
38IN,38IN_12,A,From the original contact.
38IN,38IN_120,A,"In terms of those externally put forward candidates, usually we have no tools that would meet our judgement to say that person would really add to that Board. But in the Carly Ramsey example, she did not put forward anything that suggested she would be able to evaluate multibillion-dollar capital decisions for example. We would look to their history for that, and as mentioned before we do like people on the Board more than just the Chair to have prior experience in the industry."
38IN,38IN_121,Q,So if your organisation votes against a candidate is there a chance that they still get up?
38IN,38IN_122,A,Yes.
38IN,38IN_123,Q,What? A 20% chance?
38IN,38IN_124,A,"Quite often, it depends really on the company. Something like Commonwealth Bank, we might get what’s called a [inaudible] 0:42:08.5 [of faith], $500 million worth of investment, but that is still a small amount of capital in the scheme of things. Where we really get a gain is in the embarrassment, either the embarrassment or the straw that breaks the camel’s back. So if a number of people are also voting against and then we just tip it over."
38IN,38IN_125,A,"I think Gerry Harvey is particularly negative about the ASA and Singleton I think was calling us names at the last meeting as well. If you’re happy to be embarrassed you could withstand our suggestions or our engagement. A lot of people aren’t. So where there is a sizeable against vote we have seen people withdraw their candidacy. And that’s a tricky thing because I think for the first time Navitas last year, Tracy Horton got 50.1% vote, she’s the Chair and she got in by .1%, and I had not seen that before in a larger company."
38IN,38IN_126,Q,It’s usually much?
38IN,38IN_127,A,"People would walk, if there was a 15% vote against the Director, they would say how dare you, how embarrassing, I’m out of here. Obviously you don’t want me. Whereas it was tied up with a takeover so I think to my mind that actually shows that she did the right thing with the takeover because they would have needed 75% vote to go through with the takeover but it actually got 50% in her favour means that there wouldn’t have been 50% in favour of the vote, of the takeover vote. But that’s would have been tough in the face of dissatisfaction is really why they get paid the big bucks. But it isn’t common. Most people with just withdraw."
38IN,38IN_128,Q,"Okay, you might be selecting the worst kind, those who don’t feel shame, are the ones who survive."
38IN,38IN_129,A,"Well, I use this one as an example because yes, shame is an important part of how we can influence people but we actually, I wrote about Tracy Horton and how supportive it was. It is unusual but good on her for sticking to her guns and looking after shareholders."
38IN,38IN_13,Q,"Yes that’s right, it’s not on my thing to ask for it. Okay, firstly how have the composition of Boards that you’re familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity do you think?"
38IN,38IN_130,Q,Good on her. Excellent. So what do you see is the main barriers to building diverse Boards in Australia? And how do they work?
38IN,38IN_131,A,"I think we still have a general sexism. And a general lack of awareness. I am still hearing, many years after leaving uni that women wouldn’t want to do that job, or there’s not enough women and yet in my daily life I run into people who have been engineers and worked on remote mines and the like and it’s just they have not drawn the attention of the general populace. I think where Boards need to be more aware and more - combative is not the right word. I know for example that when I was at Macquarie, just in the general employment sense we would get a shortlist roll which would be all male and we would go back and go what? How is this so?"
38IN,38IN_132,A,"And HR at that particular time would come back and say well, we choose the best candidate. We’re not going to put any quotas over the top of that. But if you have an industry that’s sexist already or really gender weighted to blokes, then everybody who has got 20 years’ experience, there’s going to be more blokes than females and so maybe you have to say I want two women on that shortlist no matter what. You know, do your shortlist your way and then get me the next two women. Because if you haven’t got two women on that list by the way you’re constructing it I want you to go and find the next two that would be on there if we were taking a bigger pool. So I think there is still that old attitude that there is no sexism, that lack of awareness that people think people like the people around me are successful."
38IN,38IN_133,Q,"Do you think there is, apart from gender maybe cultural, age, sexuality, that these kinds of types of diversity are also important?"
38IN,38IN_134,A,"I think overarching diversity, so yeah basically everything. I’m not so aware of whether sexuality is being impacted on Boards because we have had openly gay is such a stupid term but basically I’m not trying to fix anyone up with their partner so that doesn’t actually come up. But I don’t know that I look at the Boards and think wow, they’re all hetero."
38IN,38IN_135,Q,Do you think that’s an unconscious bias with ASA then or is it that it’s not necessary?
38IN,38IN_136,A,"No I’m thinking not that they don’t need to be balanced, just that I mean this is the issue that our members would like people to put their age in so they don’t have the calculate it whereas I think you look at the pictures you can sort of -"
38IN,38IN_137,Q,Tell.
38IN,38IN_138,A,"To get near enough because 36 to 39 there’s not much of a difference. Really if you want age diversity and more youth you need 35-year-olds and 70-year-olds, not 70 and 68. No, what I mean is that when I think of variety of business people, when their sexuality has become apparent, they have positions and I don’t know that Boards, I think Boards have been more resistant against female participants than gay men. But I have nothing to, that’s just an absorption feeling. Now thinking it through maybe there is less representation but harking back to my earlier comments, about 50% female being an easy metric because it’s so large, half/half, that is why it’s very difficult to make those judgements about Board diversity. Should 3% be Mandarin speaking at 3% be Cantonese and 2% be indigenous and that sort of numbers when you’re talking of a group of eight people."
38IN,38IN_139,A,"When we are highly focused on Boards. 12% is typically your mark-up. Which is why we are actually quite happy with 30% minimum of either gender, because quite often, smaller boards are three people. You can say 40%, but as a base for all companies, we’ll be happy with 30%. Which doesn’t stop you having 60% being the other gender. But the other diversity is important, it’s just that I think an awareness of bias is probably the biggest - that’s one hurdle, and again, similar to the females, the idea that the existing pools where you draw your people from, if that pool is already not diverse, then you have to start being clever and introducing outsiders from somewhere. And where do you introduce those outsiders?"
38IN,38IN_14,A,"When I started in the equity market in the 80s the Boards were comprised purely of males of a certain age. Actually I tell a lie there, we had a lot more younger men on Boards, people would be appointed in their 30’s if they were particularly skilled or connected or both. So predominantly male, predominantly Anglo-Saxon."
38IN,38IN_140,Q,"That’s really interesting because some Directors have talked about, quite differently about the sort of experience that is necessary for their Board members. And some, the experience of the industry is very important, whereas others, I had one just recently preferably not. No experience of the industry, because you’ve got your CEO bringing all of that. What the Board is bringing is X, Y, Z. And that was amazing."
38IN,38IN_141,A,That was interesting. Can I just ask what size that Board was?
38IN,38IN_142,Q,How many people on it?
38IN,38IN_143,A,Yes.
38IN,38IN_144,Q,Eight.
38IN,38IN_145,A,"So one where we’ve actually been public on that one, that would be Rio. It was felt that because the Chair and the CEO, we don’t like having two executives on the Board and they have their CFO on the Board but we argued that that means that somebody is there with their boss and that kind of changes the dynamics of the room. But if your Chair has to be very close to your CEO. So there’s no one outside those three who can really say hey, every project I’ve ever been involved in does this. I personally feel that Directors can acquire that experience of being one step away from the action, but our members, particularly feel that companies go astray when you have that situation where the Chair, CFO and CEO are the repository for all that knowledge. And basically the rest of the group, it is felt the rest of the Directors have to go along for the ride on some of the details."
38IN,38IN_146,Q,"It’s interesting isn’t it? This person, I have to then put it in context. The way this person described their organisation; the Board was very open and interacted with the organisation, Directors would go through and they had various committees. So the organisation and the Board was seen as much more interconnected than perhaps I had heard from other Directors. So probably I have to put it in the context of this is how the Board functioned in the organisation."
38IN,38IN_147,A,"Yes, that does make a difference and just from doing lots of company you know, trying to pick where companies have been going for a long time, I do see a risk with that that you are a little beholden to the company with that openness and I just wonder if they could veer off into some sort of disaster which only in 10 years’ time you will know the answer to that."
38IN,38IN_148,Q,"So ASA as an organisation then; how open? When you go and talk to the Chair or whatever, have a conversation, so it might not be about tenure, it might be about the kinds of industry experience of the members on the Board or lack of it. And if the Chair was saying well, this is how we do stuff would you accept that and think oh yeah fine that’s how you do things? Or would you raise your concerns?"
38IN,38IN_149,A,"Typically the Boards don’t share that style of information. For example when we say hey, we’re concerned with this person’s workload they will quite often, they might say something like you know they don’t play golf, they don’t play tennis. They have six Boards and that’s their life. And they always contribute in a meaningful fashion. That’s the style of dialogue we have with them. And we have all also had the ‘just trust us’. They never say just trust us, but they will not give sufficient information usually for you to feel comfortable that you know how that particular Board works. AMP for example, when that was all going messy last year. They basically were answering things as they became public. So we commissioned this, that and the other and then like I said before, you don’t get any internal information in any of these dialogues. It is much more like the Board is representing - sorry, the Chair is representing the Board."
38IN,38IN_15,Q,And when you say - what were they connected to?
38IN,38IN_150,Q,And they will use you to reinforce their public image?
38IN,38IN_151,A,"Well I think that there is a certain amount of information that is intimate to the Board but it’s not to be made public and in our position on the ASX corporate governance council we have argued that companies should report on their performance assessments for example and what gaps have been identified in their skills. But there has been pushback on that, although I know that Woolworths did it in their last annual report I think it was. I think they did it quite well. But typically that information is very much kept within the group. And we don’t think it should be."
38IN,38IN_152,A,"We understand that you can’t say oh yes well this one’s mother died yesterday and they missed this meeting because of that and they thought that this capital idea, they were really concerned about this. Understand that the Board is like a collective and it’s commercial in confidence that is subject to these discussions. But determining a public statement such as it has been identified that we have a skills gap in this particular area and until we recruit somebody we will be hiring in that expertise. We think that is what companies should share. And then we are better able to make judgements about whether we want to vote for any of them."
38IN,38IN_153,Q,Excellent. The final question now. 10 years into the future how would you like to see the diversity of Australian Boards and what role will ASA have in achieving this?
38IN,38IN_154,A,"I would really like to see the gender diversity thing be totally off the table. Even now people are suggesting that there are not enough female CEOs to fill the CEO side of the pipe for Directors. So I would like to see the gender side totally off the table. I would like to see a more mindful recruitment where people do look objectively at what is required on the Board, what skills and the like and then how to fill it and be able to vet people appropriately rather than there is still an element that you don’t want people on the Board that you don’t know. Because sometimes those people don’t just act like mavericks for the benefit of the Board, people who are different may also not have the same values."
38IN,38IN_155,A,"So for example I’m aware of a Board where one of the Directors, it was not a listed company, wouldn’t contribute to the Board and then what hold a press conference after the Board meeting. They would sit through it to not say anything and then go outside and tell the media because it was an organisation going through rupture, tell the media what had been said. So you do need to be able to trust that the person will observe the laws and the spirit and the ethics of the organisation, and that’s where it becomes tempting to get someone just like me as your Board member. And I would hope that we come to a point where we are better able to discern those differences, what differences are important and what similarities are important. So just a more mindful collection of people for the Board."
38IN,38IN_156,Q,And the idea of importance; you say what similarities and what differences are important? Are important?
38IN,38IN_157,A,"Well the importance of the benefit of the company. So you want people who are similar to well, hopefully we all are similar in the sense of I will follow the law, I will follow ethics, I will also make sure that it’s the spirit of the law and dare I say that the company has identified its purpose in the sense that if you’re in the payment system your purpose is to make sure the country functions on a financial level, so that the similarities, other commitments and all those things, and you might achieve that by bringing different skills. But it might be the differences are that you don’t need to tell someone you’re the black hat or the devil’s advocate for the meeting because the way the group dynamics work the third item that is picked up on a particular interrogation of a capital project is do we have an exit strategy?"
38IN,38IN_158,A,"What happens if this goes wrong? How can this go wrong? Anyone can pick that up in the Boardroom. That there is enough dynamics and understanding that someone will go okay, well this group needs to ask the negative question now. I will ask that. So that’s what I mean by knowing what the important things and similarities are and what the important differences are. There might be someone always asking the question, a particular question. What’s the exit strategy, that becomes their thing."
38IN,38IN_159,Q,"That’s fantastic. 38IN, thank you so much. It has been different which is what I want."
38IN,38IN_16,A,Each other.
38IN,38IN_160,A,In a diversity study? Good.
38IN,38IN_161,Q,Pardon?
38IN,38IN_162,A,In a diversity study.
38IN,38IN_163,Q,"Exactly, it’s absolutely imperative in a diversity study. If I get all the same thing I would be worried wouldn’t I? Okay, thank you so much 38IN and I hope you’re having a nice warm day up there because it’s freezing down here."
38IN,38IN_164,A,"I was down there yesterday, well not there but Melbourne yesterday and it was a bit cold and it got sunny. It was pouring with rain. 10 degrees, so that was a plus this morning. And I look forward to reading about it in the future."
38IN,38IN_165,Q,Yeah we’ve got all your email addresses so we will include you all in communications so you can find out where we go from here. Thanks very much 38IN bye.
38IN,38IN_166,A,"Thanks Margot, bye."
38IN,38IN_167,A,End of transcript
38IN,38IN_17,Q,Yeah okay. So when did that change? Or how has it changed?
38IN,38IN_18,A,"It changed rather slowly with being - I would say that when I had this role, I used to be at the ASA in ’03 to ’07 and there were a limited number of female Directors. And maybe a little broadening in the ethnicity. And then I re-joined the ASA in 2017 and with the requirement in the corporate governance council principles and recommendations that 30%, oh no actually I think it might have been the AICD who set the 30% female for ASX 200, that target. We gradually saw that moving and it seemed to move forward for a few years and then kind of get stuck, slip back a bit and now we see that almost all the ASX 200 have at least 30% of their members being women, the diversity across other elements is still a bit vanilla, like unchanging."
38IN,38IN_19,Q,Thank you for that. Not many people have been able to give me such a historical perspective so that’s really helpful.
38IN,38IN_2,A,Accounting financial systems. You mean in terms of degrees?
38IN,38IN_20,A,Age is wonderful isn’t it?
38IN,38IN_21,Q,"Isn’t it wonderful? Yes, exactly. So how does your organisation seek to influence Australian Boards?"
38IN,38IN_22,A,We engage with the Chairs of companies and hold them to account and so with each of the companies that we monitor which is the ASX 200 give or take that - we can't really monitor them if they have their meetings offshore for example so there's about 170 of the ASX 200 we cover. We will meet with those companies Directors or Chairs prior to the AGM and then ask questions at the AGM. Then we also engage with the media through the year with issues that we have. And at the start of the year we work out what our focus issues will be and Board composition has been an important focus issue for some time. Which includes diversity.
38IN,38IN_23,Q,"I noticed that, I’ve got your areas for 2019, the ASA focus areas, that document, that media release. So do you want to speak to that? The focus on Board composition and Director skills, how long? You said it’s been for a number of years you've had this."
38IN,38IN_24,A,"Yes, it pre-dates my joining ASA again in 2017. I think it’s probably gone back some time prior to that because we have been part of the ASX corporate governance council and the working groups working on those principles and we were supportive of that particular criteria, Board diversity, avoidance of groupthink, it’s really important."
38IN,38IN_25,Q,"I’ve got a scale here that I’ve been asking people. If one - if diversity - if a rating of one means it’s not important at all, and 10 means it’s extremely important how would you rate diversity?"
38IN,38IN_26,A,Eight.
38IN,38IN_27,Q,Sorry?
38IN,38IN_28,A,Eight.
38IN,38IN_29,Q,"And so do you think it’s always been important, considered important?"
38IN,38IN_3,Q,"Yeah, no, that’s good."
38IN,38IN_30,A,"By ourselves and people who look into corporate governance yes, it’s always been considered important but it is sometimes difficult for retail shareholders to penetrate the veil of the Boardroom and figure out how this particular group of people operate in a superior fashion to that particular group of people. I think it’s really been driven more by people who are mindful and analytical about how you get the best out of Boards. That that concept of diversity is an important thing. And I think diversity is a chicken and egg thing in that we see that Boards that are more diverse actually perform better."
38IN,38IN_31,A,But some Boards become diverse purely because they’re not - they’re either more analytical themselves and aware of what their biases are or they just look for the best person and they’re not blinkered as to how that person will look or what their CV will look like. That the diverse Boards become because of the way the business is structured and the Board is structured. Or it may be that you bring a diverse Board together and then they become more analytical and more mindful of assessing what is a proper influence or an effective influence they’re experiencing and what is coming from their own biases. Not sure if I conveyed that appropriately?
38IN,38IN_32,Q,"Yeah, so is it whether the diversity of thought is a function of people from different backgrounds getting together or whether -"
38IN,38IN_33,A,"Yeah, they already had the diversity of thought which ended up with different people getting together."
38IN,38IN_34,Q,"Yes, so this Board was like a magnet for people from different backgrounds to come sort of thing?"
38IN,38IN_35,A,"Not necessarily a magnet, that sounds a bit, well I suppose that sounds a bit more like the company is drawing the people in, I think it’s more not rejecting those that are different when you have an applicant for a Board seat and you don’t look at them and go, “Well that one looks just like me, I’ll take that one.” But I suppose if you were a Director and you were looking at joining a Board you - the monocultures like the ARB, you will have to take me out of the room in a box before we get a female Director. I know a lot of Directors would look at that and go yeah, I’ll just wait until you die and then we’ll think about it. It’s not like one you put your hand up to join."
38IN,38IN_36,Q,"Yes, I had one Director said if it wasn't a gender diverse Board I would not apply. Like I don't apply to Boards that are not gender diverse because he saw that as - and it was a male. He saw that as a sign that it was a too conservative - its way of thinking would be too conservative. So it’s a signal for him."
38IN,38IN_37,A,"Yes and I like the sound of that. I think that’s how it should be. I think a lot of the investors are getting to a similar point of view. Although something that’s particularly blinkered may actually have a lot of upsides once it joins the beginning of the century. Oh, maybe just a bit before this century. You know, why bother? Just wait until it has its crisis and then look at it when it has to regroup and reinvent itself."
38IN,38IN_38,Q,Now this is interesting. Coming from an organisation that seeks to influence Boards do you think you play a more proactive role in shaping the Boards rather than -
38IN,38IN_39,A,"No, I think that the AICD requirement [and ACSI] 00:10:05, industry funds being much more strident is more influential. But it does - when the retail shareholders say, “Well, of course you’re doing that, aren’t you?”, that means another impediment is moved out of the way. I just point to the population and say, well, there’s a whole bunch of mum-and-dad investors who believe that male WASP directors are the best. We have to be mindful of our retail shareholders. That’s not available to people, because we are supportive of diverse boards. We actually feel that we don’t get enough information ourselves to make good judgements about boards. So we have this rule that if you had an underperforming board and you’re a CEO or chair of that board, that we won’t support you for the next role."
38IN,38IN_4,A,"Accounting financial systems, postgraduate diploma in applied finance. And years of institutional investment and corporate governance."
38IN,38IN_40,A,"Which having - in the length of my career of being an institutional investor and more on the governance side of these Boards and not as assessments. You can see the Board’s group dynamics, I mean an individual can be in a badly performing Board and be a strong contributor on a well performing Board. It’s probably if they’re clever enough they’ll disengage from the bad performing Board. But retail, just we don’t have enough information about people’s skills and how they’re contributing to be able to say oh well, you were a dud. That was a dud Board and you’ll be great with this one. So we would like more information to be able to make those types of decisions."
38IN,38IN_41,Q,"And so how do you get that information, that additional?"
38IN,38IN_42,A,"We’ve made that one of our focus issues, so when we go and talk with companies, we will raise that issue."
38IN,38IN_43,Q,This is the standard of information in the annual reports?
38IN,38IN_44,A,Yes.
38IN,38IN_45,Q,And highlight the skills of individuals.
38IN,38IN_46,A,"Yes. And when people come to us and say, “How dare you vote against this person”, because the poor female Directors of AMP, some of them have performed well at other Boards and people come and say how dare you vote against them at everything. And it’s like well you really need to give us more information about what these people are adding to the Board so that we can say “Hey, this particular skill is really useful.” It might not have been the priority at that Board that was going under but for this particular company that’s a great skill and experience to bring."
38IN,38IN_47,A,"So we will gauge the companies and when they come back and go oh well you can’t vote against that person just because they did badly and the other company, they were at did badly, we will reinforce that. And we’re trying to with retail shareholders that quite often, from time to time, people will want to say we’ve respected the retail shareholders. So the points that we bring up are the ones that they may address, so skin in the game for example is one of our focus issues and at one time people would say I don’t want to insist but the Directors have to have shares. Whereas now it’s becoming far more common."
38IN,38IN_48,Q,"So that they have a share in the company, the Directors?"
38IN,38IN_49,A,"Shares equivalent to one year’s worth of fees. So it’s substantial considering that you have to pay tax on your fees and that would mean that they accrue it over three to five years but then you basically have to turn your fees back into shares in the company, which if you’re a professional Director becomes a bit trickier because you’re actually eating it and paying your mortgage out of that. Hopefully you’re financially successful."
38IN,38IN_5,Q,"Excellent. Thank you so much. So as you’re aware at La Trobe we’re doing - the business school at La Trobe, we’re doing some research into the diversity of Australian boards and we’ve been interviewing board members to get their perspective and also key organisations such as ASA, who we think influence Australian boards. That’s why we’re having the discussion. So thank you again for agreeing to participate. First have you any questions before we get on?"
38IN,38IN_50,Q,I see.
38IN,38IN_51,A,"But that sort of thing, we see those sorts of things that we request and chip away at, I think it’s the way the companies - as long as the companies are aware of what the top thing is, that they may well, if they can, address that issue. Might not be able to help you on everything but it will be that issue and Board composition is one of those issues for us."
38IN,38IN_52,Q,You mentioned diversity of thinking? I think you said - did you use that term? That that was important. How do you measure that?
38IN,38IN_53,A,"It's really an observational metric. And the assumption is that if you have a bunch of people that don't look like each other and they have different specialities, that that will encourage diversity of thinking which is also a protection against groupthink. Well you can still have quite diverse people who end up getting sucked into a particular chain of action."
38IN,38IN_54,Q,"I was just talking to a Chair who was saying - describing how some techniques he uses to facilitate inclusion and to facilitate thinking from different perspectives, from different points of view through, let’s say, while you’re making choices or decisions you think, right. From this perspective, from the customer perspective, from this customer perspective, from the risk perspective, from a financial. So going through and getting - so he described these techniques he used. He said that helped to avoid groupthink because you could have half women, half men, half people, a good proportion from different ethnic diversities and backgrounds and stuff but everyone can still think the same. That’s what he was - that’s what he’s been doing the last 18 months and he thinks it’s been quite successful. Have you heard anyone else talk about that sort of thing?"
38IN,38IN_55,A,"I haven't heard of people with that in action but I have read about similar things. It’s a bit like in any group you appoint the black hat, it’s the term for the person who is doubting everything, but their job is to actually doubt -"
38IN,38IN_56,Q,Be sceptical.
38IN,38IN_57,A,Yeah. Devil’s advocate.
38IN,38IN_58,Q,Devil’s advocate.
38IN,38IN_59,A,"That’s the thing I was thinking of as well, it’s like how Biblical is that? Yes, you basically tell someone their job is to be the Devil’s advocate. The whole thing about a company, particularly if it’s in a pinnacle of health. So CSL when you look at the outlook in CSL, it seems like it has so many positive challenges that it can undertake and take advantage of opportunities. Being successful means you can be better. But imagine if you’ve got a dire company that’s maybe diminishing and someone comes up with a project. And I’m remembering - remember David Jones, I’m not sure how long he’s had in the market, but when they did that food venture?"
38IN,38IN_6,A,No.
38IN,38IN_60,Q,"Vaguely, really vaguely."
38IN,38IN_61,A,"2002, well it blew up before 2002. But you could just imagine the company’s not doing too well, people are circling thinking maybe if they just sell off their property they’ll make more money? And then they come up with a project. And people don’t want to query the capital decisions and the different assumptions aggressively because they don’t want to stymie all hope. But somebody has to ask, what is the exit strategy, what would happen if this went bad? And rather than having everyone going nah, nah, you nominate a person and you probably nominate the person whose skills are best aligned to it, to this particular discussion."
38IN,38IN_62,A,"You - that person is the black hat or the devil’s advocate. But everybody knows that it’s not them personally. That’s their role in the meeting is actually to make those negatives become apparent, make sure they’re addressed. I’ve heard of, you know, you look through Harvard and McKinsey and the like and there’s all those sorts of different practices which you think a professional Board actually would be able to - an experienced professional Board would probably hand that around. People build their social capital and the person who has got enough social capital can ask that difficult tetchy question. Make sure that the risks are actually all interrogated. So all credit to that Director who is using that technique."
38IN,38IN_63,Q,Yeah. It was interesting. Do you think that there’s a situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating for diversity?
38IN,38IN_64,A,Yes. I reckon if they were - if Boards were generally diverse.
38IN,38IN_65,Q,Sorry if they were what?
38IN,38IN_66,A,"If Boards were generally diverse as opposed to having the ASX 200 just reaching the 30% female and one of the reasons we focused on females I think is because gender diversity is such a large number, you know half the population are female. So it’s really easy to pick, whereas if you pick ethnicity or whether you need IT experience or that sort of thing, the numbers vary so much. I think that if we had Boards that were really diverse, and you think well a bit less diversity is not going to hurt. Because I think that if you had a truly diverse, like a 40% diverse, in a group with [inaudible] 00:20:16, who is a Director, and she’s like female and Asian, and I can’t remember, I think she might be accounting but she basically ticked a couple of diversity boxes in one person."
38IN,38IN_67,A,"You often see that, where people go whoa, this one person is our diversity! So seven of the people are all the same, but the one person ticks some diversity boxes. Well, to me, that is still only 12% diversity, even though you have a multiplicity of diversity in that 12%. But say we had a truly diverse Board, 40%, 50%, 60, 70, then slipping a bit. I think as long as you’ve probably got a base level of 40% total diversity, that the companies who have floated have slipped into groupthink. However if it was running at 70% truly diverse then I wouldn’t think it’s so important, or rather I figure it’s not the thing to choose to change. Because even if it slips back it’s still above a threshold, whether that’s 40 or 50% when we look at all those other characteristics."
38IN,38IN_68,Q,"So you’re saying it’s not important to manage it, it doesn’t become a focus to manage if it’s already diverse but diversity is important because you’re saying you’ve got to have that? Is that right?"
38IN,38IN_69,A,"Well I’m basically saying that it’s a continuum and once you’re above a threshold, provided you stay above that threshold then you have other priorities. If you’re close to that threshold or falling towards that threshold then it would have to go back up in your priorities. You have to ask yourself “Why is this happening?” But if it’s near nicely diverse and you’ve had a changeover of one or two people and it doesn’t change it from being nicely above the threshold I would only start worrying as you lost one or two people. I would be worried about other things."
38IN,38IN_7,Q,Yep good.
38IN,38IN_70,Q,What does Board diversity mean? How do you define it?
38IN,38IN_71,A,"We’ve gone for that simplistic in our focus, this is just the 30%."
38IN,38IN_72,Q,Gender?
38IN,38IN_73,A,"Gender. But we feel that you can’t have all CEO’s, you can’t have no CEO’s, you can’t have no people with experience of operating the style of business, so for Rio for example we’re a little concerned that the actual operating expertise resides in the Chair and the CEO and CFO. Whereas the rest of the Board, none of them have run anything at any time in their careers. Sorry, run, mines. Large mines. In their careers. So we think that there needs to be a certain quantum of people with that sort of experience. You need IT/social media, modern world techniques, exposure in that side, you need accountants, an accountant, a lawyer, everybody needs to have finance understanding."
38IN,38IN_74,A,"Even if they’re an engineer who has had experience running a particular division or the like. The Board just shouldn’t look the same. So you need to have- it’s really weird if they all end up just being born in 1946 for example. Or went to the same school. So basically look different and when you write their credentials down or a blurb about what they do for the company, that needs to look different. My concerns with Wesfarmers where everybody is a Western Australian, who worked at - sorry I don’t mean Wesfarmers, I mean Woodside. But everybody worked at Wesfarmers on the Board. And that’s just a little bit of a concern, it’s got to be too much of a clique. But they’re all grown ups so hopefully they’re all able to argue with each other and have totally different opinions and carry them through."
38IN,38IN_75,Q,"Yeah, so that would be like a social, it’s like an in-group."
38IN,38IN_76,A,"Yeah, like an enclave."
38IN,38IN_77,Q,"Yeah, and so it will influence, undue influence on decision-making because of that."
38IN,38IN_78,A,"Yeah, it can be that your social capital, because you see with Boards and, I know retail shareholders have trouble understanding that you can’t just walk in. Because sometimes it’s hard for a retail shareholder to understand the difference between executives and Boards. Especially if they have been exposed to small companies where that distinction is far less but in the larger companies you turn up to your first Board meeting, you really can’t start critiquing efficiently and effectively in your first meeting. It takes 6 to 12 months because what is laid before you is curated to a great degree, you have to start building behind that but also you need the social capital to be able to pursue lines of enquiry."
38IN,38IN_79,Q,"So given that, what do you think is the ideal tenure, time for Board members?"
38IN,38IN_8,A,"I’m happy to go ahead, yes. I’ll ask anything I need on the way through."
38IN,38IN_80,A,"With the ASA we consider people lose their independence at 12 years. But I really think that if we move to annual elections this might change it. But between nine and 12 years, and then it really depends on the Board itself. So for example if for some reason there has been a disruption, you’ve got someone who has been on the Board for nine years and the others are all new for some reason then that person may well be the Chair even though we would consider that they’re really heavily invested in the earlier decisions of the Board. So we would query their independence at year 10. But if that Board has no other continuity than that person may well be the appropriate Chair, even though we want an independent Chair. And these are the things you have to balance out."
38IN,38IN_81,A,"But a really well curated Board has people joining, their longevity should be dispersed. So you have some people who have three or less years tenure, some with six and less and others with, nine to 11. And the Board should be a living thing. It should be curated so that the older ones start to move on and it may be, I know a lot of people wanted to vote against Andrew Moll in his last role but he was important for a particular divestiture and was leaving after that period. So we have to understand the nature of the Board. It sometimes means that people should be there longer but we really hate seeing a Board like think Gerry Harvey’s Board. The last meeting their most recent appointee may have been 2007. I can actually look that one up. And so it’s obviously not a living thing."
38IN,38IN_82,Q,So what do you to when – how can you influence that?
38IN,38IN_83,A,"When we go and talk to them we ask your job is Mr Chair Miss Chair, to look after this Board. How are you making sure that it’s a living being and, you know, you’re adding people with new experiences and new backgrounds and people who have contributed substantially are retired with great thanks. It’s not like you burnt out or anything but in 10 years you would hope that you had given all you had to give. And again it’s like 10 to 12 years just because of whatever is going on at the time and just with Harvey Norman for example the first Director started in ‘87 which is their listing date, so probably pre-dates that. Until March 2019 the next most recent appointment was their CFO in ’07. So 1987 to ‘07, that was where the Directors sit."
38IN,38IN_84,Q,"Yeah. Wow, that’s incredible."
38IN,38IN_85,A,"Yeah, that doesn’t look like living. A living thing that is supposed to make the company better and keep Directors and keep executives to account and all that sort of stuff."
38IN,38IN_86,Q,"So you go talk to the Board, to the Chair or whatever and then do you communicate to shareholders? How do you?"
38IN,38IN_87,A,"At the AGM with a Board like that, we’d basically vote against them. Well it depends on the independence and the like but we would vote against the Directors in such a Board because really they should be appointing a new Director which they have. And so in that vote against there’s a fair amount of media attention so we would express that to the media. Our voting intentions are made available to our members, so they would be aware that we are voting against. And then we would be advising the company. We try not to broadside the company, we would advise the company that we will be voting against them, and that is the reason for lack of Board renewal."
38IN,38IN_88,A,"And if the company was in a bit of a dire situation – so, at times we have voted for people in one company because they have been important to, say – so, the Chairman of Amcor we consider has too much workload, but they were doing a huge acquisition. So we voted for him, [Graeme Liebelt] 0:30:38.0 in Amcor, but against him in his other roles. Because we considered that he really needed to be continuing with that company, that had – Amcor, which had the acquisition. But we thought he was doing too much, because you always end up with crises happening at every company at the same time. So we voted against him for others. So we go public and we basically tell the people we’re going to vote against, we tell our members, we tell the media."
38IN,38IN_89,Q,"So when you’re using this kind of influence is there any tension, because you’re talking to the Chair so you would probably be privy to information that might not be public. Is there ever a tension between making something public and –?"
38IN,38IN_9,Q,Great. And have I received a consent form for you?
38IN,38IN_90,A,"Yeah. The way listed companies work is that in their engagement with shareholders or shareholder representatives, they are not able - anything that’s disclosed to some needs to be disclosed to all."
38IN,38IN_91,Q,Okay.
38IN,38IN_92,A,"So you would typically have those meetings with the company secretary or an investor relations manager in the room so there is no, and also hold yourself to account so you don’t have selective disclosure or disclose things that can’t be disclosed. Because that’s insider -"
38IN,38IN_93,Q,It’s anti-competitive.
38IN,38IN_94,A,"And it can be insider trading and from my institutional time, if we ever did become privy to anything inside we had to then stop everything in the whole business trading in that. So if you’re at Macquarie for example and one arm of your business is working out a debt prospectus that’s huge for the company, rather than, you know, you’re one of 10 and everyone knows about it. You can’t do anything on that company until it all becomes public. Your clients can’t buy it or sell it, you can’t buy it or sell it, you can’t publish on it. So there will never be anything inside disclosed at those meetings. The only thing is what we say in public needs to be couched in a respectful manner."
38IN,38IN_95,A,"So when we’re talking with these companies and saying we’re going to vote against you because you’ve been on the Board for 18 years and the last person was appointed 10 years ago and we think that you are really letting the company down by not renewing the Board. We would publicly state that to that person, sorry we would state it to the person privately and tell them we’re going to put that in our voting intentions and we’re going to talk about it. And to some degree I suppose there is nothing personal about it, we’re paying attention to a criteria we think is important."
38IN,38IN_96,Q,"That great. That’s quite significant influence that you can use. That’s great. So, are there any other - you talk to the Chair, the Chair is very influential in renewal of Boards and of course the Chair position as well."
38IN,38IN_97,A,Also the person who leads typically a remuneration and nominations committee.
38IN,38IN_98,Q,"Okay, Yep."
38IN,38IN_99,A,"So the Chair of that particular committee is also influential in encouraging a Board to renew. So they would be the two positions we would target if we felt the Board had been stilted by. But we might, depending on how [stultified it is,] 0:34:33.3 we might end up just voting against everyone until they get their act together and appoint a new person."
39DChair,39DChair_1,Q,"Thank you 39D for agreeing to be interviewed for our research on board diversity. So, there’s a lot of talk about board diversity but we’re interested in an Australian perspective and to obtain that information from people who are actually on boards or influence boards so, that’s why we’re talking to you. And look I’ve got from the internet your background so about 25 years board experience."
39DChair,39DChair_10,A,No. It’s the hands-on experience that we have.
39DChair,39DChair_100,A,"I mean that is such an old tradition, I don’t know how that could be disrupted. But it probably needs to be."
39DChair,39DChair_101,Q,"Yeah, okay, that’s really good, thank you 39D. From a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently been promoted through gender target quotas?"
39DChair,39DChair_102,A,"Are you talking about a regulatory perspective? Well there’s no regulation around diversity. The ASX has got principles around reporting diversity and stuff like that. But there’s no regulation; there’s nothing that says you need to have the 40:40:20 rule in place for example. So, there is no regulatory environment around that."
39DChair,39DChair_103,Q,"Okay, so we need to talk about the soft governance of the system in terms of traditions about how chairs are appointed; traditions around targets and shared goals, recognised goals; do you think we need to firm it up and make quotas?"
39DChair,39DChair_104,A,"Do you know who I think needs to apply more pressure, and that is the large investees, sorry investors like the superannuation funds, because at the end of the day we’re talking about the commercial world and money is the language of the commercial world. And I don’t think that the large investors have been exercising enough of their financial power to make sure that the governance structures which includes the board and the composition of the board, are optimised."
39DChair,39DChair_105,Q,"Yeah, excellent. Okay, so the financial lead fellow."
39DChair,39DChair_106,A,Yeah. [over talk] 00:25:43
39DChair,39DChair_107,Q,"So, that will be good, that will link in nicely. Finally, the final question and you’ve got four minutes; looking ten years into the future, how would you like to see diversity of Australian boards and how do you think we can get there?"
39DChair,39DChair_108,A,"Well I’d certainly like to see more gender diversity and more age diversity and more ethnic diversity. And the fact is that Australia is part of the global world. We have a racially mixed population and if we’re looking to be part of the global market, then we need to understand how those particular cultures, those particular parts will work. And what’s going to give us insights, is actually to have people like that sitting around the table with us as fellow Australians, giving us the insights that we need; so, that’s what I’d like to see in ten years. The gender is being addressed. The women of my generation are really pushing it and we’re not going to let it go. And we going to stay completely vigilant for the next 20 years that it stays in place because when you lose the vigilance –"
39DChair,39DChair_109,A,"You know we have a situation like we had when Tony Abbot was our prime minister and we only had one woman around our cabinet table, which was absolutely unacceptable. And so, we as women must remain vigilant that we are fully represented, because we are not a minority. But we need to make sure also that we have around our board tables the sort of people who will represent us as a global citizen and as a global player."
39DChair,39DChair_11,Q,"So, it is a natural barrier."
39DChair,39DChair_110,Q,"Yeah. Look this is completely left of field, if we were exporting say to Muslim countries where women not really tend to be out there, on a board -"
39DChair,39DChair_111,A,"Well certainly it’s the Arab Muslim countries where women - but if you have a look at the situation in Indonesia, there are women who play key roles in those countries."
39DChair,39DChair_112,Q,"Yeah, exactly. But the ones where women are really kept behind closed doors. If we’re gender diverse, our boards, is there a tension between – if they’re a major party in say Saudi Arabia, can you talk to that; because I’m just thinking, yeah but we are in a diverse global economy, however some aspects of the economy are very anti-diversity; so, do we compromise in order to -"
39DChair,39DChair_113,A,"Well you won’t be surprised how pragmatic and opportunistic the Arab Muslim countries are when they’re dealing with Western societies. And also, when the women, and of course, it’s women of a certain class which is wealthy and privileged, how they are represented and behave when they’re outside of their countries. Because a lot of them travel a lot and live outside of their own country for a great part of the year and are very active in the commercial world."
39DChair,39DChair_114,Q,"Okay, so it’s not an issue really."
39DChair,39DChair_115,A,No. At the end of the day you’re talking about money and pragmatism also.
39DChair,39DChair_116,Q,"I love it. 39D, I have taken your time, we’ve finished 30 seconds before, how is that?"
39DChair,39DChair_117,A,"Oh, great, thank you."
39DChair,39DChair_118,Q,That is fabulous thank you so much.
39DChair,39DChair_119,Q,END OF TRANSCRIPT
39DChair,39DChair_12,A,"I think so, yeah. I mean, as I said I think that in this sort of technological age not to bring younger people on, younger people who are potentially your customers, younger people who are more technologically savvy than the older people sitting around the table, I think is a big mistake. But there’s still resistance."
39DChair,39DChair_13,Q,Is there a way to bring that diversity to the board without them actually being a board member with full governance responsibilities?
39DChair,39DChair_14,A,"Well that’s an interesting point. There is a Board Services Program, I don’t know whether you’re aware of that; but it’s mainly in the not-for-profit sector that that operates where younger people are brought on as participants and they can participate but they don’t have any of the fiduciary duties of a director. And very often from the insertion they then are invited to come onto the board because they tend to make a big contribution."
39DChair,39DChair_15,Q,"So, how important do you think it is to have a diverse board?"
39DChair,39DChair_16,A,Absolutely crucial.
39DChair,39DChair_17,Q,"So, would that be on a scale, one to ten, ten is extremely important."
39DChair,39DChair_18,A,"Yeah, a ten."
39DChair,39DChair_19,Q,"Yeah perfect. And do you feel that it’s always been important, and why is it so important?"
39DChair,39DChair_2,A,Yes.
39DChair,39DChair_20,A,"Yes, I do. Well I think it’s hugely important to create the optimum decision-making outcomes that we can possibly create; and that’s the research, I mean, everything has been pointing to that for decades now, but things have been slowly changed, unfortunately."
39DChair,39DChair_21,Q,"Can you give me an example of a decision that you thought illustrates the importance of diversity, without divulging?"
39DChair,39DChair_22,A,"Well I can’t be specific to an organisation but I can certainly tell you that in decisions around a composition of executive teams, that having diverse people around your boardroom table certainly puts pressure on management to ensure that their executive teams, even at the highest levels are more diverse and inclusive."
39DChair,39DChair_23,Q,"Great. No one has mentioned that downward pressure, that’s fantastic; a connection between the two but not expressed it. So, that makes sense because the questions are coming left of field so to speak. Do you think that there’s any situational context where diversity might not be so important in a board?"
39DChair,39DChair_24,A,"No, I don’t but I do think that people do get hung up on 50:50 in the context of gender diversity. I’m a great believer in what’s called the 40:40:20 rule and I also like to talk about minimum numbers of men rather than quotas for women. So, I like to talk about minimum numbers of men, minimum numbers of women and then you have a floating number. So, that’s 40:40:20, so we had a minimum percentage of 40:40for men. And we have a minimum percentage of 40 for women and then we have 20% floating. Sometimes you might have 60% women, sometimes you might have 60% men and it gives that flexibility which I think is very important."
39DChair,39DChair_25,Q,"You’ve worked across all sectors not-for-profits, do you think the not-for-profit sector is predominantly women like there’s a tendency to have some men on board?"
39DChair,39DChair_26,A,"If you have a look actually at the not-for-profit sector, it’s quite interesting. For small not for profits, yes. For not-for-profits that have revenues of over $5 million, the women tend to be taken over by the guys. So, most of those, the larger not-for-profits, achieved by men and they do tend to be men on the board."
39DChair,39DChair_27,Q,"So, we should look at the financial -"
39DChair,39DChair_28,A,"Yes, that’s right, definitely."
39DChair,39DChair_29,Q,Okay. What does diversity mean to you 39D?
39DChair,39DChair_3,Q,"So, first, how has the composition of boards changed over time?"
39DChair,39DChair_30,A,Better decision-making.
39DChair,39DChair_31,Q,Can you give an example; can you illustrate that for me?
39DChair,39DChair_32,A,Well I think I did in terms of the executive management.
39DChair,39DChair_33,Q,Okay. What about the social networks that people have; do you think that’s important as an aspect of diversity?
39DChair,39DChair_34,A,"Absolutely. Because it’s often from our social networks that we learn about what our customers like or don’t like; what they’re looking for? I mean, nowadays through social media we have much more access to that sort of data in a much more broader sense. But I still think that social networks are important for feedback and general intelligence."
39DChair,39DChair_35,Q,"And social economic background, do you think that kind of diversity is important on boards?"
39DChair,39DChair_36,A,Absolutely.
39DChair,39DChair_37,Q,"Yeah. Gender diversity has been debated for a while, how do you feel about the recent inclusion of sexual differences and different orientations; do you think that’s important?"
39DChair,39DChair_38,A,"Well I think it’s important if a society think it’s important. So, it’s now a conversation that’s happening globally within our society, so therefore I do think it’s important, yes."
39DChair,39DChair_39,Q,"Okay. So, do you see social values being an important influence of boards?"
39DChair,39DChair_4,A,"Oh, well there are definitely more diverse boards particularly in terms of gender, I would say. Not so much in terms of different ethnicities or different age. There still seems to be a reluctance to bring on younger people, for example, that may have different perspectives and also, different experiences particularly in a technological age, by older, more mature board members. Although I have to say when I’ve had the opportunity to bring younger people onto boards that I’ve been involved with in the not-for-profit sector and arts, I tend to do that because I think it’s great to have a range of ages as well as a range of different backgrounds."
39DChair,39DChair_40,A,"Absolutely, because the social values of your employees are absolutely crucial to the smooth functioning of the organisation. So, for example a number of the organisations that I’m involved with now have LGBTQI committees and they acknowledge that. And what that does in the context of the organisation, it actually, and this was expressed to me in a very good way, in fact just the other day, that; are you comfortable to bring your whole self to work, to your workplace? And I think that unless your employees are comfortable and also believe that the organisation that they’re working for reflects their values, you’re not going to have a successful workforce. And if you don’t have a successful workforce, you do not have a successful company."
39DChair,39DChair_41,Q,"Okay. So, you’ve got the decision-making of a board and you’ve got the performance of the organisation; you’ve got those two outcomes from diversity. Do you think a particular kind of diversity matters more than others?"
39DChair,39DChair_42,A,"Well for me gender diversity matters because women are not a minority. So, whenever anyone sort of talks about the argument that well, if we open the floodgates to gender diversity, then we’re going to have this sort of diversity and it is complete rubbish. I mean the fact is women are better educated than men in terms of tertiary outcomes and they are not a minority in our society; in fact, they’re a small majority. And so therefore, not to have women equally represented is I think, absolutely ludicrous."
39DChair,39DChair_43,Q,"Excellent. Do you think, when you’re recruiting people, there can be conflict or tension between recruiting people with a collegiate fit and recruiting people who would prevent groupthink on a board?"
39DChair,39DChair_44,A,"On a board it is important to have both. And I don’t think that they’re mutually exclusive. I think that you can be incredibly collegiate and respectful but voice a different point of view. So, I don’t see those two things as being mutually exclusive."
39DChair,39DChair_45,Q,"So, it’s really then the culture of the board, ad hoc managers. Now, look you’ve been a chair of a number, or you are a chair of a number, can you talk to me about how you cultivated the culture, because this is an important aspect and I’m aware of the time?"
39DChair,39DChair_46,A,"What I do is I always make sure that everybody has a voice around the board table. So, what I do is I try and manage meetings so that nobody dominates and that everybody has an opportunity to speak. And if that means that I need to go around the table and individually ask people, ‘what do you think about that,’ I do that. Because of course, in terms of diversity you have introverts and you have extraverts. You have people who are happy to speak about people who are more resistant; so, it doesn’t mean that they don’t have valuable things to contribute, but they’re not as forceful in terms of putting their views forward. So, I always make sure that those people feel absolutely empowered to speak and I invite them to speak."
39DChair,39DChair_47,Q,"Do you mentor behind the scenes, people on the board as part of that role?"
39DChair,39DChair_48,A,"No, I don’t necessarily mentor people on the board but what I do is I talk to my board directors, fellow colleagues, in-between meetings."
39DChair,39DChair_49,Q,"All right, give feedback, encourage, whatever."
39DChair,39DChair_5,Q,"Yeah, we’ll follow that through a little, what are the barriers to recruiting people onto boards who are younger?"
39DChair,39DChair_50,A,"Yeah, that’s right. And you know what, and I receive the same from them. So, it’s not just me encouraging them or giving them feedback, it’s me getting that from them; how am I going; what do you think of how the business is going? Do you know what I mean, because I’m a very good communicator and I think that that communication is really crucial in-between board meetings."
39DChair,39DChair_51,Q,"Excellent. And so, that is not seen as a lack of transparency and openness."
39DChair,39DChair_52,A,"On the contrary, it is seen as being very transparent and very open."
39DChair,39DChair_53,Q,Excellent. Do you think diversity can contribute to conflict on the board?
39DChair,39DChair_54,A,"Absolutely and it’s the way it’s managed, usually by the chair. But often by colleagues just sitting around the table. And I think it goes back to your point about collegiality and respect. So, if there’s collegiality and respect, there can be conflict. That’s fine, but it just needs to be managed."
39DChair,39DChair_55,Q,"Yeah. Can you give me an example of how conflict, let’s say where the small ‘c’ is managed and how a big ‘c’ is avoided, where it’s disruptive or whatever?"
39DChair,39DChair_56,A,"Look I can think back onto a situation, only a couple of times where I felt that colleagues behaviours have not been appropriate, where I have not been chair and where I have actually called the chair after the meeting and said, 'I thought that colleague’s behaviour was out of line and I think that you need to call them up and explain to them why it was out of line and why you’re not going to put up with it? And if they don’t like it, they can leave the TAL board."
39DChair,39DChair_57,Q,Did it work?
39DChair,39DChair_58,A,"Yeah it did. It usually does. So, it goes to your point about transparency and openness. You need to have a chairman who can be frank and fearless."
39DChair,39DChair_59,Q,"Yeah. Have you been in a situation where you’re not chair, and the chair has been weak and has not done that kind of thing and what has been the result?"
39DChair,39DChair_6,A,Not enough experience.
39DChair,39DChair_60,A,Yeah. I left the board.
39DChair,39DChair_61,Q,Why?
39DChair,39DChair_62,A,"Because I’m not happy that the organisation has been properly governed and that can lead to – it will be issues for me as a director. So, I’d rather not be in that situation."
39DChair,39DChair_63,Q,"Great. So, do you think if it’s a diverse board, it’s even more important that the chair is able to manage conflict, the culture of the board and the governance?"
39DChair,39DChair_64,A,"Well I guess that’s why historically boards haven’t been diverse because the network, I won’t necessarily call it the old boy network, but the network has been familiar; you’ve got people who look alike, who sound alike who are from the same type of background sitting around the table all agreeing with each other. So, of course diversity is going to require more management. But as I said, I think that’s a good thing."
39DChair,39DChair_65,Q,"Great. Do, you think then in the interest of promoting or building diversity, do we need chairs having been cultivated with more skills to manage these kinds of diversity and the complexities that arise?"
39DChair,39DChair_66,A,"Yeah. One would hope that through their executive experience that they would have developed that because let’s face it, work forces are their very nature to diverse. If you look back at the history of Australian companies, I think that there have been some very mediocre chairmen who probably haven’t had that sort of experience and who probably never thought that they needed it. And the organisations have suffered as a result. I guess, subjects like in the MBAs like organisational behaviour, address those sorts of issues. But then, if you look at the amount of chairmen currently on the ASX, a lot of them have very sort of ordinary single degrees and have never advanced beyond that. So, they’ve either learned by experience or they’ve not learned, and the board isn’t necessarily governed as well as it could be."
39DChair,39DChair_67,Q,"So, if you’re looking to recruit, would you include – you’d look for diverse credentials?"
39DChair,39DChair_68,A,Oh definitely.
39DChair,39DChair_69,Q,"Very good. So, what might you look for when you’re thinking about building diversity on the board?"
39DChair,39DChair_7,Q,What kind of experience?
39DChair,39DChair_70,A,"Oh, I look for all sorts of diversity; particularly today, in any business that I would be looking to recruit for a board for, I would be looking for aged diversity and also innovation and technology. Because even though you might be in an industry where you think what you need is a lawyer and an accountant and someone with industry specific knowledge, you need somebody who’s got technology and innovation, because these are people who see what your future’s going to look like. And I think also, you always need somebody from outside the industry who has a different perspective and who also brings experience of their industry into the mix which I think is very important, because we all learn from each other or we all hope we learn from each other."
39DChair,39DChair_71,Q,Okay. And they are all things available from just a CV.
39DChair,39DChair_72,A,Yeah.
39DChair,39DChair_73,Q,"Do you look for someone who’s got an arts background as well as a law background, so that sort of credentialing, do you look for that?"
39DChair,39DChair_74,A,Are you talking about for a business board?
39DChair,39DChair_75,Q,"Yes, for the sort of boards you’ve been on, all your range?"
39DChair,39DChair_76,A,"Well I wouldn’t necessarily look for somebody from an arts background to go onto a property industry board. But I would look for someone who potentially has for example, an engineering degree to go onto a property industry board. But also, somebody who’s potentially got an arts law background. When I say arts law, I mean, a humanities background. So, I would be looking for people with a science background and for people with a humanities background as well. I think the humanities is very important, and you know in these days a focus on STEM. I think if we think about where the creative ideas all come from, it’s usually from humanities, not from science."
39DChair,39DChair_77,Q,"Great. So, when you’re identifying potential members, do you use recruitment organisations to help you or do you use your networks, or does it depend on -"
39DChair,39DChair_78,A,All of the above.
39DChair,39DChair_79,Q,"All of the above. So, if it’s a large business organisation, would you tend to definitely use a recruitment organisation or a small one -"
39DChair,39DChair_8,A,"Well governance experience and even I guess, having experienced different sorts of cycles within industry and businesses."
39DChair,39DChair_80,A,"Well I think in terms of governance you have to, because you need to make sure that you’re covering off the field."
39DChair,39DChair_81,Q,"Okay. So, in the past you said if there’s not enough women on the boards, is it in part because people haven’t been using recruitment organisations or were recruitment organisations contributing to that underrepresentation of women in the past?"
39DChair,39DChair_82,A,"Yeah, I think they were."
39DChair,39DChair_83,Q,Are they now; has that changed you think?
39DChair,39DChair_84,A,Some of them do.
39DChair,39DChair_85,Q,"So, do you select them based on –"
39DChair,39DChair_86,A,I do.
39DChair,39DChair_87,Q,"- and is that easily available, that information; where is it, I haven’t seen it?"
39DChair,39DChair_88,A,Yes. You mean which recruitment agency sees – just talk to women directors.
39DChair,39DChair_89,Q,"I just talk to them, okay, use your networks."
39DChair,39DChair_9,Q,Is this something schools could address do you think?
39DChair,39DChair_90,A,"Yes, that’s right. You pretty much know who’s good and who’s not."
39DChair,39DChair_91,Q,Okay. Do boards that you’re familiar with have any barriers to managing or building diversity and what might they be?
39DChair,39DChair_92,A,"It’s usually the chairman. So, if the chair isn’t pro-diversity, then it’s not going to happen. I mean, in fact it was interesting to see there was a Tweet today that said that the 500 companies in the S&P listings in the US, none of them do not have at least one woman on the board, whereas in Australia we still have four companies that don’t have women on their boards."
39DChair,39DChair_93,Q,"Yeah, it’s amazing, isn’t it? So, because I know within the banks, the chair has sort of lost their jobs, how important is the chair nowadays?"
39DChair,39DChair_94,A,"Hugely. The leadership comes from the chair; the governance, the values, the collegiality, the respect, the smooth working and the relationship between CEO and chair is crucial."
39DChair,39DChair_95,Q,Well what are we doing to cultivate good chairs?
39DChair,39DChair_96,A,"Good question. We’ve had a lot of very unqualified men in those roles for a very long time, haven’t we?"
39DChair,39DChair_97,Q,"Yeah, so perhaps that’s an opportunity for us to actually try and cultivate."
39DChair,39DChair_98,A,"Yeah, I think that there’s a real issue with the chairman nominating their successors because the way it works is very often just a tap on the shoulder to a mate."
39DChair,39DChair_99,Q,"Yeah. So, could that be regulated?"
3D,3D_1,Q,"Okay, [the participant] , thank you so much for agreeing to the interview for this research into diversity on Australian boards. The interview should go for less than an hour, and you know Paul. I’m Margo [Sheehan] 00:00:16, the senior research fellow for the project. Are there any questions you had before we go ahead?"
3D,3D_10,A,They do.
3D,3D_100,Q2,And they’re usually very skilled at managing -
3D,3D_101,A,"Exactly, and as I said, our chair is pretty good at that, and – but it’s done slightly differently in terms of he will usually not say his piece until everybody else has finished, rather than say, “Here’s what I think. What do you all think?” It’s, “What do you all think?” and then, “Okay, this is my take on it.” Yes, so definitely third party facilitation for those sorts of things is -"
3D,3D_102,Q2,[Big things] 00:30:23.
3D,3D_103,A,Yes.
3D,3D_104,Q,"Back to the chair, because you’re – this has been coming up in the interviews, as the role is key – is there training or development for chairs to do this well?"
3D,3D_105,A,"There is training, but I’m not sure it’s any use."
3D,3D_106,Q,Really?
3D,3D_107,A,The AICD does have training for chairs. I’m not sure it’s entirely useful.
3D,3D_108,Q,Why do you say that?
3D,3D_109,A,"Just from anecdotal evidence from people who’ve been there, saying those who’ve done the AICD course and said it was really great, but the chairing a board course is not that good. I think really partly it’s because it comes down to the individual’s personality and skills."
3D,3D_11,Q,Okay.
3D,3D_110,Q,"What, the facilitating -"
3D,3D_111,A,"Yes, if you have those skills, and if you have that sort of personality. If you’re fairly dominant that’s kind of hard to do, but you have to be dominant enough not to let things run off, but not so dominant that nobody else gets to put their – or is afraid to say anything that negates anything that you’ve just said."
3D,3D_112,Q,Yes. So it’s more of an innate skill?
3D,3D_113,A,"I think there are some innate skills. I think it comes down to experience. I really – it’s – I’ve been on a couple of boards, and I think it makes a big difference. Chairing is definitely a skill, and it’s an art as much as a science, I think. You have to play the people the right way. Also – I think that’s also an argument for not having very short board terms, because I think it’s very hard for, A) people to get to know each other, but also for the chair to get to know the individual. If they are there a year and then they’re gone, which happens in some organisations – it’s typically more of a committee-type thing rather than a board of an organisation, but yes. Often people are fairly quiet the first six months, or maybe a bit longer."
3D,3D_114,Q,Yes. So how long has your board position -?
3D,3D_115,A,Ours are three years.
3D,3D_116,Q,"Three years, and the chair is the same?"
3D,3D_117,A,"The chair is elected every year. All office bearers are elected every year. Committee heads are appointed every year. Chairs, and vice-chairs, and treasurer are elected every year."
3D,3D_118,Q,Is that typical of state sector -?
3D,3D_119,A,Yes.
3D,3D_12,A,"They make the appointment. The shortlisting is ours, but the final choice is down to the minister."
3D,3D_120,Q,Okay.
3D,3D_121,A,In the health sector anyway.
3D,3D_122,Q,"Yes, in the health sector. You can’t speak about other types of boards?"
3D,3D_123,A,"No. Not in the state sector, no."
3D,3D_124,Q,"Yes. Well, what about the for-profit then?"
3D,3D_125,A,"I think chairs are usually there as long as they want to be, until you are usurped in some way, for a lot of organisations. That’s why there’s a deliberate – they have to be re-elected every year, but most people don’t want to put their hand up for it anyway."
3D,3D_126,Q2,[Big enough time to have] 00:33:25 fixed terms? Yes.
3D,3D_127,A,Yes. But usually they’re reappointed -
3D,3D_128,Q2,"But often the constitutions will have, “No more than X –”"
3D,3D_129,A,"Yes, “X” total years of director plus chair – yes."
3D,3D_13,Q,Right. You mentioned age – so you said – so what’s the process around -?
3D,3D_130,Q,"Okay. In your experience, how are new board members selected? We talked a little bit about it."
3D,3D_131,A,"How are they selected? As I said – well, we have criteria. We have several pieces of input. One is our own – every year we construct a skills matrix around the board and see what’s missing, with having regard to who might be retiring or stepping down for this year. So we see what gaps there are, and what we’ve got, and what we’ve maybe got too much of and not enough of. So that’s one piece of input. The other piece of input is the vibe from the minister at that particular time. There are often directives from the department, from – there’s directive from the secretary and from the minister, and they usually – they sometimes are oblique but often they’re quite blunt and say, “You must do this. You must – we would look very favourably upon X, Y, Z.” So -"
3D,3D_132,Q,"And that would be someone – a medical someone from a medical background, or a particular person?"
3D,3D_133,A,"Yes, because hospital boards used to be – basically consist only of clinicians, and then they caused havoc and so they got rid of that. Then they had the opposite problem: there was nobody who understood clinical issues. So at the moment the big push is clinical governance. That’s a huge push in the hospital sector at the moment after the [Garrawarra] 00:35:23 issues, and some other ones. So that’s been a huge push, and so there’s been a push to get some clinical – not necessarily clinicians, but people with an understanding of clinical governance."
3D,3D_134,Q,So it can be nursing? Or it has to be medical?
3D,3D_135,A,"No, it doesn’t have to be medical, but there is a push to get at least one clinician onto the board – one medical clinician on the board. So there’s that piece of input, and the rest is, from time-to-time they change the criteria. The government – the department changes the criteria. Was it last year? No, the year before – there’s now an advisory board for health board appointments that comes out with recommendations from on high about, “This is what we should be doing.” So they set up criteria as well."
3D,3D_136,Q,Who runs that?
3D,3D_137,A,"That’s an independent board reporting to the minister, I think."
3D,3D_138,Q,Advisory committee for -
3D,3D_139,A,"I think it’s called health board appointments, or something. It was a part of a slew of things that came up with – following the [Garrawarra] and the [Towards Zero] 00:36:38 Report."
3D,3D_14,A,"There is some drive to get a bit more youth into the – I’m on a board in the health sector, a hospital board – and there’s some drive to get a few younger people onto the boards. We have – I think we’ve got a couple in the 60s range, and three or four in the 50s, a bunch in the 40s and two in the 30s, because that’s been a particular – because we particularly went out to put that in our list of – we have a matrix of – we have a skills matrix that we have to hire to, and we also have then some diversity requirements, yes."
3D,3D_140,Q,"Okay, so it’s probably recommended in the [Duckett] Report."
3D,3D_141,A,"Yes, it was in the [Duckett] Review. Yes, it was. Yes, and we – everything that’s [Duckett] we take as -"
3D,3D_142,Q,-@ gospel?
3D,3D_143,A,"Our CEO was also working on that review with [Duckett] so we’ve had lots of presentations from him. Yes, we tend to go that way. Yes, so there’s that criteria, so – people that apply have to rate themselves against that criteria. You can only pick three out of the eight areas that you say you have expertise in, and you have to rate them, and that gives you an explanation of – so if you say “law” – it’s one to five or something – and if you give yourself a five in law, you have to have a law degree and be admitted to practice, preferably in either corporate governance or health law."
3D,3D_144,A,"So that’s how you – it helps you determine – with accounting and finance you have to be an accountant or a financial something or other, and have to have a degree and whatever. So that’s – are you talking about process now of appointing people, or are you talking about thinking about it? Or what are you -"
3D,3D_145,Q,"Yes, it’s how new board members are selected."
3D,3D_146,Q2,"With a particular twist on diversity. So what we’re really after is how the selection process is fashioned, but with a particular regard to – I think it’s well established that if you’re short of accountants you get accountants."
3D,3D_147,A,"Yes, but that’s part of the diversity criteria that we have."
3D,3D_148,Q2,"Correct, correct, but looking at some of the other stuff as well -"
3D,3D_149,A,"There are no – there is no guidance from the department about any other diversity, except for gender diversity. So we make those determinations ourselves. We determine what sort of other people we might like on the board, whether that’s age or whether that’s local community affiliations, et cetera. The board determines that themselves. So we get – the board has a conversation about that, and gives writing orders to the committee – the sub-committee that deals with that. The department and the minister have determined the approach to gender diversity."
3D,3D_15,Q,"Okay, so when you say there’s an informal push, is this coming from the state or from within your board?"
3D,3D_150,A,"We have to abide by those rules. We are aiming for 50/50 with our female board membership, and also, as I said in the list of shortlisted candidates we want to put up as close to 50/50 – meaning we have to put up 50/50. In reality, we have to. Otherwise there’d be questions. They’ll – we can, but there will be questions."
3D,3D_151,Q,"Yes, it will come back -"
3D,3D_152,A,"If we get one female applicant and they’re rubbish in terms of fit, then we can not, but we have to be prepared to answer a lot of questions. Yes."
3D,3D_153,Q,"Your skills diversity list, I was wondering, could we have a look at that? Is that something you can -?"
3D,3D_154,A,"Yes, maybe. I could ask. I could see."
3D,3D_155,Q,If you can? It would be great if you could. Yes. But is that a way to justify your list?
3D,3D_156,A,"Without names on it, obviously."
3D,3D_157,Q,Yes. Yes. No names on it -
3D,3D_158,A,Sorry?
3D,3D_159,Q,"- justify – it can show that, “Look, no female applied with an appropriate skill mix?” Is it used in that sort of [comprehensive] 00:40:12 way to -"
3D,3D_16,A,Yes.
3D,3D_160,A,"Well, the matrix that we create when we get the responses, we have to set up a matrix with all the people who applied, the way they’ve rated themselves on all skills, male/female, local – whatever. Then, are they suitable for shortlisting or not suitable for shortlisting, et cetera. So that matrix is created and we use that to – we send that to the department and say, “This is who we are shortlisting.” On occasion they come back and say, “No, you’re going to talk to that person as well.” We have had that. But usually -"
3D,3D_161,Q,"On diversity grounds, was it?"
3D,3D_162,A,"I believe that particular one might have been on they were a medical practitioner, I think. I don’t think it was on – it certainly wasn’t on gender diversity, but I think in that case that that’s what it was. I can’t quite remember. I think that’s what it was. So yes, we have to justify why we’re interviewing the people we want to interview – the people we want to interview – on all sorts of grounds."
3D,3D_163,Q,"I get a picture for how it works, yes. So you research – the board’s – sorry, there’s some research that suggests that boards should consider cognitive diversity as part of selection. You’ve said that whether male or female, or things like an accountant, and whether male/female – lawyers -"
3D,3D_164,A,"Well, if they’ve got the same background, yes."
3D,3D_165,Q,"Yes, same background, same school, whatever – so very similar. So what do you understand by cognitive diversity and do you think it matters? What role does it play?"
3D,3D_166,A,"Yes, it certainly does matter, for the reasons I mentioned before. It’s your entire approach to discussion. It’s your entire approach to decision-making and deliberation and working with others."
3D,3D_167,Q2,"I think you’ve talked about that in terms of skill diversity, et cetera."
3D,3D_168,A,"Yes, and so – yes. Obviously it makes a big difference to the way you just approach life. I’m on a board, so I’m hesitant to say too much there, just because I teach a subject called “Ethics and Diversity”. So there’s lots of – yes. I don’t want to talk about stuff that’s not really my own viewpoint."
3D,3D_169,Q,"Okay, sure. Have you seen – can you give an example of how it’s worked well, and how it hasn’t? Apart from the marriage one, I guess."
3D,3D_17,Q,From the state?
3D,3D_170,A,"Well, I think in most of the decisions that require discussion, and they are usually fairly obvious, but sometimes not – sometimes things come up and you go, “I hadn’t thought of it that way.” That’s typically how that manifests itself. People go, “Oh, I’d never actually thought of it that way.” That’s usually – I think that’s usually been because somebody is a member of a group that others are not members of. For example, we have one board member who has got very small children, and there was something that came up, and it was a very different point of view from those whose kids were 35 or teenagers or whatever. So I think it’s a – it’s that sort of, “I hadn’t considered that, because it doesn’t really apply to me.” Yes."
3D,3D_171,Q,Okay. Did you want to say something?
3D,3D_172,Q2,"Yes, I just wanted to say – as I said, I think we talked about the cognitive diversity before, but do you – in your experience, is things like gender, ethnic, social, those physical characteristics and blah-blah – is that a good predictor of cognitive diversity, or not?"
3D,3D_173,A,"I think in some they are, but not each – any particular one. I think you have to take them in combination with each other."
3D,3D_174,Q,Meaning?
3D,3D_175,A,"Meaning gender, plus ethnicity, plus socioeconomic – if you’ve been an academic for ten years, probably you have a lot of similarities with other academics who’ve been around for a while. You may be very different to somebody who’s got their first job as a level A academic after just finishing a PhD. It’s a combination of things. That’s something I think you haven’t touched on, but length of tenure is definitely part of that cognitive diversity picture – how long you’ve been on the board, how well you know the other people. But it’s that sort of intersectional idea. As I said, if you’re a lawyer and have gone to a Melbourne private school and been to Melbourne University, whether you’re male or female may not be as much – it might bring – in some conversations – in others, of course it will make some difference, but you may not get the diversity of thought from that diversity."
3D,3D_176,A,"In others, it will. I was talking to somebody who employs lawyers and says that they really – they like to employ lawyers from the law school, because they’re often first in the family to go to university - they’ve struggled, they’ve scrambled, they’ve got through it – rather than people whose parents were lawyers and whose grandparents were lawyers, and yada yada. It’s a different way of thinking. Even though they’ve both done a law degree, it’s a different way of thinking. So I think it’s a combination."
3D,3D_177,Q,"Okay, that’s good. Does your board consider ways to increase the board’s cognitive diversity when identifying potential new members? Given it’s so hard to identify, does it actually try to cultivate -?"
3D,3D_178,A,"By proxy. By all those things, by those skills. The differences – you have to do it by proxy. You get to interview someone for half an hour or whatever it is. You get some idea. But it’s by proxy."
3D,3D_179,Q,"Okay. So all things being equal, in a scenario where you’ve one board vacancy only, would you prefer this vacancy to be filled by a candidate who increases demographic diversity – for example gender, ethnicity, age, social diversity – or cognitive diversity?"
3D,3D_18,A,"From the state, but also internally. There’s a fair bit of conversation about that. Internally it’s mostly around office bearers and committee chairs. So the president – well, it used to be – that’s just been changed now. It’s now called the chair of the board, but they were called the president of the management committee, or something – but – so the chair is male, and has been there for a while. We now have two deputy chairs, one male, one female, and the committee chairs – I just [wrote] 00:04:19 that down for that reason – committee chairs we’ve got two male committee chairs, and five female committee chairs. So basically the leadership positions are – they try to balance that out a little bit."
3D,3D_180,A,It depends what already exists.
3D,3D_181,Q,It depends on what already exists.
3D,3D_182,A,So if we have a big -
3D,3D_183,Q2,All other things being equal -
3D,3D_184,A,"Yes, well – it’s a get out of jail card. Yes. Ceteris paribus. That’s great. It’s an experiment. Well, personally, if everything was equal, and we already had the same amount of cognitive diversity on the board as we have demographic diversity already existing, and this person will be adding to one or other of the aspects of diversity – if that’s what you’re asking -"
3D,3D_185,Q2,That’s the – yes.
3D,3D_186,A,"- Probably cognitive diversity, I think. but I would be greedy and go outside the square and Say, “Why not both?” and look for somebody with both then."
3D,3D_187,Q,Cognitive diversity and gender.
3D,3D_188,A,If you can. But no experiment is ever constructed that way.
3D,3D_189,Q,"Yes. Anyway, the point there also was to look at, “Well, can sometimes gender trump because of the situation?”"
3D,3D_19,Q,"Okay. So you’ve got age and gender. Anything else, like economic background, cultural background?"
3D,3D_190,A,"It can in our case for sure, absolutely. In our board, yes it can, because of the rules that we have – the minister said, “You must -” so we do."
3D,3D_191,Q,"And also, you might be opening a whole new range of services for women, for babies. You might be opening the replacement for – then do you want – would you go for women -"
3D,3D_192,A,"Well, they’re board members. They’re not operational, so maybe not as – it’s not as big as a driver really. I can see the point, but yes, we do have – we have quite strict rules and so we follow those. So for the choice between some cognitive diversity and we are short of a female board member, then we will get a female board member. If we don’t, we’ll send it to them and they’ll change it, which has happened."
3D,3D_193,Q,"Okay, so strategy is overwritten by the rules. How convenient. Board diversity seems to be quite complex. There are different kinds of diversity and the relative importance probably differs, and the usefulness or riskiness of different kinds of diversity can depend on the situation that the company is facing. Have you any last comments on this complexity before we move onto cultivating?"
3D,3D_194,A,"On complexity – a lot of the risk that the board is willing to take on appointing people depends on who’s already on the board, and if it’s in a happy state. So I think on our board we could probably say yes to almost anyone and say, “We’ll make them fit in some way,” or, “We’ll deal with them.” If it’s a bit more fractured I think it’s quite difficult to do. But I think that’s – I think you can drive yourself completely mad. What I didn’t say in the process part was – we have a governance remuneration sub-committee of the board who deals with the board appointments, as well as CEO stuff."
3D,3D_195,A,"So there’s usually a smaller group of people that deal with all the staff and drive themselves mad, and I’ve done that on previous occasions, [touring agencies] 00:50:24, et cetera, and then present that to the board and say, “Are you okay with this?” But you can drive yourself mad if you don’t take a punt at some stage and go, “Look, I think this person will fit. They’ll grow into the role. They’re missing this and this, but they’ve got these good things over here. We’ll take a risk and do that.”"
3D,3D_196,Q,"Okay, good. A nice picture of a resilient [ford] 00:50:44. So cultivating diversity – does your board do anything to cultivate new potential members?"
3D,3D_197,A,"Yes. As I said, we try and get people on the sub-committees, but also, for example, we were sitting around talking about sub-committee membership, because that changes – can change every year. Somebody said, “We’ve got [a vid of] 00:51:11 renewal in this committee,” because somebody left the board, and a new committee chair – “We should see this more often,” and I said, “Okay, fine. [Ange] 00:51:19, do you want to be -?” because I was chair of the governance remuneration committee – I said, “Well, are you interested?” She said, “Yes, okay, fine.” You just – because she’d been on the committee for a year or so, and she’s a lawyer, she was able to step up to that."
3D,3D_198,Q2,"So these – in terms of cultivating potential, future directors, et cetera, are these sub-committees or families, whatever you call them in your domain, are they entirely board members?"
3D,3D_199,A,No.
3D,3D_2,A,No.
3D,3D_20,A,"There’s certainly skills diversity. We have – cultural background, not so much. Certainly in terms of skills, yes. We have requirements for certain skills which must be present on a board: legal; accounting; there has to be a clinician, of some sort on the board -"
3D,3D_200,Q,So you put in people [from outside] 00:51:56?
3D,3D_201,A,"You can, yes."
3D,3D_202,Q,"So, is that then seen as a mechanism to test people?"
3D,3D_203,A,"Not so much test, but allow them to – see whether they’re interested."
3D,3D_204,Q,Get a feel for it.
3D,3D_205,A,"Yes, get a feel for it, see whether they’re interested."
3D,3D_206,Q,[Like an advert.] 00:52:10
3D,3D_207,A,"Whether they can – yes, test in the other sense of test. Yes, to make sure they’re interested and – do people – a lot of people really don’t know what goes on in those situations. So it’s not all shouting and carrying on and making wild decisions. It’s discussing the accounts for the last finances, whatever."
3D,3D_208,Q,Sub-committees?
3D,3D_209,A,"Sub-committees, yes. I think – local community members who want to be involved, we find a way of involving them."
3D,3D_21,Q,Because it’s a hospital?
3D,3D_210,Q,What about appointments of CEs and things like that? Giving people senior management experience? Making sure that’s a diverse – that diversity happens there.
3D,3D_211,A,"Well, that’s – the board tends not to get too much involved in the next level down, but we have – except in terms of continuity planning, succession planning – we have noted the progress of the deputy CEO in terms of their ability to step up when the CEO – I’ll just give you a quick sketch. Our CEO is seen as a shining light in the health department. Everybody loves her. The minister loved her. So another neighbouring health service found themselves suddenly without a CEO, and came to us for help and said, “Could we borrow yours for the part-time please?” because they were out of – they were in danger of not being compliant, and that’s a bad thing."
3D,3D_212,A,"So we set up something so that she is now currently the CEO of both [Karrington] 00:54:01 Health Service and [Hepburn] Health Service, which services that whole shire out there. So the deputy CEO, we created that position, and allowed the person who was director of nursing to step up into that role and to get more of a – because she had applied the previous round for CEO of our hospital, and was unsuccessful in getting that position. So there is a bit of that, but not too much of it."
3D,3D_213,Q,"Okay, and that’s – do you think in terms of diversity, or just -"
3D,3D_214,A,"It’s a bit difficult in terms of diversity, because you have to have a particular skillset to be the CEO. You have to have pretty much – you have to be either a medical administrator, or you have to be a nursing director. There’s pretty much – you don’t have too much other choice. We’re a bit constrained in that regard."
3D,3D_215,Q,Okay. Do you send people off to courses and things with a view of helping them -
3D,3D_216,A,Lots of stuff. Yes. There are a lot of development activities for senior staff.
3D,3D_217,Q,"And a [unclear] 00:55:03 of diversity, not just gender, but -"
3D,3D_218,A,We don’t have a lot of diversity in our senior staff. They are all females of about 50-plus. All of them. I think that’s just the way it works.
3D,3D_219,Q,It’s the demographic.
3D,3D_22,A,"Because it’s a hospital. But you’re not allowed to have more than two clinicians, but you have to have at least one -"
3D,3D_220,A,"Yes. Nursing is very, very female-dominated, and by the time you percolate up to those positions you tend to be 50-plus, so they’re pretty much -"
3D,3D_221,Q,"In that age group. Yes. Good, so more generally, how do you think diversity should be increased in Australian company boards?"
3D,3D_222,A,This – is that the quota question?
3D,3D_223,Q2,We’ll come to that.
3D,3D_224,Q,"Yes, you can answer that one, if you want."
3D,3D_225,A,"Yes. I personally – I prefer targets to quotas. I think – it’s a difficult question, because there are still a number of people who are incredibly resistant to any change. And so it’s difficult to know how to do that. I don’t know whether there’s an incentive that you can provide. Certainly rule changes are useful. Certainly in the state-owned sector, in state-owned entities, rule changes are very helpful. For example, the changes made to tenure – because there had been people who’d been on a board for 20, 30 years. You are never going to get change when somebody has been on a board for that -"
3D,3D_226,Q,"- for that long, yes."
3D,3D_227,A,"- the record was 43, I believe, 43 years."
3D,3D_228,Q,Shit.
3D,3D_229,A,"Now, it was a woman."
3D,3D_23,Q,Does it have to be a doctor?
3D,3D_230,Q,Was it?
3D,3D_231,A,She was 90-something.
3D,3D_232,Q,Wow.
3D,3D_233,Q2,You’re kidding me.
3D,3D_234,A,No.
3D,3D_235,Q,"Well, that’s age diversity."
3D,3D_236,A,"Yes, they tried to get rid of her a few times, but no, she was a local legend and the community wouldn’t have it. But – so rule changes can help, because when you get those entrenched people – we were already at around 50/50. I think we were 45/55 or something, and so it helps. It absolutely can help."
3D,3D_237,Q,"It can help with demographic, but cognitive diversity?"
3D,3D_238,A,"No. No, totally, it can’t. You can’t legislate for cognitive diversity. I think that’s pretty hard. It’s up to the board to do that. The board should be – as long as they’re aware of that, then they can try and select for various things that will make life better."
3D,3D_239,Q,And quotas won’t get in the way of that. Because you’ve said there’s only – it’s a coupling of different demographics that -
3D,3D_24,A,"No, it doesn’t. So at the moment we have no doctors on our board. We did have, but at this certain moment we have no doctors. We have the CEO of a very large metropolitan hospital on the board, who is a – was a nurse. And we’ve got, I think, a physio. But – yes. In terms of culture, not so much. In terms of community more – we try and make sure that there’s a balance between out-of-towners, if you like, and people who live in the local – because it’s a service that services the [Macedon Ranges] 00:05:58. It’s a catchment area. So we try and have a mix of people who are local to the [Macedon Ranges], as well as a whole bunch who aren’t."
3D,3D_240,A,"Quotas – I find quotas a bit problematic for many reasons, but I can see the point behind them, because some people will not change unless you make them change. There’s that, as I said, rule changes, but maybe there are rules that are not quite so – don’t have maybe the side effects of quotas."
3D,3D_241,Q,What might they be - the side effects of quotas?
3D,3D_242,Q2,A couple of the big issues -
3D,3D_243,A,"I think you’ll end up with people on boards who are there because they want to be on a board, not because they necessarily have the right skillset or background or whatever, or somebody wants them to be on a board. There have been a lot of changes because of pushes from various groups. We get a lot of applications that come through a group called Women on Boards. We get a lot of applications. We also get a lot of applications, which are being pushed, for example, by the colleges – the medical colleges. They say, “You know, you should – you’re a senior surgeon. You should get board experience. You should go and apply for these things,” through the AICD, through board training and the AICD."
3D,3D_244,A,"So I think those are – they’re nudges. They are quite good nudges. They get a lot more people. We used to get probably fewer females applying. Now there are lots of females applying, for example. A lot of medical practitioners are applying. So those nudges I think can be helpful. But in terms of quotas I think that’s like a sledgehammer approach. It may be necessary in the corporate arena, because it’s harder to nudge businesses that the government doesn’t have much control over."
3D,3D_245,Q,Which the government doesn’t have control over?
3D,3D_246,A,"Yes. It’s harder to provide those nudges. I don’t know what sort of incentives you could apply, but maybe there are some. A tax deduction, that’ll do it. That’ll do it."
3D,3D_247,Q2,"You talked about a resistance to change idea, but any other barriers – what are the other barriers or the main barriers, do you think, to increasing diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and social – that sort of stuff?"
3D,3D_248,A,"I think – there’s resistance to change, sure, with the clubbiness of certainly the corporate world. “You’re not in the right golf club, you didn’t go to the right school, university,” whatever. There’s a barrier, because you don’t know the people. There’s no network effect for you. You don’t know the people, right? I think there’s also a tension between trying to get more skills-based boards, and increasing the diversity. Sometimes it’s hard to do both, and so you run into – if you try to do this, you’ll run into arguments from the other side, and if you try to increase the skills base and they’re all men then you’re in trouble if you try to include the gender diversity."
3D,3D_249,A,"But I think that diversity of background is really missing, because we talk about gender diversity and we talk about skills-based boards, et cetera, but there’s I think a lot of people who don’t get a look-in just because of social background, whatever their educational attainments and professional attainments, just because they don’t know the right people or because they come from a particular ethnic group."
3D,3D_25,Q,"Okay. Yes, that’s good. Excellent. Okay, so do you think diversity of Australian boards is important?"
3D,3D_250,Q,So is there any way the government or your board can help with that?
3D,3D_251,Q2,"This is a more general question, so – it’s a more general -"
3D,3D_252,A,"I don’t know. I find it difficult to believe that in Australia at the moment that anything much would change, driven by the government, just because they’ve got their own problems. They see [silly] 01:01:46 between whatever they want to do all the time."
3D,3D_253,Q2,"It’s [more of] 01:01:47 issue for them, yes."
3D,3D_254,A,"Yes, but of course, having said that of course, the issue of women in the liberal party, and in parliament in general, is actually – if they would sort that out, maybe they would provide an example for the corporate world, maybe. But -"
3D,3D_255,Q,And the ABC.
3D,3D_256,Q2,"Would you feel differently about targets, as opposed to hard quotas?"
3D,3D_257,A,"Yes. I think targets as a good thing, and the AICD has had targets for a long time, and they’ve been quite successful, hitting pretty much their – what is it? 30 per cent? I think they’re pretty much hitting those now."
3D,3D_258,Q,"Why are they successful? How does that work, do you think?"
3D,3D_259,A,"It’s just been years of nudging and carrying on, I think."
3D,3D_26,A,Yes.
3D,3D_260,Q,"What is it, peer pressure?"
3D,3D_261,A,"No, it’s just noise."
3D,3D_262,Q,Just noise.
3D,3D_263,A,"I think so. Yes, it’s just noise. There’s been some sort of turnover and – as people have been dislodged, maybe, a little bit, from things. There’s been a woman as the chair of the AICD for a while now, but she just -"
3D,3D_264,Q2,"She’s just stepped down, in the past -"
3D,3D_265,A,"She’s stepped down, yes. She’s quite vocal about it as well. So that’s helped, I think. It’s made it seem acceptable from – she is part of big boards at the big end of town, and so she’s made it seem quite – an acceptable topic of conversation, I think, and that’s part of it. I think it’s modelling some behaviours. I think that’s probably – so targets; modelling behaviours – I think probably it’s slower, but maybe it will have a better effect in the end than quotas. Quotas might have a difficult effect, I think. Part of the problem is a couple of levels below that, because – okay, take one step back."
3D,3D_266,A,"Part of the problem is it’s the same sort of people who are appointed to Australian corporate boards – CEOs or ex-CEOs, lawyers and accountants. That’s whom you appoint. If you don’t have lots of senior women in those roles, you can’t appoint them, but you can get around that, A) by promoting more women to those senior roles, or you can start appointing different sorts of people to those boards who’ve had different sorts of experience. There are very few technology people on boards, even though that’s the subject of lots of conversations for boards. It’s about technology, about cyber-crime, about privacy issues, data, blah-blah. But there’s no technology people on boards. Nobody understands it."
3D,3D_267,Q,Even your 30-year-olds?
3D,3D_268,A,They’re all right.
3D,3D_269,Q2,It’s a lot more complex than that.
3D,3D_27,Q,Why?
3D,3D_270,Q,Yes. Right.
3D,3D_271,A,"But you see what I mean. You can appoint different sorts of people to the board, and/or you can promote more people to that sort of – for CEO and next level down positions."
3D,3D_272,Q,And it will all work out -
3D,3D_273,A,And to – so there are people to filter up then.
3D,3D_274,Q,"Yes. So it would upstream – build downstream rather, to come up."
3D,3D_275,Q2,I think we’ve covered the -
3D,3D_276,Q,We’ve done it all.
3D,3D_277,Q2,"Yes, it’s just the final -"
3D,3D_278,Q,"Yes, so the final thing. Thank you very much. If you have any other thoughts on board diversity and how it should be managed, that would be great. Otherwise we’re finished."
3D,3D_279,A,"No. Not really. The only thing I’d say is that depending who you’re talking to, cognitive diversity is a big topic in academia, but maybe not so much in the corporate world, maybe."
3D,3D_28,A,"It is, for the diversity of thinking that that brings, in board deliberations. But also just not in the actual deliberation, but in maybe the attitudes or determining what’s important to make a deliberation upon, and the way you go about that, I think. Yes."
3D,3D_280,Q,Is there another word for it?
3D,3D_281,Q2,We’ve got it the other way actually.
3D,3D_282,A,Have you?
3D,3D_283,Q2,"You talk to [Jeff Sozena] 01:05:37, for example – I can assure you, in the academic thing the big issue is around the gender and that sort of stuff, right? Because, to be honest, let’s call it skills diversity – that’s always been there – but the matrixes are there, of the AICD, because they’ve got the templates, et cetera. I think that’s so understood, and it is [unclear] 01:06:10."
3D,3D_284,A,"Sort of, but I don’t think it’s acted on. There are a lot of people with the same – it’s not just skills, but it’s also – it’s background."
3D,3D_285,Q2,"No, no, sorry, I’m not talking about – we’re interested in that sort of diversity primarily, in this study. I’m not talking about those issues. Agreed. That’s off. Right? That’s not happening. There’s no dispute there. What I’m essentially saying – the interview is over -"
3D,3D_286,A,You can turn it off?
3D,3D_287,Q,Will I turn it off?
3D,3D_288,Q2,"No, I’m not going to say anything too outrageous – what I’m trying to say is that we need at least one accountant, one lawyer, one clinician, if it’s a hospital, or one marketer if it’s a real [unclear] 01:06:57 or whatever. That sort of thing is well established. There are matrixes for that, et cetera. I think the response we get from a lot of corporates when you just say, “Gender diversity,” or, “Diversity,” they say, “Well, all that is nice. What’s really, really important is this cognitive diversity,” i.e., the sort of thing I’m describing. They arrive in their role and that’s -"
3D,3D_289,A,"Yes, I think sometimes that’s a -"
3D,3D_29,Q2,"Can I just – a quick follow up on that – you talked about skills diversity, and clearly that will bring a diversity of thinking. But do you feel that some of the other markers of diversity, which newspapers love – gender being the big one – but possibly cultural, ethnic, socioeconomic, age – do you think that that does the same?"
3D,3D_290,Q,-@ excuse?
3D,3D_291,A,"Yes. It’s about making – everybody’s diverse – if you cast everybody as diverse, it has a different effect than saying there’s a group here or a group there. It’s, “Everybody as an individual is diverse,” which is true, and that’s what I was saying – there’s an intersection of all these different things. But sometimes it’s a bit of an excuse to say, “Well, we -”"
3D,3D_292,Q2,"No, but it’s complex because, for example, if – we’re now just straying away, but if for example we said, “Why is gender important?” because the sight theory, which essentially talks about, as an average, men thinking differently from women, et cetera – however, if you had this marvellously gender diverse board, which was five and five, and you have five Margaret Thatchers sitting on the board, well, I’m not sure."
3D,3D_293,A,"They’d kill each other, those board people."
3D,3D_294,Q2,"No, but I’m not sure that that is real diversity."
3D,3D_295,A,"No, it’s not. That’s what I was saying."
3D,3D_296,Q2,"She was a product of her time. She was a – her – from everything you could see, she had a very male orientation, in a lot of what she did."
3D,3D_297,A,"But also I think if you – again, if you only appoint CEOs or former CEOs to the board, those people have had to fight their way up that ladder to get there. They’re going to be very similar in a lot of ways. You don’t get to be the CEO of a large company without being aggressive, to some extent, without being willing to do the dirty deeds that you need to get done. So I think – yes, it’s more than that. You have to – but -"
3D,3D_298,Q2,"I think the point you made earlier about the overlapping sets, the intersections being important, I think is a good one. Because yes, if you’ve got two females who’ve – or a male and a female who’ve gone to Scotch and PLC, similar backgrounds, Melbourne Law School, did their four years with [unclear] 01:09:47 -"
3D,3D_299,A,Not that one.
3D,3D_3,Q,"Okay, perfect. Okay, so there’s a lot of talk about board diversity, but we’re interested to hear from people like you who are actually sitting on boards. Let’s start by hearing about what you understand board diversity to mean."
3D,3D_30,A,"Yes, it does, and that’s why I’m – that’s why I think some of the current conversations around gender diversity are not particularly useful, because – I’m just going to pick an example. If you pick two women who have been to school at PLC Melbourne to replace two men who’ve been to Scotch at Melbourne, and have also all gone to Melbourne Law School, then the diversity of thought is not necessarily there. You’ve flipped genders, but – the point of it – there’s two points to diversity, I think. One is that it brings diversity of thought and approaches, et cetera. But also, to some extent, you want to have some reflection of your community for an organisation such as this one, because you’re there to serve the community."
3D,3D_300,Q2,That’s a [unclear] 01:09:52 - like [Glad news] 01:09:54 or – [no news] 01:09:55 is better. Then you’re going to end up with a very similar beast at the end of it.
3D,3D_301,A,"I think so, yes."
3D,3D_302,Q,"Hold on, can I just clarify – what’s come to me with this interview, you’ve got cognitive diversity here, then you’ve got all this demographic diversity. Now, you said, “Well, you can’t – gender alone is not going to cut it, but if you have gender and you have social background, and CEO experience, [or not a word about] 01:10:26 then that’s where you start to get cognitive diversity.” So you can say, “Yes, this will be – this person will think different -”"
3D,3D_303,A,"You can’t predict it, I don’t think."
3D,3D_304,Q,“- to another person who’s got a different group of demographic.”
3D,3D_305,A,Maybe.
3D,3D_306,Q2,"I’m not sure that’s what [the participant]  said, because by and large, when cognitive diversity – weren’t you talking about skills plus a style of thinking?"
3D,3D_307,A,"All of the above. That was actually my original question when I said about academic and business, is – the point I was going to make was maybe you need to define what you mean by cognitive diversity, as opposed to other – because I’m going on – I’m pretty much – I think I started off talking about skills and experiences and yada yada, but it’s also those other things as well. And so because your socioeconomic background, religious background, ethnic background, all plays into the way you think about things, to quite fundamental levels. If you have a same-sex partner, for example, you might be thinking about those sort of discussions in a very different way to not, no matter whether you’re an accountant or a lawyer or whatever."
3D,3D_308,A,"So I think you – yes. So to me there’s a bit of – what’s the definition? To me, cognitive diversity is thinking – a diversity of the way you think. But then again you can bring that down to, is everybody’s – none of the three of us think the same way about probably a lot of things, and so – I think it’s more – what’s the word I’m trying to find. It’s much more fuzzy, I think, than just “it’s either that or that”. I think it’s a bit of – there are probabilities and overlaps and fuzziness. So if we were both accountants we probably will think about some things in a similar way, but if I grew up in Tanzania and you grew up in Sweden then we’d probably think about other things in different ways. But yes -"
3D,3D_309,Q,[unclear] 01:12:45.
3D,3D_31,A,"So if they don’t see some sort of reflection of their own community – now, it turns out that the [Macedon Ranges] community is 90-something per cent Caucasian, so that’s what makes up the board too. We have no ethnic diversity -"
3D,3D_310,A,So I think it’s just not that -
3D,3D_311,Q,-@ compartmentalised.
3D,3D_312,A,"But I think both things are important for a board – people that can bring something in terms of the discussion, and that comes from cognitive diversity. Whether that’s engendered by your gender or your experiences or whatever – but also it is – a board is the, along with the CEOs, the big shiny thing on top of the building, right? It’s like this is what everybody sees and says, “Hey, look at these people. This is the top of the tree.” So to some extent you want them to be reflective of whatever community it is – whether that’s people that work there, or the wider community, or whatever, or the professions, whatever – but also to set some sort of an example."
3D,3D_313,A,"Because if the board is – and that’s one of the things, for example, I set students in the class, is – we were talking about diversity issues, and gender diversity and age diversity – but one of the conditions that I set is that the board is currently all male, all over 60, right? So nearly all the students say, “Well, the first thing you have to do is the board has to think about itself. How can you be telling everybody else that they should be hiring this way or doing this without eating your own dog food?” – as the Americans like to say. Yes."
3D,3D_314,Q,Okay. Thank you very much.
3D,3D_32,Q,-@ in the community.
3D,3D_33,A,"On the board. There’s not much in the community. I mean, about as exotic as it gets is people from Scandinavia. That’s about – there’s a few – maybe five per cent of people are from elsewhere, but a lot of them are Australian-born, and those who aren’t Australian-born are English, New Zealand – yes – and Northern Europe, yes."
3D,3D_34,Q,"So do you think if the community was more diverse, like perhaps a hospital network in Sunshine, for example, would the government be looking for more cultural diversity in that situation?"
3D,3D_35,A,"I’m not sure. I’m not sure what the government is looking for at any particular time. It changes – when you change minister – we have just changed minister, so I’m not sure what the new minister is looking for. But I believe she was, at some stage, minister for multiculturalism, so who knows? But I personally believe that’s a good idea then, to be a little bit more reflective of your community. So you should be there to serve the community, but also be of the community, to some extent. I think that’s helpful with engaging with the community when people who have the ultimate signing authority for things kind of look like at least some of them – look like the community."
3D,3D_36,Q,Do you think that’s particularly important because it’s health? Would it be the same if it was selling – if it was tyres?
3D,3D_37,A,"Yes. I think it is particularly important because it’s health, because it’s a service to the community. It’s very much a part of the community. Certainly up our way there would be a huge human cry if you started trying to close down the hospital, just because it’s part of the community. It’s part of the community identity that there is such a thing, and it’s been there –it’s the second oldest public hospital in Victoria, in fact, after Melbourne, I think. So yes. I think in the commercial context, often that reflection of your customer base is a little bit – it’s a bit tokenistic sometimes, rather than being real. Yes. But I do think it’s more important in something like health than selling tyres, yes."
3D,3D_38,Q,"Do you think it might be important if you were – you’re in public health, but let’s say you were in private health and exporting services, say, overseas. Do you think you would want your board to reflect your potential -"
3D,3D_39,A,-@ overseas client?
3D,3D_4,A,"Okay. I’ll give you a couple of different takes on it, maybe. In terms of the board that I sit on, we have requirements for diversity, because it’s a state-owned entity. Other than that, a lot of the chatter around board diversity is around increasing gender parity on boards, and not quite as much on other dimensions of diversity. That’s probably where most of the conversation comes in, for me, and with perhaps the exception of youth – a bit of diversity in terms of age range, because boards tend to be over 60, generally. Yes."
3D,3D_40,Q,Yes.
3D,3D_41,A,"Not necessarily. I think you’d need to have people who understood that market, but part of the reason that people would be coming to buy those services is because it’s of the local expertise side of thing. You have to be careful not to dilute that. Maybe to some extent, but yes."
3D,3D_42,Q,"Okay, so expertise is another really important thing on your board, to preserve that, and that’s technical as well, is it? Or just your financial, legal -?"
3D,3D_43,A,"Well, definitely the financial, because life in a public health authority is always driven by the dollars that are available. But no, we have clinical expertise and we have legal expertise and we have other – and also board expertise is actually – is quite sought-after."
3D,3D_44,Q,What does that look like?
3D,3D_45,A,"Just people who have had experience on boards, or as senior executives. That’s one of the criteria that we look at, is that success in professional life, outside of this. These used to be voluntary positions. They’re now paid, on a sessional basis, but you’re not going to – you’re not going to buy yourself a new Mercedes from it. So when it was voluntary, that was definitely the case, that you’ve got something to offer. But board expertise or senior executive expertise was always sought-after."
3D,3D_46,Q,"Okay, so do you cultivate that expertise in your community by some way, to people within your community?"
3D,3D_47,A,"Not as much as we should probably. There’s been talk about it, but no more than talk, I think. We have gone a little ways in terms of inviting external people onto the committees of the board to sit as external members of us. So for example we have a local accountant on the audit and risk committee, and we have a consumer and – what’s it called? Something consumer advisory committee, and there are lots of external people that sit on that from the community. So that’s the way we, at some stage, the last time we had that conversation, have decided to approach that – it’s by bringing people into committees and giving them some experience on how does a board committee work, and then that’s the way of giving them some board experience."
3D,3D_48,A,"Mind you, we have people on that consumer advisory committee who have had long – who are retired, and have had very long experience themselves as chairs of boards of various sorts – community organisations up to fairly large commercial concerns. They come back when they want to contribute something. Members of parliament – they usually get a gong when those – they have one. We only have one of those."
3D,3D_49,Q,Okay. So they get on your boards and -
3D,3D_5,Q,"Okay, so you say it’s a state-run one, so what proportion of your board would be female?"
3D,3D_50,A,"The larger public hospital boards tend to get many more political appointments, because they’re more in the public eye, so the Royal Melbourne and even Bendigo Hospital has one or two – it might even be two ex-health ministers on them, [unclear] 00:14:53."
3D,3D_51,Q,"Okay, so would there be political diversity between them? Like one’s from labour, one’s from -?"
3D,3D_52,A,"Yes, it depends who’s in power at the time, yes, at the time of appointment. Yes. The person who was – he was a member of the Victorian Upper House, he was deputy speaker I think, at one stage, and was on our board. He’s been there – he was appointed by a liberal health minister and has been reappointed by labour health ministers. I don’t know if there’s too much of that going on, I don’t think."
3D,3D_53,Q,Okay. Does the network they bring benefit the board?
3D,3D_54,A,Yes.
3D,3D_55,Q,How? Can you tell me?
3D,3D_56,A,"Of parliamentarians, do you mean?"
3D,3D_57,Q,Yes. How does that work?
3D,3D_58,A,"Because it’s the way that government works seems to be quite different to the way the rest of the world works. So those with parliamentary experience certainly – and definitely have had government experience – it’s kind of a – they seem to understand how things will work. We’ve got merger talks that we’ve put off now because of the state election that was, for example, and it was like, “What do you think?” But they also have networks and so we’ve spoken to – we’ve spoke to the current member of parliament for the region, as well as the opposition candidate, and a member of parliament from the other party, from a neighbouring region, et cetera, because of those networks. Yes."
3D,3D_59,Q,"Okay, so they understand the culture, they understand the rules -?"
3D,3D_6,A,"We have – at the moment we have 12 board members, of whom seven are female, and five male. It was the other way around – it was five and seven, and then it went to six and six, and this last round has been – so it’s -"
3D,3D_60,A,"What’s likely to fly and what’s likely not to fly, and how would you couch it in order that it should fly. So there’s two different parts to that. One is how would it fly with the department. So we’ve got people with health department experience, and also how would it fly in the ministerial world."
3D,3D_61,Q,"Yes. Well, that’s very important for a public hospital. It’s very strategic."
3D,3D_62,Q2,"Just getting back to board diversity issues, we’ve talked a bit about positive impacts, in [terms of] 00:16:55 diversity on [clinician] 00:15:59 performance, et cetera. Do you feel that board diversity can negatively impact performance?"
3D,3D_63,A,"Yes, sure it can."
3D,3D_64,Q,And how might this happen? Can you give me an example?
3D,3D_65,A,"It can happen when the diversity is predicated, for example, on the political side, but also really deeply held beliefs. The most robust conversation we’ve had so far as a board – I’m assuming this is all confidential, by the way?"
3D,3D_66,Q,Yes. Yes.
3D,3D_67,A,"It’s around the same sex marriage bill, and should the hospital, as an entity, say anything? Say nothing? If so, what? Because it was felt that it was a public health issue for mental health reasons, for example, that we should maybe say something. But that was probably the longest and most contentious debate the board has had. There were views that were quite polar opposites. So that’s okay if you are able to work to a consensus view. If you work to a consensus view and neither that side nor that side is happy with it, maybe that’s not so useful, because the board has to speak as one. So, that’s where diversity can get in the way, I guess, if you like, on the more deeply felt, deeply held issues."
3D,3D_68,A,"I think there’s also – it can lead to process conflict, where people are deciding how to go about something. I think I’ve found that mostly with age differences – of how you should go about things, or direct action, or perhaps a little bit more sit back and not do so much and let things take their course. It can get in the way, but as I said, I think there’s probably been one occasion where it’s gotten to a quite heated, robust conversation. But our chair is pretty good at controlling those."
3D,3D_69,Q,How does the chair manage that sort of conflict?
3D,3D_7,Q2,And the requirements for diversity is entirely round gender?
3D,3D_70,A,"Well, it’s a very well behaved board in the first place. It’s not very formal, at times, but quite well behaved. People listen to each other, and I think because it was that sort of background it was easier for the chair to say, “Okay, we’ve heard that now. We’re going to move onto the next person,” or, “We’ve talked this one to death. Let’s do something else.” So there’s a couple of ways, in terms of the content of things, or the way you go about things, then diversity can be problematic. I think the other way too is where there is a diversity of one. So if there’s one person who’s not of one type – so I think then what happens is that person will either constantly be at odds with everybody else, or they’ll just shut down and won’t say anything. They just won’t speak up, because maybe they think that they’re just going to get overruled anyway, so what’s the point?"
3D,3D_71,Q,"That’s a really good – that one comes out in a process question. We’ll go to that and then go back, I think. Here: can you think of any ways that boards can help directors from minority groups to feel part of the board and to feel free to fully participate in decision-making?"
3D,3D_72,A,"Yes, I think you need at least two people. If you have an all-male board and you appoint one woman you’re probably not going to get as much out of that appointment as if you’d appointed two. I think."
3D,3D_73,Q,"But if we’re talking about – back to the marriage one – if you’re talking about, say, sexual identity, if you think of the very different – many ways that we can have diversity: gender; age; socioeconomic; cultural; sexual orientation – if we have two of everything, you’re going to have a very big [ship] 00:21:29."
3D,3D_74,A,"No, no, I’m not saying you have to have two of everything, but you shouldn’t have isolates, I think. That’s what I’m saying. If you are deliberately trying to make your board more diverse then a token appointment of one may be -"
3D,3D_75,Q,"And have everyone else the same, you mean?"
3D,3D_76,A,"The other thing too – and look, I’m speaking from maybe some other knowledge as well as being on the board – but when you start getting coalitions going, it can be really problematic. You can see that, even on our board, which as I said is a very, very well behaved board. But you can see coalitions forming around certain things. When there’s more than one – where they form around more than one characteristic – so let’s say if it’s around younger – if there’s younger and female, you can see – it’s a much stronger coalition than if it was just females or just younger, and a male/female mix. As it happens, both of the younger members are in fact female, and so you do see a bit of that coalition forming."
3D,3D_77,Q,"Yes, so do you see that as a problem?"
3D,3D_78,A,"It’s only a problem if it’s unchecked, I think. If it becomes – it can become a problem, I’m sure, but it isn’t a problem at the moment. As I said, the chair is pretty good at making sure everybody is heard. That includes, in our case, we have – our CEO is not a member of the board. They report to the board. We have a CEO and a deputy CEO, and usually the director of corporate services sitting at the board meetings. So they’re included. So when we ask people’s opinions, their opinions are included as well. The decision is the board’s to make, but they’re not excluded from the conversation. We do have executive sessions, or in-camera sessions at the end, where there’s no staff present, but – yes, I think the chair is pretty good at managing that and making sure everybody’s heard."
3D,3D_79,Q,"Yes. So when – to come to a decision then where there’s been – there’s lots of different views, does it have to be a consensus? Is it voted – how does the chair manage the resolution?"
3D,3D_8,A,"Correct. The formal requirements for diversity is around gender parity – achieving gender parity, to the extent that when we interview for new board members, the candidates that we put to the minister must be equal numbers male and female."
3D,3D_80,A,"It’s usually consensus. Usually we come to a consensus view. If it looks like it’s coming to a vote we usually see if there’s any way of recasting that so there’s something that everybody could buy into, rather than – I don’t think there’s been a point yet where it’s come to a vote and stayed that way."
3D,3D_81,Q,"Okay, so that would be seen as a bit of a failure, as a risk, on something?"
3D,3D_82,A,"I don’t know if it would be seen as a failure. It would certainly be very unusual and make people think as to why this has happened, because yes, it’s unusual enough."
3D,3D_83,Q,"Okay, so the marriage one, what happened there? What was the outcome?"
3D,3D_84,A,"We came to a – yes, we came to a consensus decision about what the – that we would just stick to the medical facts and that there are other agencies who are more skilled at this, and we’ve taken – the local community health organisation for example put out quite a strong statement, as did the [Baker – it wasn’t the Baker institute] 00:25:05 – it was one of those institutes that’s out there at the Alfred there anyway. But they put together quite a strong statement, and we took pieces from that and said, “Look, medically, blah-blah, this is a concern, and by the way if you are concerned, here are some numbers to call, but this is our take on it, that we just want people to interact respectfully about this.”"
3D,3D_85,Q,"And use those resources. Yes. Great. That’s good, so now we’ll move onto process. How does diversity influence your board’s functioning? You’ve described a little bit there about conflict. Do you think that the different kinds of diversity, like gender, might influence things differently to age, differently to social background, differently to ethnicity? Like -?"
3D,3D_86,A,In terms of process?
3D,3D_87,Q,"In terms of board process, yes. The board’s functioning."
3D,3D_88,A,"I think it does. I think different sorts of people have different preferences in terms of discussions and deliberations. So that makes – I think that makes a difference. If you get a group of 50-year-old, or 60-year old men, of which I’m part of that group, together, there are a lot of statements. So I think female board members tend to maybe ask more questions that aren’t quite as pointed – more open-ended questions maybe that aren’t as, “What is the answer to this?” It’s more of a, “What could we do?” or, “Is there a way of -?” something. So I think that makes a difference. I’m sure there are cultural differences too, but as I said, ours is not a very multicultural board."
3D,3D_89,Q,"Yes, and the age difference -"
3D,3D_9,Q,Okay. Do they make the final choice?
3D,3D_90,A,"I think age – yes, it does. I think the younger members of our board are definitely more gung-ho about things, maybe. They’re not quite as maybe measured sometimes, as some of the older ones, who’ve -"
3D,3D_91,Q,"How does that work in the group, say for strategy or something?"
3D,3D_92,A,"I think it balances itself out. Where we’ve had – we have – annual, at least, but they’ve been actually more often, because we’ve been having these talks about the merger, et cetera – strategy away days, et cetera – they’ve been facilitated quite well. I think that’s been important. Again, staff have been included, so executive staff have been included in those, and so the conversations get a bit broader and you’re mixed up, and so there’s – the facilitation, I think, makes a big difference to that sort of thing, for those strategic kind of conversations."
3D,3D_93,Q,"Can you – this facilitation idea is so key to what you’ve talked about with conflict, and now with strategy. Can you unpack that a little for us?"
3D,3D_94,A,"Well, in terms of the board, obviously, but the chair – that’s one of the – a good chair, in my opinion, anyway, should be a facilitator as much as anything. They should aim to get the most out of all, and maybe a little less from some, and maybe a little bit more from others. That’s one of their key roles, I think, is to shape the conversation but also to make sure that everybody has had a chance to have their say. In a strategy day context, that looks a lot different, but it’s about, again, making sure that there’s no people dominating. There’s no – whether that’s the chair or the CEO or whoever else dominating."
3D,3D_95,A,"We have a couple of quite strongly opinionated board members, but – so that nobody dominates. So you have to do that by blending things in the right way. So I think facilitation is key to all of that, and certainly at the board level as well, you have to – At the committee level – the board committee level, there’s not as much of that that goes on, and so the conversations are maybe a little bit more one-sided, or a little blunter, maybe, sometimes."
3D,3D_96,Q2,"So things like your strategy or whatever, presumably there’s some element of some external facilitation?"
3D,3D_97,A,Correct.
3D,3D_98,Q2,"Yes, so that kind of helps."
3D,3D_99,A,"Yes. So whether it’s – I think last time – who was it last time? PWC or somebody, yes. Yes, absolutely. Having a neutral third part, I think, is -"
40D,40D_1,Q,"Okay Participant 40D, thank you so much for agreeing to participate in the research on diversity of Australian boards. As you're aware, there's quite a bit of research in the area. But what we're particularly interested in is the Australian perspective. We're interviewing Australian directors of companies and organisations that influence Australian boards. We're gathering data from the field and we're working from the ground up to develop a model to understand how diversity is understood here and how it's managed. So that's basically it."
40D,40D_10,A,"Yeah. Then once I went overseas in 2006 - so then there was some foreign boards as well. There was, again, I suppose you'd probably call it a listed investment company that was NYSE - so New York Stock Exchange listed that I was on for a number of years called Invesco Mortgage Capital. I was on a number of - and chair of a lot of different Invesco what you'd think of was really internal boards rather than external boards. But then, towards the end, I was actually chairman of - I should have got them to take that - can I steal your -"
40D,40D_100,A,"In fact, it goes all the way back to what I was saying before. That the boards, in fact, are typically going to be trying to appoint people that are like them. So they're not truly looking for - I don't think they're actually looking for true diversity."
40D,40D_101,Q,What do you think holds boards in that pattern of not looking for diversity as you've defined it?
40D,40D_102,A,"It goes back to your comfort zone; that you're going to feel more comfortable if you've got people around the table that are like you. We tend to group ourselves together with people who are like minded and who think like us. We only have to see the extreme nonsense that's, unfortunately, been the consequence of the internet - with the way that we've all gotten our little tribes and stuff - that people feel comfortable in that. So that's always going to be the way. That’s your natural inclination is to be - is to have people around you that are like you. And if you're an executive and you're hiring people, you've got to always work hard to push back against your natural inclination, which is to employ someone like you."
40D,40D_103,Q,That's right. Is it an unconscious bias or a conscious bias?
40D,40D_104,A,"That's what I think. I think it's a really strong unconscious bias. Then partially, it's going to be conscious as well. So to actually force yourself out of your comfort zone and to go to - to get people who are truly different is actually not easy to achieve. Then you go to the boards - and you get to the point of knowing the board, to be effective, they're probably going to have to work well together, etcetera. So as soon as you've - and I've certainly seen people who come onto boards and don't work effectively."
40D,40D_105,Q,Is that because of diversity?
40D,40D_106,A,"Interestingly, it's less about that, honestly, than oftentimes, these are people who don't understand how a board dynamic works. In other words - and are not, therefore, able to figure out how to influence outcomes and decisions the way they would like. In other words -"
40D,40D_107,Q,So what's the board dynamic that people have to learn to work with?
40D,40D_108,A,"Well you have to learn that - a lot of people struggle - it's very hard for a lot of people to make the transition from management and exec - particularly being CEO - to a board. Because if you're the executive, you've been used to - if you're a bad manager, which a lot of them are - of being - just telling people what to do. [Laugh][overtalking] 00:31:28 -"
40D,40D_109,Q,[Overtalking] 00:31:28
40D,40D_11,Q,"This? Yeah, sure."
40D,40D_110,A,What I call the old school command and control type manager. And all joking aside; you would see a lot of them in academia.
40D,40D_111,Q,Oh definitely. Definitely.
40D,40D_112,A,"You've got a lot - no disrespect, but a lot of academics have very high IQ; they have zero EQ."
40D,40D_113,Q,It's very hierarchical.
40D,40D_114,A,"Sorry, that's a bit harsh. But you know what I mean. So it's the people with the low EQ skills that are the ones that are really going to struggle around the board table. Because they come around - they're not understanding how the board dynamic works. They're not understanding that, just because - they may think they're the smartest person around the table - which is always sad when you have people like that. But they may think they're very smart. They may think they're most knowledgeable on a particular topic so, therefore, people should just do what they're saying. It's like, well that's fine, but that's not the way it works."
40D,40D_115,A,"You've got to understand that dynamic; ie. Who are the different people around the table? What is the - what are the things that influence them? In other words, you've got to have - to be effective - so we go back to my comment about you've got to understand the industry, be knowledgeable about it and the company's business model, etcetera. But if you're going to be an effective board member, you then next need to have good EQ skills so that you know how to get your view across."
40D,40D_116,Q,"Let's say the organisation that you're working in - your board of - like you're at the board - is a very hierarchical organisation. Should the board dynamics reflect that of the organisation or - Do you know what I mean? Let's say it's a very old fashioned, command and control model in the organisation and the board is trying to do - work the model that you're talking about where people are engaging more as a team - in that dynamic. Is that a mismatch between the two? Will that board try and transform the organisation? Is there any connection between these - the tone of the two levels of the organisation?"
40D,40D_117,A,"Yeah, good point. I'd go backwards and say that the board's primary task is to do its job well and to be as effective as it can be. So if it makes a decision that the way to do it is to act in - it's pretty hard to be command and control around a board table. But I've seen chairs try to do that. The ones that are - you can imagine being on a board with Donald Trump as your chair; it would be a nightmare. So what happens in that sort of scenario is the people who may want to be expressing a different opinion - if you have a really dominating chair, they're just going to leave. They'll just leave. So you end up - you can end up with it -"
40D,40D_118,A,"Is that good for the organisation? I'd say absolutely not. Because you're not going to have - that means you don't have an effective board because you've got it dominated by an individual or two. That's certainly not going to help an organisation which may already, if you've described it correctly, is controlled that way. So that's going to be pretty close to a lose-lose, I would have thought."
40D,40D_119,Q,Is there anything in Australia in the context that would prevent that happening? I presume you haven't actually seen it here in Australia.
40D,40D_12,A,"Was chairman of what we called Invesco UK, I suppose it would have been, or Invesco Perpetual. This was the ultimate entity of the UK organisation that had two external directors. It was the entity that the local regulators and so on wanted to be the primary board for the UK in particular, but also the - well the UK more than the European. Because post the financial crisis, the regulators, globally, got very hung up about reporting lines and independence of local groups vis-à-vis parents."
40D,40D_120,A,I'm sure there's boards out there that are like that. I haven't [overtalking] 00:34:53.
40D,40D_121,Q,You haven't [overtalking] 00:34:53. So there's nothing in the regulatory environment or in our cultural environment that would prevent that kind of tyranny at a board level.
40D,40D_122,A,"Tyranny. I think Australians, we pride ourselves on being independent and all that sort of stuff. We're not quite as far out of the spectrum as the Texans are, but we think we are. That would help a little bit. But experience tells me that the tone from the top - and we're now getting into cultural issues rather than diversity issues, which I think are -"
40D,40D_123,Q,Is it different? Because [overtalking] 00:35:33 -
40D,40D_124,A,"No, I don't know that they are. Because the culture -"
40D,40D_125,Q,- background was part of -
40D,40D_126,A,"Yeah, culture - I think board culture and organisation culture's absolutely critical. One of the pre-conditions from having a decent organisational culture is that you've got the right way in which people - so you don't have this - the tone is set from the top. Maybe put it in positives rather than negatives. The tone is absolutely set from the top. So if you've got the tone from the top which is a command and control; that is going to - that will - to greater or lesser degrees, will run through the board and has the potential to run through the organisation. I don't think - it's not one for one. The board cannot - you know, can I have a different way of operating relative to the organisation and vice versa. But the tone from the top in the management team will be set absolutely by the CEO. And that man or woman has a staggering amount of control, frankly, over what the organisation's going to look like culturally."
40D,40D_127,Q,But the chair - the board can sack the CEO if they're not happy. So there's that link.
40D,40D_128,A,"Sure. Sure. So that gets then to - precisely. So if you get - and this is something that's problematic for boards is getting to the point where you've got a - if you have a CEO - just a simple example. [Inaudible] 00:37:00 you've got a CEO who's delivering good business results - and by that, I'll define it as good results for shareholders, for staff and for clients or customers. So imagine that the weird world that they're doing all three and actually thinking about all three. You can imagine someone who's doing that, but is not doing it in a way that the board thinks is well aligned culturally with the sort of organisation they'd like to have. Where you've got someone who's delivering results but failing on the cultural side; they find it really hard to make the decision that they have to, which is, “You know what? We haven't got the right person.” They find that really hard"
40D,40D_129,Q,"Yeah, yeah. That would be hard."
40D,40D_13,A,"Because I don't know if you remember with - the big issue was Lehman Brothers went broke. When Lehman Brothers went broke, basically what - sorry, what they ended up doing was they shunted a lot of money out of their UK and European subsidiaries back to the US to try and support the US business. So that meant that when the thing went belly up, it was not just the parent and the US entities, but also the UK and European ones went because they'd basically funnelled all the money out of them. So the regulators then became paranoid about the independence of local boards."
40D,40D_130,A,"And ditto within a board context. It gets really hard that, if you have someone who's behaving around the table in a way that's not culturally aligned with the way the board would like to behave, the same thing applies. It's oftentimes that - that's one thing I've noticed. It's really - boards find it really difficult to have the - so it falls to the chair - for the chair to talk to the board member and say, look, that behaviour is just not acceptable. We don't expect to see that anymore around the table. Or more to the point, to get to the point ultimately of saying, you know what, Fred? You're really not behaving - you're not being the sort of contributor that we need. You really should not - we're not going to support you standing at the next re-election or you should stand down or something. To have that tough conversation is - it doesn't often happen."
40D,40D_131,Q,Yet that kind of conversation seems to me would be essential in - to ensure inclusivity -
40D,40D_132,A,Absolutely.
40D,40D_133,Q,Because it's the soft stuff - the EQ you're really talking about. Because they're doing the task well -
40D,40D_134,A,"Yeah, yeah. Because if you've got these strong people around the table, it means that people who may have a - will feel threatened - they'll feel - threatened too strong. They'll find it hard to speak up. You've got to have an environment which is - the chair in particular has got to create an environment where the members of the board feel safe to - feel it's safe to speak up."
40D,40D_135,Q,Thank you for that. Can you give me an example of how diversity of thought or perspective influences board functioning? Like how it's - can you give me an example - an Australian context one?
40D,40D_136,A,"I hadn't thought about that one. [Long pause] okay, so one that's maybe close to home is that we've been thinking, in A superannuation fund, about what the default [long pause] fund should be. You know, should it be this defined benefit or a different one? I think it's fair to say that if it was only the views of people like myself and Ian, who've got a very strong, pure investment background, we would have gone pretty strongly down one track. But it was the views of some of the others and, in particular, some of the academics and the people representing the academic staff, and the university and the unions and whatever – say, well, yeah, look, we hear that, but you're not really putting enough of a premium on this risk and the - what we'd call an uncertainty premium in our [minds] 00:40:31."
40D,40D_137,A,"In other words, the big advantage of the defined benefit is that it's giving the people who've got it some certainty as to what their retirement income looks like. So what I'm saying is that for those of us who are the pure investment people, we'd go down the track of saying, the optimal investment outcomes is probably going to actually be - if we did - and we have done. We've done [Monte Carlo] 00:40:51 simulations, running out 20, 30 - you know, done all that sort of stuff that you do and you've got your -"
40D,40D_138,Q,Yeah. [Overtalking] 00:40:56 -
40D,40D_139,A,"Then it's like, see, this is going to be on net-net, on average, on balance, majority of people are going to be better off with this than that. And it's like, well yeah, we hear that, but. So that's an example where people with a different frame of reference and a different perspective - we're going to therefore lead to the board to come to a conclusion which maybe you wouldn't have thought of to start with."
40D,40D_14,A,"I've been typically on the industry associations where - I was on the industry funds management industry association here in Australia. Again, that would have been back in the '90s - later part of the '90s. And was on the equivalent - not in the US, because they didn't really have one. But was on the equivalent in the UK in those last years. So that would have been '15 - '14, '15, '16 type timeframe. I didn't bring my CV, but there was quite a - there were some others as well."
40D,40D_140,Q,"That's a really good example. Thank you. And it works really well with the definition of how you understand diversity, which is great. [Long pause] the example you gave - have you experienced or - have you experienced conflict - because of these different perspectives, conflict -"
40D,40D_141,A,"Absolutely. Absolutely. This is where the chair plays a key role to manage this. Because you absolutely have conflict because, hopefully, you've got people who are quite passionate about what they're doing, so they are going to have sometimes strongly held views on this. So it can be quite the challenge for the chair - and hopefully supported by other members of the board - to say everybody's got to have their turn. Everybody's got to be able to say their piece and try and have those views listened to. And try and - and the role of the chair is, to me, to - particularly for people who might not be experts in the field. If they're trying to express a view - to help them express it in a way that is understood by the experts - in a way that's helpful for changing or influencing opinion - because for the non-experts, it can sometimes be pretty easy to belittle them or to knock them down."
40D,40D_142,Q,That's a really good point. Yes. Yeah.
40D,40D_143,A,"So unless you've got - so the role of the chair, therefore, falls to not letting - just because someone's not able to actually present their case really strongly, therefore the case has got to be dismissed - but [in a way] 00:43:06, just about to do the opposite - to say, okay, what's the point they're trying to make here? How can we try and look at this in our context? So it's one of the arts of good chairs, which you honestly don't see very often [laugh]. Honestly. But a good chair will do that. In other words, they won't simply seek the views of the people around the table, but they will try and get them out on the table in a way that they are actually being properly expressed, if that makes sense."
40D,40D_144,Q,"It makes a lot of sense. Because it's like a negotiation tool. Part of conflict can be just a misunderstanding. I could understand that, if someone's from very much a financial background and someone's very much HR; there's room for just complete misunderstanding."
40D,40D_145,A,Absolutely. Absolutely.
40D,40D_146,Q,So the chair translates -
40D,40D_147,A,"And if you're in a business like ours, or an industry like ours - finance - I mean, the finance people are always going to have the upper hand. This is why you've got to -"
40D,40D_148,Q,"Exactly. It's a really good example. Could you bold that, transcriber, please? That's good. Thanks. Now we're talking about selection of new members. You've already alluded to, in broad terms, how it's done. Can you - have you observed - probably maybe in the past, but definitely recently, how - how were you recruited onto - how did you find your way onto A superannuation fund?"
40D,40D_149,A,[Laugh] exactly the same as all of these.
40D,40D_15,Q,So now you're on one [overtalking] 00:05:03 -
40D,40D_150,Q,Really?
40D,40D_151,A,Of course.
40D,40D_152,Q,It was who you knew and -
40D,40D_153,A,"[Overtalking] 00:44:43 Ian and I have known - Ian was the chair of the investment committee. Chris Cuffe was chairman of the A superannuation fund board. Ian - Chris was having to stand down because of - he'd come to the end of his term. Ian was going to take over as chair of A superannuation fund. They needed a new head of investment committee. Ian and I have known each other - we worked together in Treasury, back in the '70s."
40D,40D_154,Q,"Dear oh dear, you grew up together [laugh]."
40D,40D_155,A,"Well not quite, because he's Sydney based. But yeah, we've known each other literally since then and we've kept in touch as our careers have gone in different directions. He'd innocently just done a search, in a different context, for a senior investment person to go onto an investment company board of which he was chair and my name had - at the very end of the process, my name had come up as someone who'd just returned to Australia. So when this happened, he said - he'd chatted to a few people and he just reached out directly to me and said, mate, we've already - we did a search recently. I know who's around. Are you interested? So I then went through the formal process of interview."
40D,40D_156,A,"But that was an example of - now I'm going to now call it - I'm now going to contradict myself a little bit by saying I was being appointed as an independent director, but also to take on the role of chair of the investment committee. So the reality is that the pool of people who could do that role is actually very small."
40D,40D_157,Q,Yes. You were probably the best on offer -
40D,40D_158,A,"Well I'm obviously going to think I am. That's for other people to decide. But the point I'm making is this. It's not - a normal director role is probably a biggish potential pool. For something as specialist - it was like if we had someone to be - we wanted a specialist in an IT or something function - same thing. You'd end up with just a narrow group of people. But yeah, my process was, effectively, I knew the people. In fact, the investment committee - well the board of A superannuation fund - I mean, Chris Cuffe was chair. Ian Martin was one of the independent directors. Steve Somogyi, I worked with at National Mutual for many years. So there was three or four of them around the table that I actual knew."
40D,40D_159,Q,Well that's a good -
40D,40D_16,A,"I'm on A superannuation fund - no, it's not - A superannuation fund is not ASX listed. A superannuation fund is a - one of the bigger -"
40D,40D_160,A,"Which, at least in part, is just a reflection that - you know, Australia, and Melbourne in particular - it's a very small place."
40D,40D_161,Q,Yes. You talked about - you've got recent international experience. Is that also something that you - was that something that would be seen to have benefited A superannuation fund?
40D,40D_162,A,Yeah. I don't think A superannuation fund would have put that as high up their list as they probably should have.
40D,40D_163,Q,"But your - your colleagues who you know on there may well have said, look, this is also an add on - like a value add for us."
40D,40D_164,A,"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, that's probably fair. But I think what I'd want to - the point I'd want to make, in a broader context, is that unless you have that international experience, you're not going to see it as being valuable, so you're not going to be looking for it."
40D,40D_165,Q,Because you don't know what you don't know.
40D,40D_166,A,"Because you don't know. Precisely. You don't know what you - so if you're - and remember how the board structures work in terms of - they'll have a non-[inaudible] 00:47:53 nomination committee. So the nominations committee would be the one that would be doing the long list to short list, etcetera, undertaking the search. So the composition of that committee will very much influence the type of person that they're going to -"
40D,40D_167,Q,"Are they just put together - right, we need to appoint a new director and they just put together volunteers from the -"
40D,40D_168,A,"Yeah. Typically, yes. I mean, sometimes - sometimes boards will have a permanent standing - a permanent nominations committee. More - normally, it's something that's bought together as needed."
40D,40D_169,Q,I guess it depends - because the skills gap analysis -
40D,40D_17,Q,Member based.
40D,40D_170,A,Yeah. And [overtalking] 00:48:37 - precisely.
40D,40D_171,Q,- so it's people who understand that [gap] 00:48:41 -
40D,40D_172,A,"And the person who will chair it will be - if it's not the chairman or chairwoman themselves, it will be one of the more senior directors who will typically chair it."
40D,40D_173,Q,Is it a male chair at A superannuation fund or a female?
40D,40D_174,A,It is.
40D,40D_175,Q,Has it ever had a female?
40D,40D_176,A,Chair? No.
40D,40D_177,Q,"Were head hunters - you've mentioned, I think, the search had already been done. Is that - they used head hunters, did they?"
40D,40D_178,A,"They had for - not for this one, but they had for a previous one. The one that Ian had been involved in. So, looking at the role of [search firms] 00:49:13 and - and I suppose I've used them over my career for a long time. I think they can be very value adding. But remember what their job is. Their job is to get somebody in the seat. So they're, by definition - will go down the path of least resistance."
40D,40D_179,Q,So you think they contribute to the bias rather than remove it.
40D,40D_18,A,"Yeah, member based. It's one of the industry - well we call it industry, but it's better to call it a profit for member superannuation fund. I'm also on a small not-for-profit called Neurosciences Victoria."
40D,40D_180,A,"Absolutely. Now I'm sure there's some that try and - that do actually try to change it. But it's - what are you going to do? If you're being paid - I mean, the typical - I mean, you just - sorry, I'm just [pretty simple] 00:49:49. Self-interest is always working. So what's their self-interest? Their self-interest is to - they would like to get the search done, within reason, as quickly as possible with the least amount of effort that they need to put in, because that's going to maximise their relative return. I'm being extremely -"
40D,40D_181,Q,Yep. So they just have their list -
40D,40D_182,A,"But they will have their list. Right? So the board will come up and they may say, we would actually like a woman here. So that's going to make it hard for them. I've not had any - they may - we often - we talk about skills. We talk about skills based boards. So we say we want an IT person or a legal person or whatever and I - I never quite see that at all, for what it's worth. I'm maybe a bit different here. I don't see a lot of benefit in that."
40D,40D_183,Q,You don't see the benefit in that?
40D,40D_184,A,"No, I don't see a lot of benefit in that at all."
40D,40D_185,Q,Great. Tell me more about that.
40D,40D_186,A,"Well again, what sort of different perspective are they bringing? Just because they've got - boards will often say, we've got issues with IT, so what we need is an IT specialist on the board. And it's like, that is just a dumb thing to say. If you just think about it for 30 seconds; why do you think that's a sensible decision? What you need is to have a board that becomes more informed about IT issues. You need maybe to have a specialist committee - you know, an investment or a tech committee or something. Get some specialists in on that committee. But you don't need them at the - around the board table per se. I just think it's muddled - it's muddled thinking. It's much more important to have someone who's got a broader perspective on the business and is able to see technology in the context, for example, of the broad business."
40D,40D_187,Q,"Okay, can we - this is really good. Could we just - what are these essential features - I mean, diversity is here, but you did say knowledge of industry was essential and knowledge of the business model - knowledge and understanding. So there's something else. There's these core skills or core -"
40D,40D_188,A,"Well this is this core skill of understanding - so understanding what it - you know, what is the client's - what are the - what do the clients look like? How do you get - whatever the product or service that you're offering, how do you get it to the client? How do you make money? Because you've got to make money. How do you make money as a result of this? How do you square the circle between satisfying the client and making money for the organisation at the same time as having a workforce that's being looked after? So that's what I mean about the business model. They've got to understand the business model in its - at its highest level."
40D,40D_189,A,"Then you go down and say, okay, well then within that, where does risk fall? What are the risk related issues? Are there technology issues? Is there legal stuff? I mean, technically not. What are the specialist areas of expertise that you may want? So in a case like us, it's investment expertise. So you think about the things that you want. But you want those expertise to be in the context of a broader thing. That's not to say you don't have an IT - person who's got an IT background on the board. But that's not - that might be a necessary - but it sure as hell - it's not a sufficient condition to have them -"
40D,40D_19,Q,Excellent. You have so much experience. That's fantastic. What a find. Thank you. So I'm going to just say you sat on -
40D,40D_190,Q,[Not a sufficient reason to have them on the board] 00:53:01.
40D,40D_191,A,"In other words, you've got to have that broader understanding as well."
40D,40D_192,Q,That's really good. Thank you. Because those skills matrix things are used and spoken of a lot and this is a nice – could you bold that as well? This is a nice qualification on how it's used [overtalking] 00:53:22 -
40D,40D_193,A,"Yeah. Precisely. And the regulators, I think, get themselves very confused on this stuff actually, for what it's worth. And it's worth doing a segue on the regulators and understanding - trying to comprehend what their understanding of boards, board practices, businesses are. And the answer is, typically, not very good. [Long pause] because that's not the background they have."
40D,40D_194,Q,"Exactly. Do the boards that you're familiar with have any - no, this one. Do you feel that there are - that tensions can arise in the board selection process, on the one hand, obtaining that collegiate fit you're talking about, and on the other, trying to avoid group think?"
40D,40D_195,A,"For what it's worth, as you can tell, I don't think I've seen a lot of examples as to where they've been specifically trying to go out of their way to not get group think."
40D,40D_196,Q,"Exactly. So your concern is that this diversity, as you understand - thought or perspective to avoid group think is not being -"
40D,40D_197,A,I’m happy to be -
40D,40D_198,Q,[Overtalking] 00:54:35
40D,40D_199,A,I’m happy to be contradicted. But it's not something I've seen.
40D,40D_2,A,"[Inaudible] 00:00:39 how it's understood. Not well, I would have said. But [inaudible] [overtalking] 00:00:41 -"
40D,40D_20,A,"But I think, perversely, they're all second order to the fact that, from the mid'90s onwards, I would sit through all of the National Mutual, which became part of the AXA Group - their board meetings for Australia and New Zealand. Then similarly, when I joined Invesco, would sit at the Invesco - through all the Invesco board meetings since basically the beginning of 2007. So what I'm saying is that there's experience from being a member, but there's also the experience of 20 plus years of observing big-ish boards and their behaviours and the chairs and the chairs -"
40D,40D_200,Q,So on A superannuation fund as well - so you have to - because that's your experience frame. Although you gave an example where group think was avoided.
40D,40D_201,A,"As it happens, we do have, as I've said, I think a fair level of diversity. But it's been - I think it's been a fortunate outcome of the way in which the board - the directors are appointed rather than any sort of a priori aim to have [overtalking] 00:55:12. So it's not come at - the selection process - we have [inaudible] 00:55:17 - it's quite complicated. A superannuation fund - there's three independent directors. Then there's four people that are effectively appointed by, if you like, employees and employers. So hence the two VCs and then there's the two union folks. So they match off with each other. So that becomes three plus four is seven. Then I think there's four more."
40D,40D_202,A,"They come from a thing called the consultative committee, which is this weird context that exists - so you could become probably part of the consultative committee if you put your hand up to be nominated. And the consultative committee of - there's 150 of them - 70 of them - 150, I think - then select four people from their group. And two who are more employee representatives and two, again, that are more employer representatives. So again, we do the two-two. So we end up with this diversity because of the selection model."
40D,40D_203,Q,And that's part of the -
40D,40D_204,A,"Constitution, effectively."
40D,40D_205,Q,"So that is - okay, this is unusual."
40D,40D_206,A,This is very unusual.
40D,40D_207,Q,"So the selection criteria, which is governed by this, is not representative, in your view."
40D,40D_208,A,"No, it's quite different. And perversely -"
40D,40D_209,Q,[Overtalking] 00:56:35
40D,40D_21,Q,"And that's been in Australia, a lot of it."
40D,40D_210,A,"- it gets us - so if we look at the perspective of the regulator, they say, you've got to have a skills based board. You've got to have - when you're appointing a director, you should be clear about what the criteria are, etcetera. And if you think about our model, it's going to come in conflict with this because, (a) there's people who are certainly appointed - elected by the consultative committee that we don’t have control over. In other words, we can't say we'd like someone with - bad example - IT skills or HR skills or investment skills or whatever. Because they can select who they want. But perversely, we end up with actually a good -"
40D,40D_211,Q,A more diverse board and -
40D,40D_212,A,A diverse - the more diverse board as a result.
40D,40D_213,Q,"So in a way then, you're suggesting that the use of the skills matrix is -"
40D,40D_214,A,You've got to be -
40D,40D_215,Q,- can be a conservative element - can actually undermine diversity [overtalking] 00:57:31 -
40D,40D_216,A,I think it won't necessarily get you what you want.
40D,40D_217,Q,"Okay, it won't necessarily - one person raised this - I suggested this idea where you have your skills matrix, but then you extend it with diversity criteria as a way to try and bring the two together. Which was interesting."
40D,40D_218,A,"Yeah, which is possible."
40D,40D_219,Q,Do you feel that boards are familiar - are there any barriers to diversity - you've just gone through that.
40D,40D_22,A,"Well it's been in Australia, but a lot of it - it's been both in Australia and the US."
40D,40D_220,A,"Yeah, I think I have."
40D,40D_221,Q,And you can't overcome it because it's written in the constitution of the board. Except for the way you use your skills matrix could be modified. What I'm saying is your - your constitution - the constitution of A superannuation fund requires different processes feed in different directors. So there's a - the board itself does not have full control over who gets on it -
40D,40D_222,A,Yes.
40D,40D_223,Q,- is what I understand. Okay. So there's a lack of control. So then you've got your skills matrix; how much influence does that have over the parts that you don't have control over?
40D,40D_224,A,You can't have a lot.
40D,40D_225,Q,"You can't. Right. So you've got - but does it prevent diversity? You're saying no, well it actually adds to it because these feeders bring it in -"
40D,40D_226,A,I don't think it prevents it at all.
40D,40D_227,Q,"So it might make it harder for functioning of the board, but not really"
40D,40D_228,A,No.
40D,40D_229,Q,"- because you've described - the chair role is probably complex, but -"
40D,40D_23,Q,And there's - at a really interesting time.
40D,40D_230,A,Yeah.
40D,40D_231,Q,"Okay, last question. Ten years into the future, how would you like to see diversity of Australian boards?"
40D,40D_232,A,"In simple terms, I think I would absolutely love us to have some true - some actual true diversity as defined - as I've defined diversity. In other words, a diversity of thought and perspective. So people with different educational backgrounds, people with different cultural backgrounds, with different life experiences. And yes, both genders and so on. But we really need to be looking at diversity in this much broader context than I think we oftentimes think about it. And I think if you do that, you will end up with stronger boards."
40D,40D_233,A,"I know, in my time as the boss, if you like - it was something I would always say to my senior staff - is, please don't tell me what you think I want to hear, because I already know that. It's of no value to me at all. Only give me something that's a different perspective than the one I already have. That's the only thing that's going to add some value to me. Now the issue is that you need chairs and boards to have that mental attitude. So what they're wanting to actually - so they've got to go in there trying to get - with a deliberate aim to get a difference of thought and perspective and, therefore, thought around the table."
40D,40D_234,Q,"That's wonderful. And it fits in nicely with a hunch that the lead researchers for this research have - is that cognitive diversity, which is just a fancy word for what you've been talking about - the role it plays - so thank you very much. That's great."
40D,40D_235,A,Pleasure.
40D,40D_24,A,Yes.
40D,40D_25,Q,Observation. Beautiful. Well we'll draw on all of that. So your discipline background?
40D,40D_26,A,"I did economics at university; specifically economics and then moved to the Australian Treasury - so studied economics there. Or practised economics at the Australia Treasury for eight years. Then joined National Mutual as their chief economist and then moved into the investment side of their business in - it would have been mid-'80s. So '85 or '86. Then since then, basically been in what we'd call investment management. There's been periods where that's not been correct. I ran Australian [inaudible] 00:07:11 Life, which was a full-blown life insurer in Sydney for a couple of years. But predominantly, it's been - so there's been some wrinkles, but predominantly investment management."
40D,40D_27,Q,It's a bit of a gap because not many interviewees have such a grounding in the finance sector - like the investment sector. So this is good. We've had quite a spread - who had some - but this is one of the less areas. So that's good.
40D,40D_28,A,Right. I think what's important to reflect on here is that the investment background means that we're the people who are investing in the companies that have the boards.
40D,40D_29,Q,"Oh, okay. Now I've interviewed some - an organisation that is - it used to have private equity in the - it's just changed its acronym. It's an Australian organisation that influences [long pause] private capital - provision of private capital to startups and other companies."
40D,40D_3,Q,"Well, how different people understand it. There's probably different ways that people understand it. So it will be good."
40D,40D_30,A,"Okay. Well that tends to be pretty small, so they'll tend to be private - that will be private investing rather than public investing."
40D,40D_31,Q,"Okay, so this is public investing."
40D,40D_32,A,"We could use A superannuation fund - I could use Invesco. When I was looking - when I was with Invesco, the groups I was looking after were managing US$250 billion; so bigger than anything here in Australia. So we're, by definition, investing in the biggest - the major corporations, etcetera. Therefore, the teams that were working for me, we were going to be the people that were actually voting on all of the different board resolutions that were being put forward. So it's actually us that were actually influencing all the - all of this."
40D,40D_33,A,"And if we put it in the Australian context, which is what you're wanting; the big superannuation funds are the people who actually control the assets these days. So again, we're the people who will be actually - and for us, as A superannuation fund, we will be doing this behind the scenes rather than - we'll be doing it privately rather than publicly. But we'll be the ones who'll be influencing the boards and trying to give them some advice as to what they should and maybe should not do. They sometimes listen to us, they sometimes don't."
40D,40D_34,Q,Do you sit on boards? Do you have -
40D,40D_35,A,"No. And therein lies the conflict. And it's something I hadn't really appreciated is the truth - [and later] 00:09:48 when I joined A superannuation fund - and I'm chair of the investment committee. So the investment committee - in fact, I've just come from a meeting with our chief investment guy, John Pearce. So I end up being a bit conflicted because any of the - I mean, we will have major investments in lots of the major corporations so, all of a sudden, I can really appreciate - but I'm effectively a bit conflicted out of a lot of them. So no, we don't sit on [overtalking] 00:10:11."
40D,40D_36,Q,"Yes, to sit on [overtalking] 00:10:12 -"
40D,40D_37,A,"The only time any of our teams will sit on boards is where we've got - it's an unlisted entity – so, not listed on a stock exchange, but unlisted - so private, if you like. And if we've got a major holding in the company, we may have board seats associated with that, so there will be some of the investment team who might sit on those boards."
40D,40D_38,Q,"Is that because, if it's a listed company, you're happy with the regulatory framework, and you're not if it's not listed?"
40D,40D_39,A,"When it's a listed entity, the process for director election is one where you will typically have not an alignment between shareholders and directors. In a private entity, you will typically do the reverse. So what you're wanting in a listed entity is for these directors to be ""independent"". So if it's – well, let's use CBA. If it's Commonwealth Bank [inaudible] 00:11:13 – well, ANZ was [inaudible] 00:11:14 a good one. So if it's ANZ or NAB, even though we might hold - pick a number, just to make it up. If we hold 3% of the shares, that's probably not big enough to be given a board seat in the normal scheme of things."
40D,40D_4,A,Agreed.
40D,40D_40,A,"But more to the point, what you don't want is that these shareholders who've got board seats - you're wanting the seven or eight directors or whatever it is to be seen to be properly independent; so not aligned with any shareholder. By contrast, in private - in a privately held vehicle, that tends to be the reverse. Because you're wanting a different alignment of interests."
40D,40D_41,Q,"So you could sit on boards of private, not listed [overtalking] 00:11:55 -"
40D,40D_42,A,"Yeah. Yeah. That would be my expectation, yes."
40D,40D_43,Q,"So first, how do you - so you can look back to the '80s. How has the composition of boards in Australia changed over time in terms of diversity?"
40D,40D_44,A,Not much.
40D,40D_45,Q,Really? Wow.
40D,40D_46,A,"No, I don't think so. Do you? Can I go back and say, do you - what do you mean by diversity? Can I tell you -"
40D,40D_47,Q,"Well this is your - this is the question. No, you tell me what you think. Because [overtalking] 00:12:25 -"
40D,40D_48,A,"Okay. Well let me maybe - let me maybe tell you what I think about diversity and then, if I haven't touched on all the things that you were hoping to touch on, happy to come back. I think the first thing is to be clear about what we mean by diversity. And the way I think about diversity is that it means that you've got a group of people sitting around the board people - around the board table, sorry, who have a diversity of thought or perspective. [Long pause] so that's the - my sort of - this is the key definition. So diversity doesn't mean that you're a different colour or a different gender. That doesn't mean diversity at all. And I'll come back to that."
40D,40D_49,A,"The next thing to say is that, in a board, it's fine - and we'll get to what I define as diversity in a second. Okay? But what I would say to you is that, above and beyond all of that, any board member must actually have what I would see as two critical criteria to be an effective board member. The first one is they must have a knowledge of the industry in which they're - the company is operating. And hopefully they have both knowledge and understanding of the industry and the company and, in particular, how that company does business, how it generates revenue and how it generates profit. Because what is the - a proper detailed understanding of the business or business model."
40D,40D_5,Q,For how many years have you been a board director?
40D,40D_50,A,"And the reason I'm saying this is that - and I'm sure you've seen the research by [McKinsey] 00:14:09, which highlighted that only a third of directors of the ASX 100 or 200 - I don't know if they surveyed all of them. I don't know. Only a third of them actually understood how the company that they were sitting on the board of generated what their business was - or was - how they actually generated a profit."
40D,40D_51,A,"So the reason I'm starting there is that you can be as diverse as you like, but your opinion is not going to be respected around the board table if you don't actually know how the business works. So it's fine to talk about [laugh] diversity in any way you want to; but if you're one of the people who's supposed to be the diverse one sitting around the table and you don't actually understand how the company works, your views are not going to be listened to. So if you're thinking about diversity from - so you can have diversity from the perspective that I can tick a box for somebody who's doing a questionnaire - you know, how many members have you got that are female and these - you know, males, females, etcetera. But if you're actually wanting diversity, you're going to have to have, as a starting point, members of the board who actually understand -"
40D,40D_52,A,"So then you get to this point of, okay, if we're going to want - if we're defining diversity as being a different perspective, what does that mean? That, to me, means that you're probably going to need people that have a different educational background. So this means you've got to get away from what I think of in the UK parlance is the Oxbridge syndrome. Now you've heard -"
40D,40D_53,Q,[Inaudible] [overtalking] 00:15:47
40D,40D_54,A,"So Oxbridge - one of the critical things about the UK is that all the senior positions in the UK are heavily dominated by people from Oxford or Cambridge University. Hence Oxbridge - the combination of the two. And it's the politicians on both sides. It's not just the Conservatives, but it's the Labour Party. It is big business. It is the boards. It is the BBC. It's Sky News or whatever. It is all the major institutions. It's all the senior bureaucrats, etcetera. They're basically - the numbers are scary in places; 70%, 80% are Oxbridge. So these people, they've all had the same education."
40D,40D_55,A,"You're then going to say, well the second one we could have a difference in perspective is that maybe you've got some cultural differences; you've come from different culture in terms of - or else you've had a different background. So you've had a different set of experiences. What that would mean would be something, for example, like location."
40D,40D_56,A,"In other words, if everybody comes - and let's use - we're here in Melbourne. If they've all come from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, they've all gone to the private schools - and look, I was one of them. I went to Wesley College and all that. But if we've all come from that same - at least I live on the northern suburbs in Ascot Vale. I'm just north of the city. But seriously, if they've all - if everybody on your board - and I don’t care what colour or gender they are. If they've all come from the eastern suburbs, they've all gone to the same group of private schools, they've ended up going through the same universities; they're going to think basically the same. You therefore get - and that's at a - so they - and they do think differently than if you want to go out to the western suburbs or northern suburbs - I mean, there are differences here."
40D,40D_57,A,"Then you've got the issue of Australia versus OS. In other words, if the people - if they've been predominantly - is most of their experience domestic compared to someone who's had overseas experience? So for someone like myself; lived and worked in Hong Kong, lived and worked in UK, lived and worked in the US, so obviously my perspective on the world is going to be different than the people I interact with who are - frankly, they've travelled, but they've never actually had to deal, business wise, with people outside Australia."
40D,40D_58,A,"So obviously we can be different with gender. There are clear gender differences. So yes, gender's going to be one of the bases for difference, the same as culture. So if you've got - and I suppose even, in a way, religious background I think's - particularly if you're Islamic; that's going to probably give you a little bit of difference. But then it comes down to experience. So how different is your experience?"
40D,40D_59,A,"The reason I'm going with all of these is that if you look at the way that the boards go through the process of selecting people, what do they do? They select people that the board knows. They select people that are like them. They select people that are not going to rock the boat. Because there's -"
40D,40D_6,A,"The first board I would have been a director of would have been back in the '90s. I sent my CV to Suzanne just a day or two ago, so it's - I mean, the first - I was on what we called listed investment company boards which were - these were ASX listed - and this would have been back in the '90s. It was even late '80s."
40D,40D_60,Q,Have you seen this [overtalking] 00:18:56 -
40D,40D_61,A,"Well I just look at any of the boards [laugh]. If you watch the process actually operate - and there is, of course, safety in numbers here. Right? We'll go all the way back to my first point; that only a third of them - only a third of them actually understand what they're doing. I don't know how many board members you've been able to speak to. But the number of them out there that are sitting on a board where they know nothing about the company - and occasionally [inaudible] 00:19:23 -"
40D,40D_62,A,"You can tell I'm a bit direct sometimes. I'll say to – I mean, effectively, say to them, “Why are you on this board?” It's like, well they asked me. And it's like, well sure, I can understand that. But do you understand the risk you're taking, as a board member, and particularly in today's environment - and they might be on a [inaudible] 00:19:44 -"
40D,40D_63,A,"I was chatting to someone who was on the Myer board and Myer was doing this as an organisation. For all I know, it still could be. We don't really know what's going on in the background there. What does this person - have you ever had any experience in retail? No. Okay, what's your background? It's in property. Right, okay. So tell me how being good in property fits you - it means you're a good fit for being on the Myer board. And the answer is no, other than the fact that he was asked and it seemed like one that he'd - this individual may have thought was going to look good on his CV. So, this safety in numbers means that you actually probably -"
40D,40D_64,A,"A lot of the time, boards - don't believe that boards are actually trying to select people that are giving them true diversity. All right? I mean, they will probably be going down a track where, if there's pressure on them for diversity - say, gender diversity, well, they'll go and try and find a woman when they might have otherwise been looking for a bloke."
40D,40D_65,A,"But what they're going to do is they're going to find a woman that looks very much like the man that they would have appointed. In other words, someone like them. Someone who's not going to rock the boat. Someone who's got the same sort of background and upbringing as they do. It goes back to this safety in numbers, because if things go wrong, you're going to want to be [laugh] - they're going to want you to be - the board's going to want for everybody to be aligned. You only have to watch the banks and AMP. Well AMP's a good example of it. It's just been scary."
40D,40D_66,Q,"So the gender target issue - it's not effective then, from your point of view, because gender can still be the same from this thought or perspective point of view."
40D,40D_67,A,Absolutely.
40D,40D_68,Q,"Indeed, the selection criteria is biased towards same thought or experience."
40D,40D_69,A,Right. So if you look -
40D,40D_7,Q,Was this before the big crash?
40D,40D_70,Q,Is that it?
40D,40D_71,A,"Precisely. And if you look - if you factually - and say, I'm just looking at the facts when I go - so if you look at the actual facts - you look at the pool of people and how small the pool of people who it is that sit on, say, the eight - the top companies. The ASX 50 or 100. Very small. And if you look ditto at the women who are now coming onto the boards - and all power to them, frankly. I think it's great that we're actually doing this, because it's at least a little bit of push in a different direction. But the same thing; there's a very small group - and that's been reported a couple of times recently. It's a very small group of women who are ending up being the - if you like, the diversifying person on a lot of these boards. So the boards - it goes back to this point that they struggle to - to actually get people with properly different perspectives because they're going back around selecting people like them."
40D,40D_72,Q,We'll move onto there soon. But with A superannuation fund and the not-for-profit that you're on - the other one - what's the - what do the boards look like there?
40D,40D_73,A,"Perversely, the A superannuation fund board's actually got a bit of proper diversity around the table."
40D,40D_74,Q,In terms of perspective and -
40D,40D_75,A,"Yeah. What have we got? We've got - on the board, we've got someone who's a senior academic. She is a - I mean, is a she, so she's a full-time academic, spent her career there. You know what people like that are like. We've got a couple of people like myself who have had a long career in financial services at a very senior level; so our chairman, Ian Martin, and myself - our backgrounds would be quite similar. So come from a very strong business background."
40D,40D_76,A,"We've got a couple of guys who are from the union movement. These are people who have been union leaders typically. Grahame was head of the NTEU for - oh goodness, he's just retired. So some ridiculous time. Thirty-plus years. So he's a union guy by background. We've got someone who's an HR director, so he's actually an employee within - because we've got this odd construct in terms of how the board gets put together. We've got people who are actuaries. One of the other independent directors was someone - Nicolette Rubinsztein - so we've got actually diversity in terms of gender. But you can sense that -"
40D,40D_77,Q,"So what, 30%?"
40D,40D_78,A,"Goodness, I'd have to add it up. We've got Nicole, Nicolette, Lelia [long pause] and Jane. So it's four of 11."
40D,40D_79,Q,"It's 40, probably."
40D,40D_8,A,"Oh yeah, this was a long time ago. This is before the recession we had to have, etcetera. They're, if you like - well we don't call them that here, but they're listed investment companies, so they are - it was an ASX listed, etcetera. I don't think I was chairman of any of them. Then member of internal boards with the group - with National Mutual, AXA and then a group from a similar sort of timeframe. And was also on a not-for-profit, which was a private girls' school back in those days, and then ultimately chairman of that. I'd have to check my details, but was chairman of that back in the - that would have been - yeah, again, probably the latter part of the '90s. It would have been the late '90s, early 2000s. Then [sigh] goodness me, there was - there was a series of related boards thereafter."
40D,40D_80,A,"Yeah, nearly 40%. So we've got - and we've got two vice chancellors on the board. Jane den Hollander, who's with - [long pause] what's the one down in Geelong called?"
40D,40D_81,Q,Deakin.
40D,40D_82,A,"Deakin. That's right. And we've got Peter Dawkins from Victoria University. So we've got VCs. We've got two very senior, if you like, business execs in Ian and myself. So there is a diversity in terms of - if you think about it from the perspectives of gender; yeah, we do actually tick that box because we're probably 35%, 40%. But critically, in terms of what I think is diversity of thought, we've actually got people who look at the world differently. In other words, the world - the way I look at the world is not the same as our academic looks at - you know, the professor or whatever Lelia is. I mean, she looks at the world differently. Grahame, our NTEU guy, he looks at the world differently than both of us. So we are coming at the world from a different perspective."
40D,40D_83,A,"And that would contrast with, for example, the Invesco board, which is much, much more senior. If you just look at the composition - so this is Invesco - Invesco's the company I used to work for. It's the NYSE - the ultimate entity of - the group I work for - Invesco - the quality - if you look at the seniority of the people around that table; much, much higher. Much, much higher. But really not a lot of diversity in fact in terms of the backgrounds. We've got the odd token lawyer on there. So been a very senior partner of a law firm."
40D,40D_84,A,"We've got someone who is actually foreign affairs with - in the UK. So very senior bloke. Was actual ambassador to America for the Brits there for a number of years. Very senior guy. But he's an example of someone who's different, but he fails my first test up here of knowledge of the industry and understand - knowledge and understanding of the industry and the company. He doesn't actually understand how we work. So even though he's quite an opinionated person, his opinion doesn't honestly carry much -"
40D,40D_85,Q,So it's dismissed.
40D,40D_86,A,"[Just watching] 00:26:56 - yeah, in a polite way. But it's like they listen to Nigel and it's like, yeah, yeah, okay. But nah, Nigel doesn't know what he's talking about."
40D,40D_87,Q,What does the chair do?
40D,40D_88,A,"The chair's very good. The chair's been very good. I've had experience with some lousy chairs, but the chairs, for a lot of these companies that I've been on recently have been good. Very open. Gets all the views around the table. But it's not as though the chair's going to say anything to Nigel. But just the other folks will say, yeah Nigel, that's interesting. But however, my perspective might be. So then when you get the totality of the views -"
40D,40D_89,Q,It's not included really.
40D,40D_9,Q,Here in Australia?
40D,40D_90,A,"No. And it's not going to be. Look, the lawyers are another example. They struggle. If you've got a - these are very senior people. Very smart people, by definition. But the same thing applies. They don't actually understand how the business itself operates. Well then there's a very limited number of topics or issues where their opinion is actually going to be fully canvassed and considered."
40D,40D_91,Q,"If I gave you a scale - I'm interested to know how important you think diversity is, as you define it. Ten's extremely important and one is not important at all. What would you - where would you put it? Diversity as you define it, not -"
40D,40D_92,A,Diversity as I define it? How important it is at the board?
40D,40D_93,Q,Yep.
40D,40D_94,A,"Gee, seven. [Long pause] maybe eight even. I think it's very important. But it's very rarely seen."
40D,40D_95,Q,"Do you think that it's always been considered important - as you define it, has it always been important for boards? Or do you think it's been - it changed at some stage? In Australia."
40D,40D_96,A,I don't think it was important in the past and I think true diversity is not seen to be important today.
40D,40D_97,Q,As you define it.
40D,40D_98,A,As I define it. As I define it.
40D,40D_99,Q,"Okay, yep. No, this is important."
41IN,41IN_1,Q,Okay.
41IN,41IN_10,A,"Well, you don't need to de-identify. Everything I say can be put on the public record. I wouldn't be the least bit upset if it appears on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald. That’s the principle I have adopted throughout my career, okay?"
41IN,41IN_100,A,"So, are you doing your PhD or have you done it or what?"
41IN,41IN_101,Q,I've done my PhD and it's in the area of governance. Yep.
41IN,41IN_102,A,"Are you a research fellow or something, are you?"
41IN,41IN_103,Q,"Yeah, so I'm a research fellow on this project. Yeah."
41IN,41IN_104,A,"Fantastic. All right. La Trobe used to be a corporate member of Women on Boards for a number of years, in fact."
41IN,41IN_105,Q,Yes. I'm sorry to see it's not still.
41IN,41IN_106,A,"Well, no, no. We used those organisations for a number of years and then we tend to suggest to people that they fund a [unclear] 00:32:15 because 'We can do so much for you', you know?"
41IN,41IN_107,Q,"That's right. You probably exhausted us all. So, now, we want to understand how diversity influences board functioning. Do you feel that there are particular board functions that it can really help with? Well, you've sort of told me that it helps with - over here - better outcomes, customer focus and strategic planning or whatever."
41IN,41IN_108,A,"Yeah. You do have to be a bit careful that you don't stereotype your female board members, I think, is probably a way for [unclear] 00:32:52. We've got the HR committee, so we'll put the girls on it sort of thing. It doesn’t always work quite appropriately. Alternatively, because a HR or staffing issue comes to the board, some of the members ask Helen because she knows about those things. So, you've got to be a bit careful. I'm not sure I've answered your question."
41IN,41IN_109,Q,"No, that's a really good point. Can we drill down on that because as a chair of a number of boards, when you talked about - like, you define diversity and then it might matter depending on the business you're in and the strategy probably you're  about - why you're looking for someone new, I guess, the purpose behind that, then what - oh, dear, what was I going to say? I was going to say the stereotyping, how do you as chair know that it's not stereotyping, that it's genuine? What processes do you do? What procedures do you undertake to avoid it?"
41IN,41IN_11,Q,"Yep, perfect. That makes it very easy for me. Okay, fire away."
41IN,41IN_110,A,"Okay. This is during a board meeting, we're talking about, or -"
41IN,41IN_111,Q,I don’t know; when it happens.
41IN,41IN_112,A,- when I'm recruiting somebody?
41IN,41IN_113,Q,"Yeah, when you're recruiting. Yep, yep. I don't know if it happens in the board meeting or out of it."
41IN,41IN_114,A,"Okay, when you're recruiting somebody, it's an easy trap to hire somebody just like yourself. Given I'm a lunatic, I’ve got a habit of hiring lunatics. I mean, that's not meant to be quite literal, but we have - I'm a person of adventure who has got lots and lots of interests and who has got lots of good ideas, so it might be that I might hire somebody who is full of ideas and talks a lot. So, that might not be a good idea. That might be one form of stereotype. There is a temptation to say we've got these sorts of [unclear] 00:34:56 set of skills that we need in our board members, so we go and look for some of those, and then you don't do things like think a bit more outside the box. Well, perhaps a younger person or perhaps somebody from another culture, or perhaps somebody who isn't of a sort of scientific or rational background might be useful."
41IN,41IN_115,A,"So, it's very tempting to say here is our list of skills and we'll go and look for somebody like that. It's something that you have to be continually aware of and ask yourself the question: well, am I just hiring in my own image sort of thing? I mean, and it's quite hard to do that, so perhaps that's why you need a couple of people on the exercise sort of thing, or to just back and forth. So, generally boards that have got nominations, would need to be your next part. Often they’ve done the head hunt, but not always. Sometimes the head hunt is useful, but sometimes they're not. Some of the roles the head hunter is often trying to get on the board a bit more broadly, on the sort of person that might be suitable. I mean, the classic example is that we’ve got somebody to fill in the board of this energy company and of course they expect them to work in the energy sector. Well, that may not be a good idea, and I'd suggest that if it's a large developed company, it's probably a really poor idea. It's a bit like when people say - and they used to criticise the Myer Board years and years ago saying that it's got no retailers on it. And that was really a lobby that [unclear] 00:36:40 the legal and all that sort of stuff. But it was a bit short of retail people for a while, because they've got lots of other people. And perhaps they did need somebody from retail on the board, and I think they probably would have. It's always nice to have one subject matter expert type of person on your board, but you can go to a board and say we want everybody from retail. Now they've been in [the past] 00:37:06 moving consumer goods, and these people have been - more bulk good, or whatever, so that's diversity? I think not, sort of thing. But you can construct the argument that we're a diverse bunch by doing this old sub-dividing - a bit like the [unclear] 00:37:23 argument. You can sub-divide and sub-divide and say, well, we've got one of these, and one of these, and one of these, so we're diverse. And they're all from a very small band of something that is a larger issue."
41IN,41IN_116,Q,"Yeah, or they might all be from the Melbourne Club."
41IN,41IN_117,A,"Well, that could possibly be true. I had - you live in Melbourne, aren't you?"
41IN,41IN_118,Q,Yes.
41IN,41IN_119,A,I wouldn't dream of saying such a thing. [unclear] 00:37:54.
41IN,41IN_12,A,"Okay. So, some of the boards I'm on. I'm the executive chair of Women on Boards, which is probably why you are interviewing me; I'm the chair of a thing called the Australian Chocolate Company, affectionately called 'Charlie', which grows and manufactures chocolate in Queensland; I'm a chairman of a thing called AHSI, which is the Australian Health and Science Institute, which is an RTO that's got regulatory approval for taking international students; I'm also a director for the National Foundation for Australian Women, which is basically a social policy board; and, that is about it for the time being."
41IN,41IN_120,Q,It doesn't matter; that was just a line.
41IN,41IN_121,A,It was. That was just a line. We'll move on.
41IN,41IN_122,Q,"Yeah, we can move on. Now, look, I'm going to force you to take this one. There’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and board functioning and we want to explore that."
41IN,41IN_123,A,Do we?
41IN,41IN_124,Q,"Yeah, I'm afraid so. This one is an imposed question. So, what we sort of think of cognitive diversity as different ways of problem solving, different ways of understanding things, different ways of interpreting the world, so it's as distinct from different experience. So, do you feel the cognitive diversity influence -"
41IN,41IN_125,A,"Sorry, I missed that. You faded. Say that sentence again."
41IN,41IN_126,Q,Do you feel cognitive diversity influences a board's functioning?
41IN,41IN_127,A,"I'm sure it does and probably for the better. I mean, one of the examples that is often quoted is that when you've got a board of all males or all people who are accountants or they've all worked in business that's focused on profit, the most important item they always talk about is the financial reports. Now, this is a bit stylised, this example: when you then introduce some females onto that board who come from perhaps different backgrounds, the financials aren't the most important thing, or other things get talked about sort of thing. So, that could be the issue about this collection of people who we can call a team or we can call a board, but think in different ways. All that research that was done that was published in the Times magazine, was all about a diverse collection of people from either diverse IQ or diverse ways or preferences for thinking produces a better outcome than a bunch of geniuses or a bunch of people who are very similar sort of thing."
41IN,41IN_128,A,"So, in my terms, there's good arguments for having people who have got different ways of thinking. Now, it might piss people off a bit, because I'm the person who likes to - I'm action man. Let's make a decision. Other people who want to mull the issue around for and think of some of the other options, et cetera, and as a board member you have to understand that those people bring valuable insights and valuable contributions. And you just have to appreciate the differences that people bring, and that means as a chair that it's harder to run a board or manage a board  or whatever you want to call it when you've got people who are on different sort of parts of the thinking spectrum, or the action spectrum or whatever. But in the long run you will probably get a better outcome."
41IN,41IN_129,Q,"It's part of a good conversation, having a good conversation."
41IN,41IN_13,Q,"That's good. Well, look, I'll tell you, your chair experience could be very useful for us, because we're looking at diversity and processes around that. So, as a chair - so, I might sort of deviate from my form for women on boards perspective to include some questions around process, if that's okay. Yep, good. And so many industries - cool, excellent. So, we'll get on with it now, the questions. So, first, how have the composition of boards you're familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?"
41IN,41IN_130,A,"Yeah, a good conversation. But remember you can't spend all your time in board meetings having long and involved conversations."
41IN,41IN_131,Q,"Yeah, you do need the outcome."
41IN,41IN_132,A,"Yes, you do need the outcome. So, yes, all these things are balancing acts."
41IN,41IN_133,Q,"Yeah, that's why the diversity - so, as a chair do you think there's a special role that the chair plays in this?"
41IN,41IN_134,A,"Absolutely. I mean, you have an orchestra leader or a conductor which you challenge to the point where you do make decisions and you make them after due consideration. Well, that's a nice and easy thing to say, and the judgment is how much effort do you put into getting to the point where you can say it's time to make a decision? Because chairs judge in part, well, is this a well-running organisation that actually does things and makes decisions and progresses that strategic plan or whatever, but it doesn’t do it in a reckless way. So, with all that wisdom and judgement."
41IN,41IN_135,Q,"Yep, okay. So, inclusivity - do you as a chair try to be inclusive, include the different voices, but not let that end up being the point of the game? The point of the game is to actually make a good decision."
41IN,41IN_136,A,"Absolutely. I always expect everybody to have a say, even if they say I haven't got anything to say on this topic. So, I don't appreciate passengers who sit there quietly and never make a contribution. There are people who are a bit like that, they just sit there and they have probably read all the papers and they're just quiet. And one of the challenges is to get the best out of everybody around the board table. And so, you've got people who are quiet, and the sorts of people who are quiet are probably people from different sorts of backgrounds. Like, Asians won't sort of stand up and say my turn to speak. They need to be invited. You have to appreciate that sort of stuff as well, and you have to appreciate that perhaps new members are a bit hesitant to say much, and you've got to nurture that along. So, you really do have to get contributions from everybody, and some of the contributions might not be quite so much during the board meeting; it might be behind the scenes. Absolutely, I'm not doing my job as a chair if I can't get a contribution from all my board members. I mean, and although there are some boards that get [parodied] 00:43:53 that the chap or the girl - it's usually a chap who will never stop talking, or the person who always wants to talk on every topic."
41IN,41IN_137,A,"Now, the rules broadly speaking for a board meeting - because I don’t know how many agenda items [unclear] 00:44:08 item - you as a board member want half a dozen people who don't get to talk for every item, necessarily. You might get to the point where you say, I'm okay with that Mr Chairman, or Miss Chairman, or Madame Chairman, but you don't rattle on forever. So, discipline as well. So, that's another challenge for the chair, is to know that everybody gets to make a contribution, but it may not be on every item sort of thing."
41IN,41IN_138,Q,"Yeah, yep. Good. Do you think it's something that could be included on a matrix, these tools that people sometimes use to select board members? You know, where you analyse what you need, performance matrix, or whatever it is? It says you -"
41IN,41IN_139,A,You mean capacity to contribute?
41IN,41IN_14,A,"Okay, now, women on boards is later driven, and so, we have for the past almost ten years now collected a dataset called the 'Boardroom Diversity Index', which looks at, I think, typically rating sectors in the economy, so ASX200, ASX300, the evaluation board, government board, housing authorities, et cetera, so basically just about all of those sectors have shown a steady improvement in diversity as far as women are concerned on their boards. For example, if that's any help to you, Boardroom Diversity Index appears on our website, so ASX100 in 2010 was 11 or eight per cent women. It's now - when we did our last data collection in 2018, or the start of 2018, it was 29.3. We're due to do another data collection this year. For example, cooperative research centres have managed to get from 17.3 to 28.3. Credit unions have managed to rise from 21 to 37. The story is pretty consistent."
41IN,41IN_140,Q,Dear.
41IN,41IN_141,A,"Let's put it a different way. This is actually something a little bit easier than my International Directors' Program - the five energies of directors - and I've forgotten what they are, but hang on two secs and I'll find them for you. Normally you say you want board members that know something about accounting -"
41IN,41IN_142,Q,"Exactly, yeah."
41IN,41IN_143,A,"- that know something about, I don't know -"
41IN,41IN_144,Q,"Yeah, skills matrix. That’s it. The skills matrix."
41IN,41IN_145,A,"Skills matrix. But what about a version that says - I'll just put my spectacles on here, because it's quite small. High Fundamental Energy Battery according to Professor [Ludo] 00:45:41 is you've got emotional and relationship skills. Now, that usually does appear somewhere on the skills matrix, because it's usually split into skills and personal qualities. So, yeah. Inspirational skills. Gives sense to the [unclear] 00:45:57. You want people who are a bit enthusiastic about the business and make an inspired - and sort of encourage them. So, that’s another one. Rational and logical skills. You are basically, in a for-profit enterprise, dealing with people's money that they have given to you to do something useful with."
41IN,41IN_146,A,"So, your objective is to actually make them money in some shape or form, or to satisfy your customers or whatever. Now, there is a large component of rationality and logic behind these things. Then you've got to have people who have got the time to put into it and you avoid the glamour hunters, or people who are there because they've got a profile. Beware of those. And then you've got something called physical skills, which is the capacity to do the job sort of thing. So, if you were to analyse - assess people on those five elements, and then - sorry, another one is experience. So, you’ve got a range of experiences that are useful to [unclear] 00:47:07. So, that’s a quite different way of looking at a skills matrix shall we say."
41IN,41IN_147,Q,Yeah. Can I have a copy of that or is that private/confidential or something?
41IN,41IN_148,A,"No, that’s not confidential. I'll photograph it if you like."
41IN,41IN_149,Q,"That would be brilliant. Can I keep asking you questions, because I'm aware of the time?"
41IN,41IN_15,Q,"Yeah, across industries."
41IN,41IN_150,A,"Yeah, I can't photograph it at the same time."
41IN,41IN_151,Q,"Oh, it's on your mobile, of course."
41IN,41IN_152,A,"I'm talking on my mobile. My mobile can only do one thing at once, I'm sorry to say. When I'm talking, that's all I can do."
41IN,41IN_153,Q,"Oh, well. If you send it to me after, I would be very grateful."
41IN,41IN_154,A,"I can send it to you afterwards, and actually on the back it's got an enunciation of what those things mean. So, there's two sides to the card."
41IN,41IN_155,Q,"All right, I'll look for two pictures. So, can you think of any ways that - now, we'll talk about women on boards."
41IN,41IN_156,A,And you better send me another email with your email address on it.
41IN,41IN_157,Q,"I shall. I shall. Can you think of any ways that your organisation helps candidates from minority groups? So, do you do anything to help candidates from minority groups?"
41IN,41IN_158,A,What is a minority group by your definition?
41IN,41IN_159,Q,"Well, low socioeconomic background perhaps, people who can't afford to do the courses -"
41IN,41IN_16,A,"Clearly some people will say it's not quite fast enough, and women on boards, of course, have the view that it should be a 40/40/20 split."
41IN,41IN_160,A,"We always say that we will offer concession for people who claim poverty, or whatever, and we get a few people who approach us to do that, and we accommodate their needs generally speaking."
41IN,41IN_161,Q,"What about people from an Aboriginal background or backgrounds that - like, ethnicity, different ethnicities? And you might -"
41IN,41IN_162,A,"We've got hordes of members who look like they were born in China. In fact, they are Australians, but they are of Chinese or Vietnamese or whatever - I mean, I don't view those people as a minority as a member of Women on Boards, but the general community might view them as a minority. There's lots of highly-skilled women here from migrant backgrounds."
41IN,41IN_163,Q,And young people - are you helping young people get on?
41IN,41IN_164,A,"Yep, we are particularly keen to encourage young people to become board members."
41IN,41IN_165,Q,"Well, you are doing it."
41IN,41IN_166,A,"Yeah, and we do it. We do it. We have sessions called information evenings for young people and we send emails to our people and say, bring a young person along. And we spend a lot of time and energy explaining to young people they have a set of skills that many boards would be the better for having them."
41IN,41IN_167,Q,Beautiful.
41IN,41IN_168,A,Often they're reluctant. They think they haven’t got the experience.
41IN,41IN_169,Q,"Yeah, that’s great. I have interviewed one person in her late 20s, so I did well, I reckon."
41IN,41IN_17,Q,"A 40/40/20 split, did you say?"
41IN,41IN_170,A,Okay.
41IN,41IN_171,Q,"So, regulation - what do you see as the main barriers to building diverse boards in Australia and how do these barriers work?"
41IN,41IN_172,A,"Well, the main barriers - for example, when I went to an annual general meeting one year - some time ago, so times have changed a little - and I stood up and said, I note that you don't have any women on your board. Is this something that you're planning to do something about, and the chairman was so incredibly honest. He said, we never thought about it. And that actually is exactly true. They'd never noticed. So, the first barrier to have diverse boards is somebody has to notice that you don't have one."
41IN,41IN_173,A,"Now lots of boards do notice and they do something about it, but in times gone by for publicly-listed companies, remember there is no data on 'were there are any woman on listed company boards' that I could find before about 1995, and the only reason I had any data is because I met Adrian Clarke who was one of the first people in the story, as far as I could tell, to be on a publicly -listed board. So, clearly, nobody thought about it at all. I mean, that's the actual dilemma that we face when we say do, we need more diversity? People don't notice. It's like if there's one female on the board, that's okay. If there's two, the guys think there's been a takeover. I mean, it's like they're so unaccustomed. So, awareness-raising really is the first sort of battleground for improving diversity on board. And that is sort of happening. I mean, there's lots of topics, lots of talks about it, lots of articles and lots of media, so it's coming along, but that story I recounted to you of my visit to the AGM was probably 12 years ago."
41IN,41IN_174,Q,"Right, yep."
41IN,41IN_175,A,"So, yeah, just didn't occur to it, but it does now. So, that's one good thing."
41IN,41IN_176,Q,"Do you think regulation - you know how we've got people with targets; you've got targets, do you think that is a major factor in raising awareness and making it a visible problem/issue?"
41IN,41IN_177,A,"It's a major way of changing outcomes. I mean, the history is with the governments that have targets, some are longer than others, but even they - it's obvious; if 50 per cent of the voters are female and 50 per cent are male, and also some of your, I don't know, Liberal Party [unclear] 00:52:45 at Parliament are filled with Chinese ethnicities, then it raises your awareness level and public policy often precedes the behaviour in the board room or whatever. So, the activities the government has taken over the years and the public sector as well, they have more women in senior roles on boards, et cetera, is probably the thing that drags everybody else along to a very large extent. They very often get quite enough credit. They get lots of brickbats, sort of thing. But generally speaking, they've done the right thing. And the not-for-profit sector, of course, because they initially, no board members got paid, often there were lots of women on those - free labour type of thing, so there's always been a reasonable representation there. And the really poor areas are the things that are really in our Boardroom Diversity Index: listed companies, superannuation funds, credit unions in days gone by because - that was business. Always chaps, girls in business -"
41IN,41IN_178,Q,"Okay, so it was a business culture excluded -"
41IN,41IN_179,A,"Yeah, absolutely. Yeah."
41IN,41IN_18,A,"Yep, 40 men, 40 women per cent, and then seven per cent of either gender and/or because it's the numbers that really [speak out] 00:04:28."
41IN,41IN_180,Q,"So, that culture, would that also exclude, say, people who think in a more process way? Like, a business culture is more outcome-focused do you think, the cognitive diversity issue?"
41IN,41IN_181,A,"No, I don’t think so. I think if you're in the club, you're in the club. You can be left legged, or whatever, but if you're in the club, you are. So, in a funny sort of way, the club is quite tolerant. I mean, it might expect performance, it might expect competence, or it might not, but it's all part of it."
41IN,41IN_182,Q,"So, is this club still functioning, still effective now?"
41IN,41IN_183,A,"Well, how many football clubs do you know about? How many - I mean, the clubs are always effective. Tribes are always effective. It's just a question of which clubs they're in predominantly, and are they in any way changing their views? And, in fact, they're being pressured by things like government expect women on boards, times are changing. Clubs, often if they have premises, they discover that they're running out of members and they need women. I mean, the reality in Sydney - there's a couple of the stodgy old male clubs that don't make any money anymore, so they need extra members. Where are we going to get them from?"
41IN,41IN_184,Q,Yeah. Who don't need to be paid?
41IN,41IN_185,A,"What sort of - the practical outcome. But if you say, well, we're looking for another board member who is, you know - remember that one of the great benefits of Australian society is that we have a cadre of accountants and lawyers and bankers who, in fact, are very good at what they do, and the glue to make sure that we can do transactions at a cheaper cost than other places perhaps, is trust, longevity and the club. So, you can't completely shoot down the club. It's the glue that holds our professional services world together, which is the facilitators of business and all that sort of stuff, or the servants of business, et cetera, et cetera. So, clearly [unclear] 00:56:34 if you went to university with somebody 40 years ago and you're now a senior partner or whatever you are, or a CEO in something, then clearly will have those relationships. We always say that networking is really, really important and is absolutely, because you can call upon someone [over talk] 00:56:53."
41IN,41IN_186,Q,"Okay, so cronyism, how do you as a chair of a board and how do you as a person - you know, very influential in Women on Boards, how do you try to prevent the problems of cronyism limiting or undermining your strategy to have adequate diversity?"
41IN,41IN_187,A,"Okay. Now, there is a strategy called 'Fund it Forward'. You offer assistance to people and that means that at some point they owe you a favour. Now, if it works the other way and you decide not to offer assistance but you ask for favours, you are then beholden. And once you are beholden, then the [unclear] 00:57:38 sets in. So, that is my simple solution, be alert. Don't put yourself in a position where you can be subject to an influence that will result in cronyism. So, that is a bit of a pure answer, but I'm sure no-one else has given you that answer."
41IN,41IN_188,Q,"Definitely not. I love it. Okay. So, gender targets, what do you think? Quotas, targets, do you think they're good?"
41IN,41IN_189,A,"Measured targets are a fine idea. We do that all the time. We've got targets for how much money we're going to make, how many senior memberships we're going to have, how many gender break-ups of our senior membership. Quotas - there's not much difference between a measured target and a quota other than the brouhaha that goes with it. Quotas are not a good idea if you want to change people's behaviours because - particularly with regards to women on Boards. I mean, the reasons behind that. Despite that, of course, the federal cabinet has got quotas, you realise, from a geographic base and, in the case of the liberal nationals, you have party vote. So, there are lots of quotas about, but when we talk about quotas for women it’s an entirely different matter. It's been a really bad thing. So, it might be a bad thing but not for the reasons that -"
41IN,41IN_19,Q,"Okay, perfect. Are there other kinds of diversity that you think matter?"
41IN,41IN_190,Q,"Can you tell me why you think it's a bad thing, please?"
41IN,41IN_191,A,"Well, I think it's a bad thing because you can do it in a way that is less confronting by having a managed target and it's a bad thing because the downside of quotas is often women will say they only want me because I'm female. They don't understand that even if you have a quota, you actually have to find some skilled people. And in fact, it means you have to go and look harder; it doesn't mean you sacrifice quality because of the quota. But the rhetoric behind quota is such that people will say, oh, you're forcing us to do this, this or this with any old woman or any old Asian or any old left-legged whatever on our board. And it's just bad karma, because sometimes you do get that outcome. Often if you say to somebody in an organisation, the top priority - well, the old brush and shoe example. We want to have maximum production of shoes out of our factory, so the best way of achieving that is you produce right foot, size 8. And you get unintended consequences. Or, people perform - men that are a bit silly, and don't underestimate people's capacity to actually follow the instruction and not think about it."
41IN,41IN_192,Q,"Yeah, exactly. It's the easy way. Look, 41IN, I'm aware of the time. This has to be a gift from you if you answer this question.  We can't have, I owe you anything. Ten years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards and why do you think it will be good?"
41IN,41IN_193,A,"Well, clearly, we struggle in Australia to find our place - sorry, first up, an open-trading economy is what we are. We're struggling to maintain our place in the region, as other countries do better. That’s all taken as a given. We have a huge resource available from the people in Australia, because lots of them work [unclear] 01:01:11, including me. So, if you can't value that difference/diversity, then you’ve missed the boat. And that's the bottom line, in my terms. So, we can envisage that we will move on from the argument about women and certainly the argument about more Asian persons or migrants or whatever you want to call them in leadership in Australian companies is gaining pretty good. That will increase over time, I'm sure."
41IN,41IN_194,Q,That's fantastic. That’s fantastic. I think that is a really good way to conclude this because it is such a strong economic argument and that is great from a business perspective.
41IN,41IN_195,A,"Yeah, I am a business person after all."
41IN,41IN_196,Q,I can tell.
41IN,41IN_197,A,"Now, paying it forward, I'm not going to send you a selection of Charlie's chocolates, but being the chairman of Charlie's Chocolates, we make sensational chocolate and its award-winning and we don't use slave labour. So, there you go, all of my worthy efforts."
41IN,41IN_198,Q,"That's wonderful. You're a scream. Well, I'll just turn this off."
41IN,41IN_199,Q,END OF TRANSCRIPT
41IN,41IN_2,A,That's fine.
41IN,41IN_20,A,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I was the gender diversity - the leading index for diversity, and  after you've got women on boards, that we should start on the thing that is easiest to do something about, which is there was a ready supply for women to sit on board seats, but clearly things like geography are important; things like ethnicity are important, although that's quite - that's harder to find people; and people who are not born here necessarily. So, they're all important, but they’re more difficult to tackle, and our aim is women on boards. Okay?"
41IN,41IN_21,Q,"Yeah, from your organisation. I know. Okay. That's good. So, can you explain how Women on Boards seeks to influence Australian boards?"
41IN,41IN_22,A,"Yeah, I can. Well, we do it at a strategic level, so we advocate in the public domain. We talk to politicians, we talk to company directors, we talk to chairs, we put it up on our website, we've got a large membership and we seek to put forward the argument that diversity is important. That's the first top-tier activity."
41IN,41IN_23,Q,"Can I just clarify? When you advocate, is it for gender only or do you include the other kinds of diversity you mentioned?"
41IN,41IN_24,A,"We advocate for all sorts of things to do with women's aspirations towards leadership. So, we obviously advocate for more women on boards and in leadership positions, but generally it's women that we advocate for. But we also advocate on matters like gender pay gap, paid parental leave, et cetera, those issues that impact women's capacity to offer themselves to leadership roles. That’s quite a broad remit and a lot of that we do in conjunction with the National Foundation for Australian Women and some of it we do ourselves sort of thing. So, it's a pretty broad remit sort of thing."
41IN,41IN_25,Q,"Yep. So, you advocate in the public domain - yep."
41IN,41IN_26,A,"The next thing we do is we offer experiences to women and men, who wish to come along, to enable them to understand what it is to be a board member, how they get there, and give them a good network to assist them in that regard. You can call that workshops, seminars, if you like, but it's a bit broader than that. And the third thing we do, is because - it's like the management cycle: we then have to offer up people board opportunities for them to apply for, so we started off on the premise that transparency and openness are a preferred way of hiring board members, but the world doesn’t necessarily agree with us on that foot. Many people don't do it that way still, but it is increasing. So, since about 2005 we've had a board, jobs board, and first week in we had 25 new postings this week and there's [unclear] 00:07:54 available things on our website. Something for everybody. So, that gives people something to aim for. So, that is the third chunk of our platform. Now, we do do other things as well, so we have a program that's called WOBSX, which is relatively new  and sort of innovative in the sense that it aims to enable women to access hard-to-find boards, which is principally ASX, because the majority of those are done by word of mouth in some shape or form, so we're trying to attack the rest of ASX and other boards that are not available for public advertising. That's one new thing that we do."
41IN,41IN_27,Q,"So, what was that called again?"
41IN,41IN_28,A,"WOBSX, and that's on our website as well, if you want more information. So, we do a whole range of things, and of course, we've got members from all around the world. We've got corporate members and so we can really influence these [unclear] 00:09:08."
41IN,41IN_29,Q,"Good. Okay, that's great. And how important, then - or, first of all, how effective do you think these four strategies are and is one sort of more effective than the others?"
41IN,41IN_3,Q,"Fantastic. I'll call you 41IN, but I'll remove your name from the transcript when it's finished."
41IN,41IN_30,A,They're all - it's a holistic thing.
41IN,41IN_31,Q,"Yeah, they all work together."
41IN,41IN_32,A,"You can't do one without - well, you can do one without the other, but if your aim is to get more women on the boards, you've got to actually complete the cycle somehow. Remember that until about 2002, when Catalyst in the United States started their website and their research into women on boards, and their data collection exercises, there was no data available really about women on boards, about women in leadership. And it's sort of interesting that even today you'll discover that many datasets that get collected don't differentiate on the basis of gender, which is pretty sort of interesting really. So, if they don't differentiae on the basis of gender, they're unlikely to differentiate on the basis of any of the other diversity elements, and one of the things - in fact, the National Foundation for Australian Women did was encourage the ABS to have a gendered basis theory, which indeed, they do have and is available and talks about female participate in the workforce and what they earn and a range of other things. So, it's not obvious that women are catered for. It's easy to forget about them and not to collect the data. If you don't collect the data, you've just go no basis for putting forward a rational position."
41IN,41IN_33,Q,"I'm just thinking now, because we're moving to a plural - very diverse understandings of gender, of sexual identity and things like that, the 'other' box is growing instead of male/female/other. Do you think this might be a threat to your data or -"
41IN,41IN_34,A,"Not particularly. I mean, I take a sort probably not very modern view about gender. Gender is - perhaps it is modern - gender in my terms has always been a continuum. There’s not been definitively male or definitively female, and along the spectrum is people who have got characteristics that you can define as this, that and everything else. Last I heard they were reporting three different genders, that we name them on the list."
41IN,41IN_35,Q,"Yeah, that’s what I'm thinking. Yeah."
41IN,41IN_36,A,"I mean, I just think that is such a small portion of the population. These people are desperate to be heard and to be considered and to be recognised, and that's all fine, but statistically it's insignificant."
41IN,41IN_37,Q,"Okay, fine. So, that won't affect - I'm just thinking in terms of the future if this trend continues, it might affect the use of data, the way you use data."
41IN,41IN_38,A,"I don’t think so, because the other point is there's so much difference of opinion about what these sub-categories, [unclear] 00:12:26 are, but I think that that is not a very fruitful way of collecting data."
41IN,41IN_39,Q,"Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's good. It was just a bit of an aside."
41IN,41IN_4,A,"Oh, don't worry."
41IN,41IN_40,A,Personally. That's an old-fashioned way to [over talk] 00:12:36 -
41IN,41IN_41,Q,"Yeah, it's okay. That's good. Happy to have it. How important do you think it is to have a diverse board? If I give you a scale - don't be too critical of it: one is it's not important at all, and ten is it's extremely important, where would you put it?"
41IN,41IN_42,A,"Well, I'd say it's extremely important, wouldn’t I?"
41IN,41IN_43,Q,Yeah. Well just that you've got to say it. [laughs] Good on you.
41IN,41IN_44,A,"Okay. I mean, I'd so want to tell you, but there's too many items in the list."
41IN,41IN_45,Q,"Yeah, yeah. So, why do you -"
41IN,41IN_46,A,"I mean, there's lots of evidence that suggests that diverse boards, diverse teams perform better. Okay, or produce better outcomes. There's some research that suggests it's not a significant factor, but that's in the minority sort of thing. When you talk - a lot of the research is anecdotal, you go and talk to people and say, what is different when you have female board members and stuff like that. But if you haven't got a board that represents, firstly, your customers, you're really not going to do terribly well, are you? And most people have customers who are equally, or if not more, predominantly female than male. That is just one example why logically you would speak - you would want different perspectives on your board."
41IN,41IN_47,A,"And that's the principal thing that people say diversity brings to the board. It brings different perspectives, you talk about different topics, you've perhaps got different priorities. That’s why it's important, because you get a better conversation and you consider more options than perhaps you would have if you were a board that was only sort of anodyne, or standard or visual sort of background."
41IN,41IN_48,Q,"Now, look, your experience as a chair on a number of boards, have you seen this? Can you give me an example of perhaps where diversity has contributed to these multiple perspectives and whatever, and perhaps where it has limited - there hasn't been sufficient diversity so you feel the decision has been poor as a result?"
41IN,41IN_49,A,"Well, the fact that I'm on the board makes it diverse, okay? So, truly it's a highly-performing board, I'd say, sufficiently. An example, back to my data example. When I was chair of Australian Ethical Superannuation, we used to get reports every time we had the board meeting, about our membership base, and when I got there, we had members. Shortly after this we had female members and male members, and that was important because you and I probably realise that there are different outcomes which regard superannuation for males and females, and you might want to do different things in your marketing or whatever to your cohort of members - I mean, just as you might different messages to your younger superannuation members as compared to your superannuation members who are near retirement. Of course, you would, because they’ve got different circumstances, but as do males and females. That's just an example. As I said, because I'm a female on a board and usually there's more than one female, I can't really say a lot about why it was better. Yeah."
41IN,41IN_5,Q,"Okay. Well, 41IN, can I just get some demographics first? Your discipline background? Are you an accountant? Are you a lawyer?"
41IN,41IN_50,Q,Have you been on a board where there is perhaps only women and so lacking diversity because of that?
41IN,41IN_51,A,"I have, actually, the National Foundation for Australian Women only has female board members, at least today, and I suspect it might benefit from having a male board member sort of thing. And another example is the Netball board, Netball Australia. Traditionally, it's occasionally had a male on it, but usually it's all female, and clearly I think - they're doing quite well, netball, as regards promoting the sport and getting financial support and stuff, but I would have thought a male or two board members would be quite useful, apart from the fact no males apply. I don't know."
41IN,41IN_52,Q,"Well, it's interesting, isn't it? What is the barrier? It could be illuminating."
41IN,41IN_53,A,"Well, yeah, netball has done a really good job doing sort of joint ventures, if you could call it that, with AFL clubs in Melbourne, so in that sense they are, in fact, pretty aware of that sort of thing."
41IN,41IN_54,Q,Yeah. Sort of building alliances or -
41IN,41IN_55,A,"Yeah, and that's perhaps the proxy for having males on your board in a funny sort of way, or a first step perhaps."
41IN,41IN_56,Q,"Yeah. Do you think, how would it work? What, at a cultural level, like a social level?"
41IN,41IN_57,A,"I don't know. I mean, I can only -"
41IN,41IN_58,Q,"Yeah, hypothesise."
41IN,41IN_59,A,-@ make up a story.
41IN,41IN_6,A,"I've done a lot of things. I started off in - I did computing to begin with, and then I became an accountant, and then I generally became a company director."
41IN,41IN_60,Q,You haven't seen it happen. Okay.
41IN,41IN_61,A,I suggest you might go and talk to the netball people.
41IN,41IN_62,Q,"Yeah, okay. That’s a good idea. I'll keep it in mind. But we're at the end. Anyway, do you think there's any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating? For example, in a situation of high uncertainty or high risk?"
41IN,41IN_63,A,"A few stereotypes float about, but women get nervous when there's high uncertainty and high risk, and so some chairs have been known to say that the women don't sort of pull their weight. Those comments haven't been made very often. I don't know if that's true or false. I mean, women are perhaps a little bit more cautious than men about some things, a bit more careful perhaps about some things, but I'm not sure, really. I mean, I would say that if you're a board member, you're a board member, and it comes with risks and uncertainty. If you're a board member you've got to understand that you operate in an environment where you don't have all the information, so you're making decisions in circumstances where you're not all knowing, and there are always risks on the horizon that perhaps you have not contemplated. That's the life and times of being a board member and that's what you have to realise when you take on the challenge."
41IN,41IN_64,A,"Now, if you're joining the local P&C or the local - well, think of the local disability services provider. There are hordes of organisations with boards that need board members. Would you think that's a high-risk area to get into or not, compared with, say, a large mining company that might have an accident at its mine? Not sure what the answer is. Certainly, the actions of the mine well get more publicity, but then again, it might not. So, your questioning is a bit general, I think. I think there is probably a perception out there among some people that if there is a terrible crisis, you don't want too many females on your board, but I just think that is probably a very narrow view. Experienced board members are experienced board members, and they understand the ups and downs and the risks in these spaces, good ones, anyway."
41IN,41IN_65,Q,And you're building that capacity through your programs and that.
41IN,41IN_66,A,"Yeah. And the talks I'm giving this year - I've got about three to give in the next little while, and I've already given a couple - are really trying to impress upon people that if you want to be a board member you've got to think about how you operate in a situation where you don't know everything and decisions are often not black and white, and you have to understand that you have to compromise. It's like the modern version of how teams work, really, in today’s sort of knowledge economy."
41IN,41IN_67,Q,How what works?
41IN,41IN_68,A,How teams work.
41IN,41IN_69,Q,"Oh, how teams work. Yeah."
41IN,41IN_7,Q,"Yep. Okay, good. So, look, I'm interviewing you as an institution, as an organisation from that perspective, but you're on a number of boards, aren't you?"
41IN,41IN_70,A,"Teams. Most things in organisations get done by teams these days and teams have to work together, and that means compromise and concessions and whatever."
41IN,41IN_71,Q,"So, now, this sort of moves us in the direction of diversity of - it could be thought of as cognitive diversity or different ways of thinking and how that might be brought together. Do you know what I mean?"
41IN,41IN_72,A,I think I do. Carry on.
41IN,41IN_73,Q,"Well, some people have talked about it being very important, diversity being very important in situations of risk and uncertainty because that's the time when you want diverse perspectives to come together and inform the decision - as you said, have a good conversation. That's when you really need it. So, it becomes critical. So, they’re saying, that's when you most need diversity."
41IN,41IN_74,A,"Well, that might be true, but if a building is burning down, I'm not sure we need to have a discussion about it."
41IN,41IN_75,Q,"[laughs] Yes, true. Oh my god, you sound like a philosopher."
41IN,41IN_76,A,"[unclear] 00:22:59, just to have sensible procedures that have been developed and sensible risk assessments that have been done that in fact do encompass diversity of thought and opinion."
41IN,41IN_77,Q,And do the board have a role in that? Is that something the board does?
41IN,41IN_78,A,"Absolutely. I mean, risk assessment or risk matrices or risk whatever are one of the very key things that boards are expected to pay attention to, because remember, if you're a board member you don't know completely how an organisation works in every detail, but you do bring with you in that board role a range of experiences from other places, and the value you add as a board member is often your understandings of what happens in other places to add value to the board that you're sitting on today, sort of thing. It's your life experiences that you bring. Those are particularly valuable when you think about risk spaces and organisation. And an example the other day that rose in a meeting was that somebody said the top two risks in this organisation are A and B, and clearly they decided that from their perspective as an executive in front of the organisation. And in fact, they sort of made the classic mistake and forgot about the customers in the sense that perhaps there are some more important risks than the ones that have been mentioned up to that point, like safety and customer engagement stuff. So, we as an outsider could appreciate that and add a bit of value. That’s sort of a simple example, but board members potentially have got great value to add from their life experiences, when thinking about, in particular, risk, in my humble opinion."
41IN,41IN_79,Q,"Yeah, that’s a good example. It's really clear."
41IN,41IN_8,A,"I am indeed, yes. Plenty. Do you want to know something about them or not?"
41IN,41IN_80,A,"Yeah. And one of the downsides of things like the banking Royal Commission is to sort of having to put people into boxes a bit and get to the point where there is a list of things you must do and that actually removes the capacity to add in some of the other things. Now, that wasn't the intent of the report, I don't think [unclear] 00:25:35, but that is always the temptation for people to do exactly what they've been told. And similarly, with risk regimes - you might get consumed by the fact that you've got a smart web-based system that manages a compliance and risk management system, and then you forget to ask what else is happening."
41IN,41IN_81,Q,"See, when I think of these major public reviews that shame organisations, so pose reputational risk, culture seems to come up as a problem, and that's a soft issue. You know what I mean? It's about the people stuff, the interactions between people, the values. What role does the board have in that, because that seems to me to be an important part of risk management?"
41IN,41IN_82,A,"Sorry, can I just get you to repeat that, please?"
41IN,41IN_83,Q,"The culture. The culture of an organisation, the culture of a board - do you think that's an important part of diversity or has diversity -"
41IN,41IN_84,A,What culture -
41IN,41IN_85,Q,Yeah.
41IN,41IN_86,A,"My turn - well, I heard someone talk about culture and express, are we doing the right thing by our customers? And this is a financial services enterprise sort of thing. So, clearly the board needs to be conscious of how things are done in the organisation. They need to understand what the priorities are. For example, if you sit on a Qantas aeroplane, they will tell you that safety is our first priority. If you walk around Qantas, I hope when you talk to people and say what's important, they’ll say, well, when we have a choice, it's safety, sort of thing.  If you walk around the financial services institutions, post the Hayne Royal Commission, and you ask them what's important, hopefully they'll say, 'Making sure that we sell the customers things that are fit for purpose for them' type of thing. So, culture is a general term, but I think people need to understand what it means on the ground sort of thing."
41IN,41IN_87,Q,"Yeah, in the organisation."
41IN,41IN_88,A,"That's a very non-culture answer to your question, but it's all gets back to, well, culture; that's the way we do things around here, and then you say, what are the rules? And when I have to make a choice, what is the balance between a and b sort of thing. So, that is clearly something that boards should pay a lot of attention to because they're at the top of the organisation. If they know people - I mean, they should be on the watch for certain sorts of things, and what might those things be? I don't know, but it could be that our IT systems are so out of date that we know very little about our customers. So, we're not servicing them appropriately. It might be that we haven't had any security reviews for quite some time. That might be an issue, et cetera."
41IN,41IN_89,Q,"Okay, so the priorities. Does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others, do you think? And if so, what kind of diversity and why?"
41IN,41IN_9,Q,"Yeah, because we can de-identify it. Yeah, how many boards are you on?"
41IN,41IN_90,A,That's a [unclear] 00:29:29.
41IN,41IN_91,Q,"Well, it has to be to you as in your position - well, in your position as a chair on one of your boards - not the women's one - let's say on the Australian Ethical Superannuation when you were there, what kind of diversity matter most in that position, do you think?"
41IN,41IN_92,A,What kind of diversity?
41IN,41IN_93,Q,Yeah.
41IN,41IN_94,A,"I mean, diversity is a collection of items that you might think about. You've also got to think about what skillsets you need, also think about what experience you've got around the board table from the sector and from outside the sector. You need to obviously think about gender diversity. You might need to think about geographic diversity because it might be that you've got [unclear] 00:30:32 to have lots of people who were very environmentally conscious and they tended to live in environmentally interesting places, which was outside public view, sort of thing. You need to appreciate that. I'm not sure I'm really answering your question, but you just have to think about what's the business we're in or the venture we're in or the cause that we're doing and how can we assemble a collection of those staff and board members who will, in fact, have the insights to develop that business sufficiently."
41IN,41IN_95,Q,That’s excellent. Thank you. That’s a really good way to respond to that question.
41IN,41IN_96,A,"That was a very poor question, let me tell you."
41IN,41IN_97,Q,"No, no, all right. I'll accept it as a poor question, but is it a poor quest if it prompted such a good answer?"
41IN,41IN_98,A,"Indeed. There you go. What do you do at La Trobe University? I've forgotten, actually."
41IN,41IN_99,Q,"I'm in the School of Management Research and in the School of Management, so I teach business ethics -"
4IN,4IN_1,A,Do you know about that?  I think just talk about it.
4IN,4IN_10,Q1,Why does it get difficult?  In what way?
4IN,4IN_100,Q1,So just doesn’t act.
4IN,4IN_101,A,Correct.
4IN,4IN_102,Q1,"So have you ever seen that happen, a board – or are you aware that that’s happened, a board just couldn’t act because they couldn’t come to a decision?"
4IN,4IN_103,A,"I’m sure there’ll be examples among the way.  I just haven’t experienced it, no."
4IN,4IN_104,Q1,"So you don’t know of a case where it happened because of different points of view, different perspectives on something?  No?"
4IN,4IN_105,A,"There’s going to be different perspectives but they’re not gender driven at all, drive by any of the other aspects of diversity then we’re talking about. It’s usually a simple answer, director A wants to d something and director B thinks that would not of interest to the shareholders and opposes."
4IN,4IN_106,Q1,Okay so just competing points of view.
4IN,4IN_107,A,And chances of what’s right and wrong.
4IN,4IN_108,Q1,So how does the chair then resolve that kind of situation?  What do they do with it?
4IN,4IN_109,A,"I can’t – there’s another practice [inaudible] 00:27:22. But the role of the chair is to try to ascertain the view of the meeting and embody that in the form of resolution, which is really the decision of the board."
4IN,4IN_11,A,"[inaudible] 00:04:00 has set a target that 40% of your boards for example, 50% of your boards should be of the female gender how do you do that in the context of thousands of ethnicities?"
4IN,4IN_110,Q1,"Okay.  Well we’ll move on.  I think I’ve exhausted you on that one.  So boards commonly use skills and behaviour matrices – you mentioned this earlier – to assess balance, how useful do you think these tools are?"
4IN,4IN_111,A,I think they’re quite useful.  Any of the [inaudible] 00:28:03 directors to focus their mind to around their current skillset and they’re likely where perhaps they need to think about getting someone to do on the board or replace someone on the board or directors themselves doing some personal hesitations.
4IN,4IN_112,Q2,"So [the participant], if I just can jump in – the use of skills matrices obviously fairly old hat and used fairly regularly and it’s certainly been in the ICD, so training material for a while, and behaviour matrices are talked about but have you – there’s obviously some challenges around that but have you – in your experience have you heard of companies endeavouring to use some behavioural matrices in addition to skill matrices?"
4IN,4IN_113,A,No.
4IN,4IN_114,Q2,"Essentially to work out – work out what are the [inaudible] 00:29:07 some will fit into the behavioural dynamics of the board, etc."
4IN,4IN_115,A,No that issue is hopefully gets dealt with at the recruitment stage.  And if it transpires that the company makes a poor decision in their choice of directors then it’s the job of the chair to sort that out and to suggest to the director in question that they need to lift their game or [inaudible] 00:29:36 find another board position.
4IN,4IN_116,Q1,I was just wondering if the skills of the matrix is that guided by the principles?  Do you specify that in the new principles?
4IN,4IN_117,A,"No it's up to each company to work out what sort of skills they need.  Skills for example the junior explorer which is digging holes in the ground only to find something, it’s very different from say a Coles or a BHP or a major bank."
4IN,4IN_118,Q1,"So that sort of variety is very dependant on the board situation and its strategy, I guess?  Yeah?"
4IN,4IN_119,A,"Yeah, correct.  I actually thought making an overarching observation and [inaudible] 00:30:27 running the discussion around ethnicity [inaudible] 00:30:29 performing there are a highly specialised role and it’s very easy to set some generalities around it would be good to have people with different ethnicity, etc., etc. because it [inaudible] 00:30:47 and so on.  The role they perform at board which is a very specific role required in a very specific set of skills across the board connecting to people to be able to perform that role."
4IN,4IN_12,Q1,So for collation and that it’s difficult to define people from different ethnic backgrounds and group them?  Is that the problem?
4IN,4IN_120,Q1,"Okay.  That’s more mechanistic than I was thinking.  So cultivating diversity well this is the last section now, we’ve got three questions.  More generally how do you think diversity should be increased in Australian boards?"
4IN,4IN_121,A,The [inaudible] 00:31:25 each board [inaudible] 00:31:29 within stretches of our current governance framework.
4IN,4IN_122,Q1,Okay board level.  But you provide a governance framework that says it’s important and you need to report in terms of gender.
4IN,4IN_123,A,Yes.
4IN,4IN_124,Q1,"Okay, do you think even state run boards that – is it too tough a question – too direct a question to ask, do you think it’s good that expectations are made clear that you have X number of women or X number of doctors if it’s a hospital or something like that?   That’s beyond the board."
4IN,4IN_125,A,"Look I think it’s always helpful to be thinking about how you can increase the pool, people that are candidates for roles.  And if you start off a position where you’re not thinking about 50% of the population that’s not [inaudible] 00:32:40."
4IN,4IN_126,Q1,Okay.  So what barriers are there to increasing diversity in Australian company boards do you think?
4IN,4IN_127,A,"There’s still some – I think we’re still seeing some generational issues if I can say that in those terms.  [inaudible] 00:33:03 stale as they’re sometimes referred to.  It wouldn’t necessarily be its opened to views that most people have these days around gender diversity, the same way they wouldn’t be open to views around same sex marriage."
4IN,4IN_128,Q1,So it’s like a culture of a board then?
4IN,4IN_129,A,"Not the board, it’s the [inaudible] 00:33:40 sees its values and views of individuals.  And those views and values tend to differ across generations.  And there are still some of an older generation on boards of directors that would have different views and values."
4IN,4IN_13,A,"Yeah, correct."
4IN,4IN_130,Q1,"Some boards have to – they only have a three year tenure then they have to go, do you support that idea of a limited timeframe?"
4IN,4IN_131,A,"They don’t have to go.  If they’re ASX listed companies to my understanding was that you are subject to re-election every three years.  So in some cases you resign but you have to stand for re-election after every three years.  Some jurisdictions [inaudible] 00:34:34 my trip to the UK, actually have a requirement that everyone stands for re-election after one year not three years."
4IN,4IN_132,Q1,What do you think about that?  It’s short.
4IN,4IN_133,A,I think it’s too short.
4IN,4IN_134,Q2,"I think possibly what Margo was getting at and what I started thinking of in that context was some boards, not necessarily jurisdiction, have caps on the number of terms a director could have, so it could be six years, nine years or whatever.  I’m just interested in whether you think that’s a desirable way to go or not?"
4IN,4IN_135,A,"I think the danger with that approach is if you make it a hard and fast rule you inevitably excluding some people for making a significant contribution to the board.  It’s an area that we do give some guidance on in the principles and recommendations because one of the relevant considerations for a board is independence, being independent from management and independence from too many shareholders who might have a different view than shareholders as a whole have different interests and other investments.  And we’re now toying with the idea of putting in a provision which says that, for example, after three terms, nine years or ten years, which is the other common number that people bandy about.  You should no longer be considered independent."
4IN,4IN_136,A,"We have actually gone so far as principles and recommendations to stress that to the board to determine whether someone has been around theorganisation are no longer a candidate in particular for management.   I mean a great example outside of that, there’s a very well regarded I don’t know director of a – I won’t name him – of a very large and significant Australian mining company who’s been on the board for the past 20 years who I think all investors would say he’s done a brilliant job as a director and they would rather have him on the board than not."
4IN,4IN_137,Q1,But do you think if someone’s on the board for that long that there’s then the risk of what you were talking about of the generational affect: the culture of against gender diversity for example?
4IN,4IN_138,A,"The answer to that is say well what’s the – what’s the counter proposition?  That everyone should be sacked after a period of time?  I don’t think that’s right.  But you see that in particular the chairman of the board needs to be sensitive to and understand and to work out as part of their succession planning when the director can come off the board, are they stale, are they too closely connected with management and not providing a critical assessment?"
4IN,4IN_139,Q1,That’s good.  I’ll look closely at the succession planning principles in the – good.  Well that’s – we’re really -
4IN,4IN_14,Q1,Right.
4IN,4IN_140,Q2,Can I just jump in.
4IN,4IN_141,Q1,Please do.
4IN,4IN_142,Q2,"Just one more question [the participant] before we wrap it up.  You’ve talked, understandably, a lot about the governance principles that applies to the listed companies, I’d just like your thoughts – this is actually not in our script but I’d just like your thoughts on what impact you think – let’s just speak gender because you talked about that and there’s a specific prescription – things like the targets and the suggestions and the please explain that it takes place with listed companies to what extent you think it influences the SMEs and unlisted entities?"
4IN,4IN_143,A,You’re talking about a different scale of operation there.
4IN,4IN_144,Q2,Sure.
4IN,4IN_145,A,So for all what’s appropriate for a listed company might not certainly going to be appropriate for a plumber or an electrician.
4IN,4IN_146,Q2,"But I’m just trying to ascertain whether you think it could be influential, a medium sized enterprise might say these are the behaviours at the big end of town for using that expression, maybe that’s something we need to be looking at as well."
4IN,4IN_147,A,"Look I think coming back to that point about with maximising the pool or the talent that you can recruit if you’re ignoring people from particular genders or ethnicities you’re obviously diminishing the pool of available talents to recruit.  So there’s something for everyone in that but I don’t think you can say because listed companies attack that issue in the way that we are through the governance principles that shouldn’t mean that the should be applied elsewhere.  That said, there are three other larger organisations that look for the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations for listed companies for providing guidance on good governance practice.  And they're often picked up by for example government organisations where not-for-profits and in some case large charities as the benchmark for testing their governance frameworks against."
4IN,4IN_148,Q1,"Good.  Okay, great.  So -"
4IN,4IN_149,A,What might be appropriate for the listed company might not be appropriate for the local club or an electrician.
4IN,4IN_15,A,"And if you start dividing them into categories, ethnicities, you end up working between hundreds of categories and the whole process becomes meaningless."
4IN,4IN_150,Q1,Okay so do you have any other thoughts to share on board diversity and on how this diversity should be managed?
4IN,4IN_151,A,"Look I don’t know, maybe the observation I made before, boards perform a very specific role within an organisation and need some – need the appropriate level of skills to perform that role.  As I said before there are plenty of 18 year olds out there who think they should be entitled to be on the board of a listed company but the reality is they don’t have the skills and experience to do so."
4IN,4IN_152,Q1,That’s excellent. Thank you.  That’s a great line to finish on.  Thank you so much [the participant].
4IN,4IN_153,Q2,Thanks very much [the participant].
4IN,4IN_154,A,Good luck.
4IN,4IN_155,Q1,Okay bye bye.
4IN,4IN_156,A,Bye.
4IN,4IN_157,Q1,That was good.
4IN,4IN_158,Q2,That was excellent.
4IN,4IN_16,Q1,"Okay, good point.  Does that go for age and socio-economic background?"
4IN,4IN_17,A,"To a lesser degree.  I actually – the primary focus is the diversity recommendations at the board level.  While there may be plenty of 18 year olds out in the community who think they’re qualified to be directors of listed companies, but reality is they're not."
4IN,4IN_18,Q1,"Do the – does the reporting targets, expectations differ between the different ASIC 100, ASIC 200, ASIC 300?"
4IN,4IN_19,A,I think you mean ASX.
4IN,4IN_2,Q1,No if you could talk about it that would be really good.  Thanks [the participant].
4IN,4IN_20,Q1,"ASX, sorry.  ASX, yep."
4IN,4IN_21,A,"No, that’s alright.  No."
4IN,4IN_22,Q1,It doesn’t so it’s across.
4IN,4IN_23,A,"Wherever possible within the rules we try to have one set of standards apply to all listed companies.  Now that said it’s proposed then in the fourth edition to make an exception to that general rule and we consulted on the proposition in the fourth edition which, without giving any secrets away, is pretty much soon to be in the fourth – final register of the fourth edition issued that the genders address the targets for the boards to have not less than 30% of each gender on board."
4IN,4IN_24,Q1,And what happens if people don’t meet that target?  What’s the enforcement?
4IN,4IN_25,A,"It’s not a legislative provision, it’s a recommendation in a governance code that listed companies are required to report against all, if not one on basis.  So by that I mean that if you don’t meet the recommendations you have to state that fact in your annual corporate governance statement and it’s like why you don’t meet a recommendation.  So that gives listed companies the flexibility for example to say we’re in this – for example we’re in this niche specialist area where it’s difficult to get women [inaudible] 00:07:10, specialisation of directors onboards, blah, blah, blah or men for that matter.  And to explain why if they’re not meeting that that recommendation - so it’s not a hard rule of law it’s a recommendation that could be explained away as it were through that if not why not disclosure requirement."
4IN,4IN_26,Q1,"And who reads these reports, investors or?"
4IN,4IN_27,A,Yes.  Well they have a wider circulation than that.  With the governance disclosures are either contained on the company’s website or in its annual report.  So anyone who has the chance to pick up an annual report or open a company’s website to find these disclosures.
4IN,4IN_28,Q1,And do you think it has – makes a difference say to superannuation funds or big investors like that?
4IN,4IN_29,A,It most certainly does.  The level of female participation in the ASX 200 at board level’s gone from around 5% at the time the recommendations were first introduced to actually being close to 30% now.  So it’s had a dramatic impact since they were introduced in 2010.
4IN,4IN_3,A,ASX and the Corporate Governance Council’s taking – has taken a fairly leading position ongender diversity on all listed company.  That started with an amendment to the then second edition of the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations in 2010 to add gender diversity recommendations.  As such those recommendations was that a board should have a diversity policy which should set measurable objectives for keeping gender diversity and it should report against those objectives on annual basis.  That recommendation was typed in the third edition that was issued 2014 and is about to be further typed in the fourth edition which God willing will come out this month – sorry not this month in February.  But the substance remains the same that boards should be setting [inaudible] 00:01:17 diversity policy setting diversity targets with their organisation and report against the achievement of those targets on an annual basis.
4IN,4IN_30,Q1,That’s a very quick change.
4IN,4IN_31,A,"Yes needless to say it’s starting to slow a little bit.  But you could see the – the intent is actually came into effect with the way listed companies – particularly the larger listed companies – is modelled because it’s the large listed companies, that institutional investors are the primary investors and who pull sway with boards and who do regard these domestic issues as significant, particularly gender diversity."
4IN,4IN_32,Q1,Right.  And do you think that importance is because of their concerns about impacts – the influence of investors or do you think they think it’s important as intrinsically so?
4IN,4IN_33,A,A little from column A and a little from column B.
4IN,4IN_34,Q1,"Good answer.  Okay the intrinsic side: can you tell me how they think it’s important, like why?"
4IN,4IN_35,A,Yeah well there are some strange little [inaudible] 00:09:38 that I've referenced in the principles and recommendations that suggests that boards reach better – a better ratio of male and female representation tend to perform better than companies that don’t have a balanced gender diversity.
4IN,4IN_36,Q1,And do you find that a persuasive argument?  Is that your personal position as well?
4IN,4IN_37,A,"I aggressively agree with that, yeah.  If you think about [phone ringing] – excuse me – sorry one second."
4IN,4IN_38,Q1,That’s fine.
4IN,4IN_39,A,Probably talking on the computer the phone’s free.  Where was I?
4IN,4IN_4,Q2,"So [the participant] if I can just probe that a bit.  So you focussed on gender diversity and I understand that - and the stance that come through over the years through the governance principles, but are there any other aspects of diversity that come to mind that you think are important?"
4IN,4IN_40,Q1,Why you think it’s important.
4IN,4IN_41,A,"If you think about what likely to drive that decision that hands – the type of people who are likely to make that decision around carrying a more diverse – gender diverse board it kind of stands to reason that they’re more likely than not to be more forward thinking rather than lie in the past and probably more closely connected to the investors and their customers and aligning in terms of the values that their investors and customers have and you would expect the companies that are more reliant to the interest of their investors and their customers, they’re going to have to perform better than ones that are not."
4IN,4IN_42,Q1,Okay so it’s a really – it’s a signifier of a more functional board rather than the gender diversity creates it?
4IN,4IN_43,A,Correct.
4IN,4IN_44,Q1,That’s an interesting -
4IN,4IN_45,A,[overtalk] 00:11:49 there’s no longer a board who are making the decisions as to who will replace it eventually.  More attuned to those types of issues.
4IN,4IN_46,Q1,Okay so the causal story is still a bit – we’ll leave that aside for a while will we or do you have a sense of how diversity might influence or benefit a board apart from just being a sign of a more forward thinking board?
4IN,4IN_47,A,"Well as I say there are studies out there, financial and market studies, that suggest that companies with better diverse – better representation by genders on the board tend to perform better than those who don’t have that."
4IN,4IN_48,Q1,But how it works is a bit vague.  It’s a bit of a black box.
4IN,4IN_49,A,"It’s not so much a black box, as I said before if you think about what they are meaning about the type of people on a board it means they are more likely to be attuned to [inaudible] 00:12:52 if I can use that expression."
4IN,4IN_5,A,"That’s an issue that there’s a little bit of guidance on in the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations.  If you have a look at Recommendation 1.5 of the existing third edition you will see there’s a reference in there to it being desirable with the diversity policies that the board sets for the organisations should cover more than just gender diversity.  But the Council’s recommendation is to specifically focus on gender diversity because for the obvious reasons 50% of our community, slightly more than 50% of the community is of the female gender and therefore the female representation on boards was historically nowhere near that figure of course."
4IN,4IN_50,Q1,Okay.
4IN,4IN_51,A,It’s more likely to have voted yes in same sex marriage is pretty random.
4IN,4IN_52,Q1,"I understand.  Okay, do you feel that board diversity can negatively impact?  So do you think it can negatively impact a board’s decision making performance?"
4IN,4IN_53,A,"Not in and of itself however if you appoint someone to a board just because they happen to be male or female without regard to whether they have the skills or capabilities and the experience to people [inaudible] 00:13:28 then that’s likely to lead to less than optimal outcomes.  So people who appoint female directors for the sake of just getting their numbers up without actually thinking about whether the female director they’re appointing is the right person for the role, you can see how that would cause issues."
4IN,4IN_54,Q1,"Yeah, definitely.  If it was seen to and if it in fact was, yeah.  What about other kinds of diversity though: social, ethnicity, skills, mix, what about those kinds of diversity?  Do you think they might negatively impact board performance?"
4IN,4IN_55,A,"Potentially yeah.  It really depends on which accent to suit.  If you’re talking about skills generally you want to have a board that’s got a really full mix of skills carrying off things like obviously accounting and financial issues, some sort of skills and experience in the history of which the company’s operating, legal skills, people skills.  You want to have – in fact one of the recommendations in the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations is that boards should have a skills matrix and have regard to that skills matrix when they’re making their determinations around rotation of directors and replacing of directors."
4IN,4IN_56,Q1,"Good.  We have a question about that later on, I might come back to that then.  But let’s move now to the process, could you explain to me how your organisation might seek to influence boards and in particular the priority that they might give to diversity?  And I think you’ve really identified one way."
4IN,4IN_57,A,Yeah I’ve pretty much answered that.
4IN,4IN_58,Q1,Yeah with your recommendation.
4IN,4IN_59,A,[overtalk] 00:15:30 through leadership roles displayed on the ASX Corp Governance Council and that also in its own – ASX obviously sees itself as the exemplar for good corporate governance and it would be [bad] 00:15:49 if it weren't.  So our board takes the issue of gender diversity fairly seriously.  We have for quite some time now have a third of our directors as women – more than a third.
4IN,4IN_6,A,"Now there’s a reference to the other types of – I’ll just pull out my copy of the third edition – just bear with me for one second while I find the relevant passage.  There’s a reference in the statistics and the content of the Diversity Policy in box 1.5: “Organisations should recognise that diversity not only includes gender diversity but also includes matters of age, disability, ethnicity, marital and family status, religious or cultural backgrounds, sexual orientation and gender identity”."
4IN,4IN_60,Q1,So you’re role modelling?
4IN,4IN_61,A,"Yeah, correct."
4IN,4IN_62,Q1,Okay.
4IN,4IN_63,A,"Plus, we do a lot of [inaudible] 00:16:14 we were recognised through an Employer of Choice Awards for some of the efforts that we’ve made in terms of gender related HR issues, the maternity leave and flexible working arrangements, etc., etc."
4IN,4IN_64,Q1,Okay so the role model and the guidelines.  That’s great.  Good.  So regarding selection how do you think new board members should be selected?
4IN,4IN_65,A,For large listed companies they would normally have a nomination committee and the nomination committee would suitably determine where there is or what lies being a gap because for example a director’s retiring or – and they would the suitably through the CEO engage a head hunting firm to find a replacement.  That’s the way it should be done.
4IN,4IN_66,Q1,And your – the guidelines that you’ve produced do they guide this process?  Do they have a focus on selection and board – well board composition they do but selection process?
4IN,4IN_67,A,"Yes, there is some guidance around having a nomination committee or if you don’t – if you’re not a large company we warrant having a nomination committee at least disclosing what your processes are around addressing board succession issues.  So it’s very much the disclosure approach is similar to the approach taken with diversity."
4IN,4IN_68,Q1,And does your organisation – thank you for that – does your organisation do anything to cultivate board candidates?
4IN,4IN_69,A,I think pretty much every organisation does that just through the product and development selection and development in its senior executives’ team.
4IN,4IN_7,Q2,Yep.
4IN,4IN_70,Q1,Okay so do you – do you think about diversity then when you’re promoting people within your organisation?
4IN,4IN_71,A,"Yes, we do.  For example, because we perform a [inaudible] 00:18:45 in every position that we interview for that there be at least one female candidates and the instructions to look into our [inaudible] 00:18:53."
4IN,4IN_72,Q1,"Okay, perfect.  And that award that you mentioned that really is evidence of that within your organisation?"
4IN,4IN_73,A,Yeah.
4IN,4IN_74,Q1,Good.  Can you think of any ways that your organisation helps candidates from minority groups to become attractive board candidates?  Maybe from a low socio-economic background or something like that?
4IN,4IN_75,A,"Yeah, look I keep talking about how the candidates of boards from a low socio-economic backgrounds doesn’t make a huge amount of sense to me.  But you need a certain skill level to be on the board of a listed company.  If you don’t have the education and experience that you should have skill level, you shouldn’t be on a board.  These aren’t instruments representing the populous, so we’ve had some politicians, these are people who are running listed companies with serious businesses, so you need to have a set of skills to do that."
4IN,4IN_76,Q1,"Look that’s really interesting.  Could you – that comparison between governance represented democracy versus the governance of a board, could you flesh that out a little more?"
4IN,4IN_77,A,"As I said it’s you can’t think of the boards of companies in the same way it would seem for example that parliament should be presentative of the community.  The board is there to do a function, it’s not there to represent us, the community.  It’s there to make money for shareholders."
4IN,4IN_78,Q1,Okay.  So corporate social responsibility and things like that is that -?
4IN,4IN_79,A,"Yes, I mean consistent for making money for shareholders because the companies that are a good brand tend to make more money and part of having a good brand is the role interplay in the company."
4IN,4IN_8,Q1,Great.
4IN,4IN_80,Q1,Okay.  Have you any – no.  What do you understand by cognitive diversity?  There’s a lot of discussion about this.
4IN,4IN_81,A,Look I understand the concept.  It’s being aware of – aware of again more currency in academia and the like.
4IN,4IN_82,Q1,"So if we think about it as different approaches to problem solving do you think these measurable factors like gender, ethnicity, social, age diversity are good predictors of different ways of problem solving?"
4IN,4IN_83,A,I don’t think you can draw that connection necessarily.
4IN,4IN_84,Q1,So do you think cognitive diversity or different approaches to problem solving is useful for boards?
4IN,4IN_85,A,"Absolutely.  But again, it comes back to the point that a board isn’t there to represent unity, a board is there to do a function for investors and it requires a certain set of skills.  Yes, it’s nice to have a group to have a very mix of skills, gender, etc., across the board and that would likely to be helpful in achieving possible outcomes for the company and its shareholders, but I don’t think you can say for that you should definitely have people from 15 different ethnic backgrounds because that helps you gives more diversity in how the board thinks.  I don’t think [inaudible] 00:23:02."
4IN,4IN_86,Q1,"Good.  So if we disconnect now cognitive diversity from the demographic type of diversity, if we just think of different approaches to problem solving, do you think that that is an important factors for boards that people have different ways to look at information and solve problems?"
4IN,4IN_87,A,Of course.  Of course.  But because you also have to get to an outcome where - boards operate by resolution and you have to get to an outcome where the board is supportive of the decision which makes everyone has to be brought along [inaudible] 00:23:50 majority of the people have to be [inaudible] 00:23:51 along with the decision.
4IN,4IN_88,Q1,And do you think there’s a risk that if there’s too much diversity?
4IN,4IN_89,A,Well this again you are focussing on concepts like cognitive diversity and starting from an assumption that [inaudible] 00:24:13 looking at things necessarily leads to better decisions.
4IN,4IN_9,A,"Now we understand we don’t require boards to set measurable objectives and before against those objectives for any criteria of diversity other than gender diversity.  The fact that if you start talking about, for example, ethnicity that gets very, very difficult."
4IN,4IN_90,Q1,So you think they don’t or?  I’m just -
4IN,4IN_91,A,I think there’s a wall of division of terms there.
4IN,4IN_92,Q1,Can you unpack it a little for us?
4IN,4IN_93,A,"I [inaudible] 00:24:33 in the work that I do it’s always helpful to have a second, and sometimes a third and fourth set of eyes working at something.  So once you set a task, probably three or four sets of eyes, the law of division in terms of conent comes in, the way that [inaudible] 00:24:54."
4IN,4IN_94,Q1,"That’s good.  That’s a good analogy.  Sodo you – who – what – we’ve heard people talk about “the chair”, the role of the chair as being key in managing this."
4IN,4IN_95,A,"Yeah, absolutely.  The role of the chair is to discover the consensus among directors and all agree to a resolution."
4IN,4IN_96,Q1,Right.  And are there any – in these principles are there any guidance for the chair in this role?
4IN,4IN_97,A,Nothing that I can think of specifically.  There is a general [inaudible] 00:25:35 and the chair is seeing recommendations [inaudible] 00:25:43 is a fairly high level.
4IN,4IN_98,Q1,"And if boards can’t decide – let’s say there’s an information – if there’s a decision breakdown what happens then because of diversity or different views, people can’t agree?"
4IN,4IN_99,A,Board can only act on resolution.
5D,5D_1,Q1,Okay.
5D,5D_10,A,Do you want me to turn this off if we're confidential?
5D,5D_100,A,No.
5D,5D_101,Q2,"Surely someone who didn't have those basics, if you like, wouldn't make the cut to get on the board?"
5D,5D_102,Q1,Be a good fit. It would be seen as not a fit.
5D,5D_103,A,"It would be as cultural fit, you'd be like, oh, they're not a good cultural fit."
5D,5D_104,Q2,Right.
5D,5D_105,A,"And no one, I think a lot of this is that unconscious stuff, you wouldn't actually be aware that that was why it didn't feel like a good fit. Now, again, this is a very, it's an extreme example, because there would be very few people who didn't know how to sit at a dinner table who would be going for board positions, but, you know, it's that kind of stuff of if you have had a more informal board experience versus a super formal board experience, or what you're expecting, or how it's been explained why you're there. So, if you're appointed versus elected - yeah."
5D,5D_106,Q1,"I'm just thinking about, when we get to cultivation whether we can talk a little bit more about the 'fit' idea. Some research suggests that boards should consider cognitive diversity, which is - how do you understand cognitive diversity?"
5D,5D_107,A,"So, again, the best way I can describe it is on - I think one of the reasons that academics are getting more involved in boards is that we think differently. Everyone says you have to have a lawyer and you have to have an accountant, and they think - not they, but the layperson, when you say that, they think it's because you need them to do legal stuff or numbers stuff, that [inaudible] 00:29:15. That's not what they're doing. The lawyer on the board is not doing the legal legwork, and the accountant on the board is not doing the books, but we think differently. So, my skill set on our board is my breadth of knowledge about sport, not that sport, but sport in general, my breadth of knowledge and depth of knowledge on governance process, policy, practice, but also, academics brains work differently. We look for more meta, bigger, [inaudible] 00:29:45 you know, that kind of stuff."
5D,5D_108,A,"So, I'm like, okay, well, I think we're going over in this direction, whereas my banker is very granular in the details of the financials, and my lawyer is all about risk. He's a litigation lawyer, so, it's about - and I'm on a number of boards now where I'm watching people who are Directors for a living, so, they are professional Directors, and we had a talk about how you get through all the papers, and one who I expect a lot, she's on lots of big government infrastructure boards, so, very high level, she says that she skims everything, and then the stuff that she knows is her sweet spot, she goes deep, because that's where she can contribute best. I think if everyone's the same expertise in depth then you're going to miss all the other stuff."
5D,5D_109,Q1,Okay. That's good.
5D,5D_11,Q2,"No, no, it can be fine. It can be fine. Apart from Tennis Australia, you've been on some other boards over the years as well, right?"
5D,5D_110,A,"So, if you only have lawyers, it's not going to work."
5D,5D_111,Q1,"Yeah. Now, do you think it [overtalk] 00:30:43 -"
5D,5D_112,A,It doesn't [overtalk] 00:30:43.
5D,5D_113,Q2,[overtalk] 00:30:44.
5D,5D_114,A,"Yes. Sorry, lawyers."
5D,5D_115,Q1,"Do you think that any of these demographic diversity factors like gender, ethnicity, social background, age, are a good predictor of cognitive diversity, or -"
5D,5D_116,A,I think it's a different lived experience.
5D,5D_117,Q1,Okay. Lived experience.
5D,5D_118,A,"Karen will appreciate that one, I think. So, I am not pretending that I am from an - you know, I'm very well up, we are officially as well educated as you can get, so, tick, middle class background, tick, multi generations of university, tick, speak English, white. So, realistically, my only point of diversity is my gender. But I am a Mum, so I have a very - and I've also been brought up politically within a very left-wing family, so I have, I look at the world through a strong social justice lens. So that is, the diversity of my thought is my day job has a way of thinking, but also my family, and personally I have a - my paradigm is left."
5D,5D_119,A,"That's what I think the Royal Commission came out of, you know, that they'd forgotten about people and just focused on return. I think sometimes that diversity of thought, if you have diversity of lived experience, you'll get more of that. You'll get someone who goes, oh, that's going to really hurt the workers, or that's going to really impact on that particular part of the community, or if we do that, then these people are never going to get a job, whereas if everyone only think that same way, if you're only chasing bottom line then you're going to make [inaudible] 00:32:35 decisions."
5D,5D_12,A,"Yep. So, The board of a peak sporting organisation was my first one, which is like a faux statutory authority. It's effectively a lobby group, like Sailing Australia or something like that, but it's the advocacy group for the whole of sport in Victoria, so, I was on that board for seven years. National peak sporting organisation, I have been on, I'm just starting my second third year term, so I was reappointed in October. I took up the Presidency of that, because it's a board appointed Chair, early last year, so I'm [overtalk] 00:01:30 -"
5D,5D_120,Q2,"But, again, what you said about academics is interesting, because any self-respecting accounting or finance academic would have said, if you set the incentives to where you have, you're going to have these progress outcomes."
5D,5D_121,A,Absolutely.
5D,5D_122,Q2,"There's tons of research on that, which they wouldn't necessarily be aware of. It's common sense, it [inaudible] 00:32:43, it's not - yeah."
5D,5D_123,A,"Yeah, absolutely. So, I think that's where it's about the diversity of thought, and how your sociodemographic diversity plays into that is your lived experience frames how you see the world. So, if you've come from - you might be a hard-arsed litigation lawyer, but you might have come from a refugee family. Now, you might not have been the refugee, your parents might have been, but that shapes how you understand the world. So, I think that's where that visible diversity comes into play."
5D,5D_124,Q1,"Yeah, okay. So, cognitive diversity is this process, that's what you understand it to be?"
5D,5D_125,A,Yep.
5D,5D_126,Q1,"Yeah, good, so it's - right, it looks like a good model there."
5D,5D_127,Q2,"Probing a bit further though, how do you differentiate cognitive diversity from diversity of thought?"
5D,5D_128,Q1,I'd say there was [inaudible] 00:33:39.
5D,5D_129,A,"You can't. You can't separate - you know, we're not a lab rat, we can't separate our experience from how we think. I just think that our - so, that's where your lived experience is who you are and how you see the world, your diversity of thought is how your brain's been trained. So, our brains as academics have been trained to look for problems and solve them, lawyers look for more tight - you know, it's the training of the same brain, but the brain has come through a much longer process in that training."
5D,5D_13,Q1,Great.
5D,5D_130,Q1,"Good. Okay, so, values play a role in that lived experience, because that's really - so it's like, where values and then a cognitive process, or a rational process comes to. Okay. Does your board consider ways to increase the board's cognitive diversity? Is that something that you think of?"
5D,5D_131,A,"Yeah, so, we do have a nominations committee process, and we have a very good, probably too detailed, skills matrix, and we are very aware of requiring different perspectives, to the point where, traditionally sport boards have always been just from the sport, whereas now we've recognised that we needed, in our previous election, we needed someone from more hard core tennis, because we had a great skill mix and a great set of Directors, but we didn't have anyone who lived and breathed it. So, I think that that's where you, you know, you need to look at what your skills matrix is. It's also an experience matrix as much as skills, particularly for a sector like mine, but I imagine the arts wouldn't be terribly different. It would be a pretty weird arts school that didn't have some sort of artist engagement."
5D,5D_132,Q1,Exactly.
5D,5D_133,A,"So, yeah, I think that's key of that."
5D,5D_134,Q1,"Yeah. Could we see - is that a confidential document, the skills matrix?"
5D,5D_135,A,"No, I'm happy to share it."
5D,5D_136,Q1,"Would you? Oh, that would be great."
5D,5D_137,Q1,"We're actually a case study, so, National peak sporting organisation, the Change Our Game program is a Victorian government initiative to get 50% of gender equity on the sport boards. National peak sporting organisation's governance reform to get us where we are now, it's a case study, so most of what you're asking about that process and the skills matrix is probably available."
5D,5D_138,Q1,Okay. Have you written something on this?
5D,5D_139,A,"Not academically, no. It's a government paper, but I'm happy to point you in the right direction."
5D,5D_14,A,"- my first year as Chair, and that role gives me a seat as a trustee on the Melbourne and Olympic Park Trust. So, the Trust has got predominantly independent, but there's two from Tennis Australia and one from National peak sporting organisation, because it's a tennis precinct. It was set up that way to make sure that the sport of which the whole thing was designed for is still represented. So, I've got not for profit and government, and my PT's, they're statutory, so they're government trust."
5D,5D_140,Q1,Great. Okay.
5D,5D_141,A,"We don't research it anymore, we just do it now."
5D,5D_142,Q1,"Good. Boards [inaudible] 00:36:00 - so, you're going to send that to us?"
5D,5D_143,A,Yep.
5D,5D_144,Q1,"So, all things being equal, in this scenario where you've one board vacancy - one's coming up, isn't it, do you know?"
5D,5D_145,A,"Yes, we've got a - people retiring."
5D,5D_146,Q1,"Would you prefer this vacancy to be filled by a candidate who increases a particular kind of demographic diversity, or cognitive diversity, as your lived experience?"
5D,5D_147,A,"I think, to be honest, the only demographic we're missing is a person with a disability, and that then really depends on where you draw the boundary, because I have a spinal cord injury, it just doesn't - you know."
5D,5D_148,Q2,[inaudible] 00:36:30. Sorry.
5D,5D_149,A,"I don't tick it, but I don't visibly look disabled, so again, I think it's that thing about whether people are visibly -"
5D,5D_15,Q1,"Great, and Chair experience."
5D,5D_150,Q1,Yeah.
5D,5D_151,A,"Do we want, we want someone to wheel me in? I'm like, well, that's stupid. Intellectual disability would be lovely but that's not going to fly. [inaudible] 00:36:47 would be interesting, because you could have high-performing, you know - so, you've kind of also got to think about that person's engagement, but that being said, if Dylan Alcott wanted to come on our board as a Victorian, we would absolutely have him go through that process and put him out to the members and he would get elected, because he is very well connected, he's been a champion of the sport, he's demonstrated through his off-court stuff that he wants to contribute back, he's got skills, et cetera, et cetera. So, he meets all the other criteria. The fact that he's in a wheelchair is just part of it. Same as Daniela, I know that before, we've considered Daniela before as part of our nom-comm process, not because she's in a wheelchair but because she's a really good advocate for the sport and she's smart and she's got, you know, that kind of stuff. It can't be just that they find someone in a wheelchair."
5D,5D_152,Q1,"But I'm thinking about what you said before, the being in a wheelchair, being tied to a wheelchair that way, and then being passionate about the sport, that's a lived experience, so that's quite unique."
5D,5D_153,A,"So, we wouldn't have - I suppose, we wouldn't have it as a specific inclusion, we have to find someone in a wheelchair, it would not be a consideration of why they shouldn't, and it would be -"
5D,5D_154,Q1,"Yeah, don't exclude."
5D,5D_155,A,"Yeah, it would be absolutely non-exclusion. Now, the gender thing was different because we had none, so there's a moment about being representative of the community, plus a stick from the government, so I think that that's probably a different - if you're trying to get broader representation, then you still, probably, on a nine person board, wouldn't get a person in a wheelchair, if you looked at percentage of population. So, I think that's where it gets contrived. The gender thing I think people can cope with, because, like, we're officially excluding half of your potential candidates, but when you start getting smaller populations it starts to get contrived."
5D,5D_156,Q1,"Okay. That would be the largest demographic wouldn't it, split, the gender. I mean, there wouldn't be anything like it [overtalk] 00:38:58."
5D,5D_157,A,"But I mean, again, imagine you had a board, I'm getting all academic now, but you had a board of eight white old guys, and then you had one wheelchair bound person of colour who was a lesbian, does that mean you get bonus? Like, do they count for three? Well, no, they're still only one person, so, that's what I'm saying, you can't have that 'collect them all' set approach. What you want to do, though, is similar to the work that's been done in getting women on boards, is not to say, I can't find anyone. So, when you're going through your list of potential people who could be on your board, and you're going out into the community to have a look, that, the fact that people in wheelchairs are on our radar. Now, they may not be - they may not want to, they may not be the right person, all that kind of stuff, but we're not just looking at people like us."
5D,5D_158,Q1,"Yep, so, you're sensitised to looking for difference, but you won't go tapping every person [overtalk] 00:39:54."
5D,5D_159,A,"Not prescriptively, no."
5D,5D_16,A,yes.
5D,5D_160,Q1,"Okay. Because, I was thinking, in terms of cultivating diverse options, would you, say, give scholarships to -?"
5D,5D_161,A,"Oh, yeah, so, in our [inaudible] 00:40:08 the products we offer as an organisation, absolutely! We have multicultural programs, we have disability programs, we have -"
5D,5D_162,Q1,"But, with the intention of getting them on boards they don't?"
5D,5D_163,A,"No, so, there's a difference between working on access and inclusion through your organisation, not necessarily - but again, you've got nine people. So -but not to the exclusion [inaudible] 00:40:30, so, I think, you're going out to community, and I think it would be one of those decisions where if you had two or three candidates up for an appointed position, and one of them was in a wheelchair or one of them was from an African refugee background, you go with, why not? Let's maybe lean in that decision-making process, but you want to get them in the process. I don't believe in - I do believe in quotas, I don't believe in that collection of specific target groups."
5D,5D_164,Q1,[overtalk] 00:41:01.
5D,5D_165,A,Yes.
5D,5D_166,Q1,Okay.
5D,5D_167,A,"Because, I mean, if you went for a person of colour, how dark do you have to be, you know? Is it -"
5D,5D_168,Q1,Yeah. What if they don't identify with being of colour or -?
5D,5D_169,A,"It's, a lot of it gets contrived. Like, how disabled to you have to be? You guys that have got glasses, do you count?"
5D,5D_17,Q1,"That will be very useful, yeah. Great. Okay, well, thanks [the participant], for agreeing to participate in the research this way. As you know, there's lots of talk about board diversity, but we're particularly interested in hearing from people that actually sit on boards, and so let's start by hearing what board diversity means to you?"
5D,5D_170,Q1,"Yeah. So, you're really blowing our little thing here, so - that's okay, I'll move on to the next question."
5D,5D_171,A,"This is why you [overtalk] 00:41:32, because that's how [overtalk] 00:41:33."
5D,5D_172,Q1,"That's right. That's exactly right, yeah. I guess there is a route, what we're looking for here is, is there a connection between the kind of diversity and the organisation's strategic direction? You know, if you're moving to China, so you're opening business in China, would you look for someone from a Chinese background? If you're moving into a consumer goods business, and its products that target women, would you look for a woman, a female? Would you - so -?"
5D,5D_173,A,"See, I see that as operational."
5D,5D_174,Q1,You see that as operational?
5D,5D_175,A,"So, if I was - for my board, sure, we probably would. So, I know that the diversity inclusion team in my organisation were very excited when I became President, because they went, okay, well, now there's someone with a very clear lens on what we want to do, we might get some more attention. So, that - that's [inaudible] 00:42:32, we can get some more attention, but my job is not to say which market we're going into and [how we went in it]. 00:42:39 You won't be [inaudible] 00:42:44 contracts, you'd be, at that level that you're talking about, you'd be appointing staff to do that, or contractors or engagement. The reason I say that, and I can only talk about what's in the public domain, is our national body is currently under an ASIC investigation because our, a Director who was extraordinarily engaged in the media buying has been accused of stuffing up media buying by, basically, insider trading."
5D,5D_176,A,"So, that person was recruited to the board because of that influence and engagement with the industry, and now they're under investigation by ASIC because they effectively manipulated the bidding process. So, I think there's a huge risk in requiring Directors to get below that. Operational separation is there for a reason."
5D,5D_177,Q2,"[inaudible] 00:43:32 to do with the operational separation [inaudible] 00:43:34 kind of level, but I guess [inaudible] 00:43:42 we're taking, or Margo was getting at, was, let's say, and this [inaudible] 00:43:47, but let's say, a commercial organisation, entirely Australian, and it's now looking for potentially risky, expensive, great opportunities, it's found something in Indonesia, China, or whatever, the question is, would it not be - would it be important or would it not be important to have someone who understands that market? So, it's really for the, should we really be going in, who are the sort of contacts I can introduce my people to -?"
5D,5D_178,A,"Yep, so I'll give you two comments on that."
5D,5D_179,Q2,Yeah.
5D,5D_18,A,"Sure. So, I mean, that being - so, caveat, I am a governance academic, and I did my PhD in it, so I'll probably give you an academic answer. It's really diversity of thought. I think we first of all think of it as diversity of the look and feel of the board, which is obviously a key part, particularly in that idea of you can't be what you can't see. So, I think there needs to be a visual representation of that board diversity, but really what we're looking for is less about the having the full house of different colours and genders and abilities, but more about having diversity of thought in the board room."
5D,5D_180,A,"One would be, how do you know you've got the right Indonesian? So, you've got a risk there if you choose the wrong camp. The second one is, if you really do think you need that skill set in the boardroom where you're discussing the strategy you can co-opt. So, I think we have mechanisms in governance which allow us to bring that expertise in for specific discussions or decisions, but I think that's a perfect example for a co-opted member to come in, to lead through that particular decision. You would only head hunt them if you could then, if they were adding value to the entire business. I'd be uncomfortable having a Director coming in just to focus on one specific piece of the business or one decision."
5D,5D_181,A,"If they've got everything else you're looking for and that, then sure, but if it's really just, we need someone to help us move into Indonesia, then co-opt someone from that background and then release them again when that's done. I do think there is still inherent risk of, how do you know you've got the - if you're putting all your eggs in that person, all of the power on that person to help you make the call, you'd want to make sure that they were the right person. Because the board would be really relying on them to guide the board through, they're effectively - potentially, kind of letting go of all the [inaudible] 00:45:49."
5D,5D_182,Q2,"I'm conscious of time, but I want to challenge that, because I think the board would be pretty [inaudible] 00:45:54case, you know? The fact that you're accountant does not mean that you have no, et cetera, et cetera, so - but your point about picking the right person [inaudible] 00:46:05 places, someone who's incredibly important for you to make [their minds] 00:46:09 up, can be dangerous, because if there's a change [inaudible] 00:46:13."
5D,5D_183,A,"Correct. So, if you choose someone and then there's a coup -"
5D,5D_184,Q2,"Oh, yes."
5D,5D_185,A,"And honestly, I'm - you know, so I think that there's times and places for co-opted, and I think, to be honest, most of the companies that I'm aware of now would have particular lobby groups or that kind of stuff whose job it is to smooth the pathway to keep the board out of the dirt, because I think as soon as you start getting into engaging that at the board level, you've got, you're running a quite big risk of getting sucked into something you might not want to be part of."
5D,5D_186,Q1,Interesting point.
5D,5D_187,A,"Because not every country operates to the same standards as us, so that idea of graft and corruption and secret deals and stuff like that, I think it would be quite - yeah, I'm quite risk adverse, I'd want to be really certain that we weren't getting involved in something we shouldn't be."
5D,5D_188,Q1,"So, the co-opted position, do they vote? Does that person vote?"
5D,5D_189,A,Generally not.
5D,5D_19,Q1,"Okay, so the reason is to have the diversity of thought?"
5D,5D_190,Q1,"So, they generally don't -"
5D,5D_191,A,They're there to provide advice to the board around a specific strategy or a specific project [inaudible] 00:47:15
5D,5D_192,Q1,Okay.
5D,5D_193,A,"Or, in a short term, to fill it. So, you're going through a major reform process, they might have a specific skill set, but it's clear that it's not for business as usual, it's for something different."
5D,5D_194,Q1,"So, it's not - it keeps your governance function separate to them? Okay, good."
5D,5D_195,Q2,"So, the really high end of town, like a lot of boards I suspect, consulted, use consultants as [inaudible] 00:47:42."
5D,5D_196,A,"Yep, absolutely, so, the retired pol - and they set up their own lobby companies, yeah."
5D,5D_197,Q1,"So, I'm just sitting back trying to - okay, so, your - the way you've pitched diversity is a bit different to what I've heard in the other - so, it's great, I'm just trying to get a handle on how it differs. So, it's not directly linked to usefulness, like, you're not going to have particular kinds of diversity for this sort of thing, you're going to look at - like, someone has to have the background, someone has to have the cultural fit, can you tell me a little - so, this is about selecting people, then, I guess?"
5D,5D_198,A,"Yes, and I think the key thing that drives me with that sort of discussion is, I go back to the fundamental, the board only has one brain. So, that one brain is made up of nine brains, but it only has one brain, so you need that brain to have all of its bits firing. That's where I see that cognitive diversity playing in. [What was that part of your question?] 00:48:55"
5D,5D_199,Q1,"Well, dependent on strategy, where the organisation's going, so, it's really relevant."
5D,5D_2,A,"[inaudible] 00:00:00 at the moment, so, do you need me to sign?"
5D,5D_20,A,Yep.
5D,5D_200,A,"Yes. I think we're stewards, and we're meant to have a long term horizon, and I think if you're creating a board structure where every three years you're pivoting and bringing people into the fit, yeah, we're meant to be stewards and we're mean to be the ones who are forward looking and, you know, assessing longer term risks and managing through - because your management, by definition, has to manage the day to day, it's our job to keep that longer scale. So I think if you're continually going, oh, well - I mean [inaudible] 00:49:35 blockchain's the next big thing you need to get a whole lot of people who know blockchain on the board, yes, but only if you think that it's part of your longer term, which it should be for everybody because it's going to be, but that idea, it's because it's part of where our industry is going and where our industry is moving, not because it's the latest thing."
5D,5D_201,Q1,"Okay, so you separate fad from a serious long-term major paradigm."
5D,5D_202,A,"Yeah, because the people on the board are setting the strategic direction for your organisation. Generally they should be on for a minimum couple of terms, so you're looking at about a six to maybe 10-year horizon. You don't look to be pivoting every three years because you're getting new people on involved for a specific project."
5D,5D_203,Q2,"So, clarifying that, blockchain, fine, I understand that, but for example, a common criticism, or an issue, I know, with a lot of boards at the moment is, there's not a lot of people who really are on top of IT, IT governance, data, algorithm governance, et cetera. Now, the way the world is going, in any organisation of any size I think getting someone who can provide those sorts of skills is very different from the latest fad."
5D,5D_204,A,"Yeah, and that's long-term horizon, absolutely."
5D,5D_205,Q2,"Okay, so that's the distinction, yeah."
5D,5D_206,A,"So my thing's about the horizon, that if you're looking at appointing Directors for actually a three year thing, then that's not - we know that they can have three year terms and they might be gone, but realistically you should be assuming that they're contributing, even if they're only there for three years, their view is longer than three years, and if it's less than three years, employ a consultant."
5D,5D_207,Q1,"Yeah, it's a project."
5D,5D_208,A,"It's a project, it's not a strategy."
5D,5D_209,Q2,"I'm just conscious of time, so, Margo is -"
5D,5D_21,Q1,The means to that end is having a diverse group?
5D,5D_210,Q1,"Yeah, the last questions."
5D,5D_211,A,"[overtalk] 00:51:19 me, I'm literally going to go home to bed, so, you're fine."
5D,5D_212,Q1,"Yeah. So, now we're just at, the final questions are on cultivating diversity as you've discussed it. Does your board do anything to cultivate new potential members?"
5D,5D_213,A,"Yes. So, we have an active nom-comm, and we trawl our connections and go abroad, we choose our Chair really carefully. So, the reason we've got such good gender diversity now is because five years ago the nom-comm Chair was chosen as a woman who had been tasked by the government to find more women on boards. So, she completely changed [inaudible] 00:51:56 put a nom-comm in place, and her job was to find, because we can't find any, to find women, and she provided a list of 10 ready to go women. Some of us were [inaudible] 00:52:08, some of us do not, but that process was cultivated absolutely."
5D,5D_214,Q1,"So, was this like a Women on Boards thing held, or -?"
5D,5D_215,A,"No, the Australian Sports Commission made it very clear for national bodies that they had to have 40%. Basically, National peak sporting organisation saw the writing on the wall, so we gotto 50% just before the announcement was made that they were going to make it. It was very clear in the sort environment that it was going that way, but also then it's now paid off, so the CEO last election with no prompting to a list, there was no list anymore, we had three women apply for two vacancies because we were visibly a board that encouraged and welcomed female Directors. So, I know at least a couple of them would not have put their hand up five years ago, the candidates."
5D,5D_216,Q1,"So, it's encouraged women to come forward?"
5D,5D_217,A,"Yep, so now we're like a [inaudible] 00:53:04, we've got the women sorted, and we still are very aware [inaudible] 00:53:08 the requirement to have 40%, so the succession process is looking at who's going to roll off, at what year do we need to focus back on women, that kind of stuff, because it's a legislative requirement, but then there's also that skill based thing. You know, one of our lawyers dropped off, we had a long discussion of, what is the skill set that you need, where would we go for that, those kinds of things. So, yeah, we have a really good nom-comm."
5D,5D_218,Q1,Non-comm?
5D,5D_219,A,Nomination committee.
5D,5D_22,A,"People that aren't the same, yeah."
5D,5D_220,Q1,"Right, thank you. That's good."
5D,5D_221,A,You'll learn the acronyms.
5D,5D_222,Q1,"So, more generally, do you think diversity should be increased in Australia -?"
5D,5D_223,Q2,Or how do you think it can be?
5D,5D_224,A,How?
5D,5D_225,Q1,Or how.
5D,5D_226,A,"Go and look for them. The only thing that stops them is people say they can't find us, and I say 'us' in the [inaudible] 00:53:55. The fact that we still have boards saying that they cannot find suitably qualified women is just delusional, because there are so many programs out there. It's a very good time to be a woman wanting to be on a board, because there are people clamouring for you. Now, that being said, I'm not saying everyone is ready to go, but the fact that people still come out and say they can't find them, and it would be exactly the same for any group, that, well, we just can't find you. Well, just go and look. I think the difference is, the lesson learned from the women's thing is we don't necessarily put our hand up, we wait to be asked, and that's where you have to have that nominations process or that recruitment process. We actually go and engage people."
5D,5D_227,Q2,That's a basic psychological trait [inaudible] 00:54:40 show.
5D,5D_228,A,"But also, like, I assumed I wasn't qualified, and two and a half years later I'm the Chair."
5D,5D_229,Q1,"Yeah. Do you think it's an informal network thing where maybe the dominant, like, males might be told, this is how you ask?"
5D,5D_23,Q1,"So, you would question, if you saw a homogenous group, whether there could be diverse thought?"
5D,5D_230,A,"Yeah. It's also the smoke and mirrors of how you get on a board, because - again, in some ways, sport boards are easier because they're elected, so we still generally have more elected than appointed, and people will like people like them, so of course you're going to keep getting the same until, as I said, we created the shift where women, like, it's a safe place for me to put my hand up. Corporate boards, it's a very different process of how you get on. They're using more head hunters now, so the head, there could be some work needed to be done with international search firms."
5D,5D_231,A,"But that being said, there is a shift, so, the fact that ASX companies now have to report on diversity and it's seen as a point of difference and that kind of stuff, and the [Raeger] 00:55:46 stuff, you know, there are carrots and sticks that are starting to roll out. But I think the biggest issue is that people love to work with people like them, and it's easier for me - so, we're going through this recruitment process, I was very aware the candidate that I preferred was very like me, so I constantly had to check myself that I wasn't just - that she was a good candidate, it wasn't just because I was like, oh, that's like me."
5D,5D_232,Q1,"Yeah, comfortable."
5D,5D_233,A,"Comfortable, yeah. Whereas I think traditionally we haven't had that level of visibility of our unconscious bias or those kinds of things."
5D,5D_234,Q1,Okay.
5D,5D_235,A,But you're also trying to change 100 something year old organisations.
5D,5D_236,Q1,"Yes, but this unconscious bias you're talking about, in the selection process is it the role of the chair to talk about this?"
5D,5D_237,A,"Yes, and the Chair of the nominations committee."
5D,5D_238,Q1,And the Chair of the nominations.
5D,5D_239,Q2,That would be the critical one.
5D,5D_24,A,"Yeah. Now, obviously, everyone's not going to think exactly the same, and I know that some of the push for gender diversity on boards has been criticised, it was like, well, a rich/middle class, white, well-educated lady is, not terribly different to a rich/middle class well educated white man. There is some difference because of gender, but realistically if they've come through the same private school system and they both work in banking, you know, they're more similar than not. So, I think homogeneity doesn't mean that there's no diversity in thought, same as having diversity in how the board looks doesn't mean diversity in thought. I think that's why I separated out the people from what they look and feel like, because I think there's also that messaging of diversity in the view of the board, as opposed to knowing how the board works as a brain."
5D,5D_240,A,Absolutely.
5D,5D_241,Q1,And so they do?
5D,5D_242,A,"They don't get to the board until they've come through the nominations process, so not for profit or State boards that [inaudible] 00:56:49 nominations process, so State - statutory authorities have to, you have to go to a register. Corporate boards, it's a bit more smoke and mirrors, and that's where you'd need to talk about international search firms, but also, there's still a lot of nodding and winking."
5D,5D_243,Q1,"So, what's the way around that if we want to increase diversity on boards?"
5D,5D_244,A,"I think there's a shift, and I say this with love, but some of the women in corporate environments, when they started as the ceiling breakers there was only one position for one woman, and they fought for it and over it, and there was a, not everyone, but there was a kicking of the ladder out behind you. I don't see it that much anymore. So, I now see women saying, ""I know someone who's perfect for that role."" So, a bit like that discussion around mentoring versus sponsoring. Paul is less my mentor and more my sponsor, so, yeah, I can chat about where my career should go, but Paul's also the one that goes, ""[the participant] should do this role, you should talk to her."""
5D,5D_245,A,"That's what women lack, and the reason - and that's why mentoring hasn't worked, per se, is because the men were still getting tapped on the shoulder by the men above them. That's that sponsoring mechanism, we need to sponsor people up, so as soon as we get a few up then they start to - then they see, oh, that's a great person, the other people we've never ever seen before. So, I think it's just about getting to the point of having enough diversity that then it just naturally starts to come."
5D,5D_246,Q1,"Okay. So, we're talking gender. The other kinds of diversity?"
5D,5D_247,A,I think it would be the same.
5D,5D_248,Q1,"But it's because of - these mechanisms are dependent on the current culture, which you say is changing, but the story is around gender."
5D,5D_249,A,Yes. Carrots and sticks. It's about -
5D,5D_25,Q1,Right. That message of diversity -?
5D,5D_250,Q1,Okay. [inaudible] 00:58:50.
5D,5D_251,A,"I don't think you're going to see it - I believe in quotas. You're not going to see a fundamental change until there is a stick. The fact that my organisation has had a sport for men and women for over 100 years and had never had a decent amount of women on the board - it had its first woman on the board in the '70s, and it had world champions, and it has never had a female chair. So, I was the first in the country, State female President, and only 18 months before I started, we had Australia's first female Chair of the national body. So, it's not about the environment, because it's not like there aren't women tennis people."
5D,5D_252,Q2,"So, you're talking quotas as opposed to a target? [inaudible] 00:59:40 the ASX going?"
5D,5D_253,A,No one meets targets. Why would you?
5D,5D_254,Q1,Quotas are regulated.
5D,5D_255,A,"Quotas are regulated, and I think the idea - no one wants to commit."
5D,5D_256,Q2,"So, I'll flip it another way, because we've heard this as well, and we're going to hear this, particularly when we've got the corporates, isn't the danger, though, particularly when you've got a corporate who's saying, yeah, it's great to have all this diversity, but ultimately we've got to have the diversity of thoughts, skills, et cetera, et cetera to deliver profit to an organisation, all that sort of stuff, isn't it the danger that because you've got to rigidly adhere to a quota, you end up appointing a couple of people who are suboptimal on the other things we've been talking about, and then, if either a bad decision happens or they're just performing badly in the board or whatever, you actually can send things backwards."
5D,5D_257,A,"So, I think my response to that is, yes, that's the fear. There have been centuries of men stuffing things up, and no one has ever said, well men have shagged this board."
5D,5D_258,Q1,"They shouldn't be on the board, yeah."
5D,5D_259,A,"They shouldn't be on the board, so, no, you will have women who stuff it up. The thing I always find, because I come from a quite political family, the thing I always find the most amusing about the NLP's approach to not having quotas to their party is that they have shitloads of quotas. They have a designated number of National positions, and the Deputy Prime Minister has to be National, and they have to have this much media representation. There are quotas everywhere, they just don't want that one."
5D,5D_26,A,"So, if shareholders are looking at what the board looks like, or in my case, its members are looking at the board. My members can look at my board and they can see that it's now 60% women, they can see old and young, they can see tennis and not tennis, and they can see people of colour. So, it looks diverse."
5D,5D_260,Q2,"Well, the Party thing I can understand, because [inaudible] 01:01:18 representatives as well, but just pushing the board thing a bit further, ultimately when you're so performance driven, it's not about [inaudible] 01:01:33 or what, but isn't there a problem -  and we're just going to get this, right, so I'm just rehearsing it here, isn't there a problem if clearly, because you've got a quota, you've got to get this last person on, or these two people on, who, sitting around the table, within 30 seconds it's very clear that they're operating at a different level."
5D,5D_261,A,"So, my response would be, you've not looked hard enough."
5D,5D_262,Q2,Sorry?
5D,5D_263,A,"My response would be they've not looked hard enough. Sure, in the '70s when there hadn't been as many women with business careers or business, you know, entrepreneurs or academics or whatever, there have been professors in business schools and partners in the Big Four, and whatever metric you want to use, Supreme Court judge’s blah, blah, blah, who have been women, for about 50 years now. You can't tell me that there's not, I mean - and again, that analogy,there's more Johns than there is women. So, it's a straw argument, and I know the people who have that argument believe it, so for them it's not a straw, it's a straw man argument. They're not looking for them. Either they don't want to look for them, or they've created a culture that the women don't want to work for."
5D,5D_264,A,"So, I don't think it's as much about - yeah, some of it's about not being let in, some of it's, oh, Jesus, I wouldn't want to touch that with a 10-foot pole. Or, the thing that we often see is, but it's in politics as much as with business, that they get the golden parachute, where they get given the reins of the business just before it's about to crash. So, the blokes all get kicked out and they give it to a woman to fix it, and then as soon as it's back on some sort of track the men strut back in and take it back off them again. So, it's not that they're not capable or they can't find t hem, they're just not really looking, and there's - I will always point out that if you did, in any organisation, a real skills assessment of the men who are in charge, you would find a decent number who are pretty shitty at their job, who could be replaced by an equally shitty woman. Do you know what I mean? I don't think it's about the - you know if they're talking about -"
5D,5D_265,Q1,Yeah.
5D,5D_266,Q2,"Oh, okay. Yeah."
5D,5D_267,A,"Yeah, and feel free to use that in the quote, but you know what I mean, the whole idea about it being on merit, it's like, well, if your bar of merit is pretty low, then we can find you women with equally bad skills."
5D,5D_268,Q1,"Yeah, we can match."
5D,5D_269,A,"We can match it, so - and I think also, too, it's that thing of, that we do have to try harder, so I have to be way better than my male counterparts, because I have to be."
5D,5D_27,Q1,"Okay, so, demographic diversity."
5D,5D_270,Q1,"Yes, if it's on merit alone it would be -"
5D,5D_271,A,"Yeah, I have to be infinitely better to get the gig."
5D,5D_272,Q1,"But in a - with gender I can see that you would see this, but with other kinds of diversity, going back to our earlier conversation, gender's 50% of the population, but other kinds of diversity like cultural background, ethnicity, disability, whatever, what about those? Quotas? Targets?"
5D,5D_273,A,"It would - I would be less comfortable about that, because you can have a woman of colour, and then you've ticked two boxes, so again, which box is - are you putting them in the woman box or the colour box, or do you get two boxes for the price of one? I think -"
5D,5D_274,Q1,"Or don't have women, women are part of the population? Move on to something else?"
5D,5D_275,A,"Yeah and that's the end point. I think the reason that women are easy to quota is because it's a binary - sorry, it's not a binary, gender, queer, you know -"
5D,5D_276,Q1,I know. It used to be.
5D,5D_277,A,"Realistically it's a binary. Again, you would argue - there would be a number of people that would argue if you look at the ASX200 boards there's a whole lot of second-generation Australians, that their parents were post war immigrants, do we count them as diverse? Probably, if we were being genuine, but because their names Peter we don't."
5D,5D_278,Q1,"Yeah, we don't count it."
5D,5D_279,A,"That's what I mean, so I think it's about the - it's much harder to, like I said earlier, and I was being flippant, but how brown are you? Another thing about me is same sex attraction, I'm sure there's heaps of gay people on company boards, they just don't tell everybody about it. There would be lots of people with disabilities involved in boards, we don't count it, so I would be hesitant to put quotas in place for stuff that we don't know what the benchmark is. We don't know what the baseline is. It looks kind of white, but is it literally colour or is it diversity, because Australia, and particularly in Melbourne, we have 50 something percent of the community are born somewhere else or have parents who are born somewhere else."
5D,5D_28,A,"Yeah. We might all think exactly the same way. No, we don't, but we could arguably all think the same way, but we look diverse. So, I think there's a bit of the look as well as the actual thinking."
5D,5D_280,Q1,Dual citizenship.
5D,5D_281,A,"Yeah, or dual - you know, if they're English immigrants or Irish immigrants, is that -?"
5D,5D_282,Q2,Yeah.
5D,5D_283,A,You know?
5D,5D_284,Q1,"Like, how far back do you go?"
5D,5D_285,A,"It gets contrived, because when people talk about ethnic diversity what they're really talking about is the visible bit of what colour are you? And you could have been - I mean, indigenous Australians are the perfect example of that. That's, you know, it's about the colour of them, not their background, so I think that's where it gets -"
5D,5D_286,Q1,"I get that, but there's a part of me that then things, well, now we've reduced diversity to gender if you go along the idea of what unit of measure you can then regulate around, or you can promote and allow the market to choose accordingly."
5D,5D_287,A,"Yeah, I think we just don't know enough yet -"
5D,5D_288,Q1,What -
5D,5D_289,A,"So, I mean, we talk about the bamboo ceiling, so, there's all the Asian graduates coming in the '70s and '80s who hit the bamboo ceiling, so every - I think basically the message is that everyone who's not old white man has got a ceiling. So, I think it's less now about - the quotas is a good way of kind of busting something through, the idea now would be, now that you've broken it, that you can then do bigger cultural shifts."
5D,5D_29,Q2,"So, just to push that a bit further, I can understand, particularly in an organisation like this, with rugby or tennis or whatever, that that look is really important, because ultimately, it's kind of, you're looking after the interests of the members and so on. Would you think that look, I'm not talking about [inaudible] 00:05:15, I accept that, but that look is as important if you're a for profit corporate, without that sort of -?"
5D,5D_290,Q1,"So, what you want evidence - what you could have evidence of is what proportion of your population is the old white man? Of your board, sorry."
5D,5D_291,A,"Yes. All you want to see is a decreasing of the trope - you know, the stereotype, and it shouldn't matter who fills the space."
5D,5D_292,Q1,"Exactly, so that you have [inaudible] 01:07:46 spaces."
5D,5D_293,A,"We have a few less jobs, and then the rest will, you know. Because if you think about what our business schools look like, the white guys are really the minority in what the industry looks like."
5D,5D_294,Q1,"The minority, yeah."
5D,5D_295,A,"So, yeah, I think it's a cultural shift now. I'd just be really hesitant putting quotas on stuff that it's really hard to measure."
5D,5D_296,Q1,Age? What about age?
5D,5D_297,A,"Absolutely, age."
5D,5D_298,Q1,"So, you could do a quote on age?"
5D,5D_299,A,"I wouldn't do a quota, but absolutely you could - but I think that - and again, organisations are starting to do it."
5D,5D_3,Q1,"Yes, you could. Do you want a pen?"
5D,5D_30,A,"Yeah, because it implies, now again, [inaudible] 00:05:26, I'm not naive, but it implies that they're going to be very similar life experience and very similar way of viewing the world. So, as I said, bringing women in implies diversity of thought. Now, there would be, I would argue that there's not - that women, even if they are very similar background and experience and things like that, are still going to be slightly different. I think just what I was cautioning is that sometimes we overstate that difference, that if we get the same type of people, even if they're different genders, you're still not going to have the broader diversity you're looking for."
5D,5D_300,Q1,Why wouldn't you put a quote on age?
5D,5D_301,A,"Because you'd [inaudible] 01:08:23 of skill and experience, and that sometimes comes with age, but not always. So, if you found a 20-something year old candidate who was a genius in all the stuff you wanted them to do, get them. But they are, and I mean, I feel very old saying this, they are few and far between, so it would depend again on what the purpose of the organisation was. Do I want a 25-year-old [inaudible] 01:08:44 a business or running a bank? No. Do I want them running a not for profit for youth mental health? Sure. So, again, it's not about - it's fit for purpose. What's the mission of the organisation, what's the best board to fulfil that mission?"
5D,5D_302,Q1,"Okay. Well, that's sort of what we were looking for in that other section, so, fit for purpose, can you just give me one paragraph on that?"
5D,5D_303,A,"So, again, you've got to be representative of the community that you're responsible for. So, if [inaudible] 01:09:15 based organisations or advocacy bodies don't represent [inaudible] 01:09:21, so if you're talking about mental health, you'd want people who have either caring or actual experience of mental health, and vice versa, what I wouldn't want is then that to be translated into, you have to have someone who's had mental [inaudible] 01:09:33 on every board, everywhere. That, it's not fit for purpose."
5D,5D_304,Q1,"Okay, and quotas tend to - quotas are across the board."
5D,5D_305,A,"Whereas a gender quota is very clearly - there is no one in any organisation that gender is not, they're not represented."
5D,5D_306,Q1,You can exclude it.
5D,5D_307,A,You can exclude.
5D,5D_308,Q1,"Race would probably arguably - but it's again, you know, what bit, who - is it the visual representation, how many generations."
5D,5D_309,A,"Yes, yes, people identify with [inaudible] 01:09:58."
5D,5D_31,A,"But absolutely, when I talk about the importance of - so, our organisation is a champion of change for gender diversity in the sport sector in Victoria. We very much talk about you can't be what you can't see, we need to be representative of our members, we're a 50/50 gender sport, you know. The fact that before I was on the board there'd been never more than 20% women, and there has never in 100 plus years been a female president in a sport that has equal - you know, it's not like we're footy or soccer or rugby, we're tennis. Tennis has always had women playing, so I think that was an important step in basic representation, but I - it's not enough to just throw women at it and it's going to fix it."
5D,5D_310,Q1,"Okay. That's great. So, you're associated with State sector boards?"
5D,5D_311,A,Yes.
5D,5D_312,Q1,"So, how do mandated requirements such as quotas influence public sector boards, when and how were they introduced on your board, and what are the pros and cons? We've talked about some of that, but when, just, was it -?"
5D,5D_313,Q2,"We've talked about some of that, yeah."
5D,5D_314,A,"So, State government board, MOPT, Melbourne Olympic Park Trust, is mandated, so it has to have 50%, and I think that got ratified last year. So, all the State boards now, government boards, would have to have 40% in 2018. Sport boards in our State sector, I think they've got till June this year to be 50% - sorry, 40%."
5D,5D_315,Q1,"Yep? I thought it was much older, I thought this was around for ages."
5D,5D_316,A,"No, it has been for about three or four years, but it's, people - you've got Constitutions with a rolling election, you can't make the change the next year because you'd have to sack your [inaudible] 01:10:50. So what they didn't want is every board in the State to be spilled, they had to allow an election cycle to roll through."
5D,5D_317,Q1,"Yep, okay. Good. Do you think Women on Boards has helped with that gender -?"
5D,5D_318,A,"Look, I'm involved with them, I've done some of their courses. I think they do, they're a good advocacy group, and I think for particular types of Directors, particularly those emerging ones, they're good in that sort of space, but I do think at the moment there are so many groups trying to get women on boards that they're just one of the many."
5D,5D_319,Q1,Okay.
5D,5D_32,Q1,"Can I just ask a bit of a curve ball, do you think if the banking sector had more diversity on the boards it would be any different?"
5D,5D_320,A,"So, there's sector specific ones. So, Change Our Game is for sport, you've got [inaudible] 01:11:32 would have their - like, different sectors have got their own programs now."
5D,5D_321,Q1,"Okay, we might look out for some of those. So, that’s it, the final comment is, do you have any other thoughts to share?"
5D,5D_322,A,"No, I think I've gone -"
5D,5D_323,Q1,"Yeah, past your bedtime."
5D,5D_324,A,I think it's [inaudible] 01:11:46. Apologies and not apologies for swearing.
5D,5D_325,Q1,"[the participant], thank you so much."
5D,5D_326,Q2,That's all right.
5D,5D_327,A,"I'm looking forward to seeing my quoted, you know, looking for an equally shitty woman."
5D,5D_328,Q2,That's a good one.
5D,5D_33,A,"Yes. All evidence points to the fact that a more diverse board makes better decisions. I don’t hold the position that women are more moral or anything like that, because I'm sure - I mean, I can think of some high-profile political examples where they're pretty [inaudible] 00:07:12 some horrible people, so I don't think that women are all the good guys and men are all the bad guys. I know that there are equal - but I do think because of that diversity of thought you get better decisions. Same as, one of the examples I will often use, Cheryl [inaudible] 00:07:30 book gets criticised a bit, but one of the things that was really clear is that she didn't realise how important parking was for women who were pregnant until she was pregnant."
5D,5D_34,A,"So, even if there are women who are rich bankers in their 60's on the board, if they've had a family, they will have a different experience of, this is what maternity leave was like, or this is what it's like trying to juggle family, so let’s not forget about people who have other caring responsibilities. I think even more so now, that's less about parenting and more about that sandwich generation, so probably people like yourself, Paul, who are caring up and down, so, looking after grandkids and looking after elderly parents. So, I think that sort of stuff is where those diverse - the women can bring - even if you're a hard-arse business woman, you're still going to have had in most cases some caring responsibilities. Even if you don't have kids, you might be caring for parents."
5D,5D_35,Q1,"Yep. Good, okay. Thanks. Do you think -"
5D,5D_36,A,"Sorry, I said a swear word. I little bit of a swear word."
5D,5D_37,Q1,"Oh, it's okay, we'll delete it. Do you think diversity of Australian boards is important?"
5D,5D_38,A,Yes.
5D,5D_39,Q1,Because of that decision making?
5D,5D_4,A,"Yeah, that would be great."
5D,5D_40,A,"I think more for business reasons, yes, but I also think Australian culture, we like to think that we're egalitarian and we like to think that everyone can, so I think it would be an important part of our narrative that we don't - we are, but we don't see ourselves as a class-based community. So, I think that idea that if you're got broader representation fits better into people's narrative."
5D,5D_41,Q1,"Okay, but, is there a particular kind of diversity that you think matters more for the outcomes you think are important, like decision making?"
5D,5D_42,A,"Like sociodemographic type, or [overtalk] 00:09:14?"
5D,5D_43,Q1,"Yeah, any particular - it doesn't matter."
5D,5D_44,A,"No, and I think. to be honest, the biggest step change that is noticeable in my industry, in sport, is that we're seeing a larger number of younger Directors. So, Holly Ransom is a perfect example of that, who's on the - she's one of the world's social tech entrepreneur type people, she owns very big businesses, she's on the speaking circuit, but she's on the Port Adelaide Football Club board and she lives in Brisbane. So, they brought her on, obviously, women, but also a completely different football team, so she's not a fan of that team. She sees it differently, she's young. I think the youth aspect is where boards are starting to reach down into, again, not as representation, but acknowledging that they might not have 30 years’ experience, but they have experience or skills in those fast-movingmarkets or understanding what your new market's going to do."
5D,5D_45,Q1,Yep. What about disability? Physical disability?
5D,5D_46,A,"Yeah, look, if it's the right person, sure. Again, I would always caution, and I do this with my broader diversity inclusion work, of them having to have a full house approach. I think sometimes people feel like they need to have one of each set, to collect them all. You can have a wide range of people on your board, if some of them happen to have a disability that's great. I think it would depend also, too, on your organisation. So, I've always, I'm a bit of a lefty, so, don't talk about us without us, so if you're a disability organisation you should have people with a disability on there, same as if you're an indigenous organisation."
5D,5D_47,A,"Yeah, so, there are times when actual representation is important, so in my case it's tennis, we can't not have no tennis on the board. If there is someone from the tennis community who is a wheelie, then that's great, but am I going to actively fight for my bank to have someone with a disability on there? I don't know if that's - I think it shouldn't be an exclusion, I don't know that you need to - yeah, that's getting the full house trump approach. Not Trump, as in politician, but trump card approach, is not - I think that then becomes a mechanism of tick-boxing as opposed to actually looking for ways to be inclusive."
5D,5D_48,Q1,"So, I keep wanting to - there's other questions that could lead off of that, but I better stick to the thing."
5D,5D_49,A,Sure.
5D,5D_5,Q2,"So, as you know, this is just a pilot, and we will re-sort out the questions and that sort of stuff once we've done the pilot, the usual stuff about confidentiality, aggregation, et cetera, some of that. Margo will be the one asking all the primary questions, because she's going to be the constant through the main study. Karen [Farquharson] 00:00:28, Suzanne Young and I are the others on it, and [inaudible] 00:00:31 one of the analytics people. We'll be hit and miss."
5D,5D_50,Q1,Do you feel the boards diversity can have positive effects on the board’s decisions? You've already said that.
5D,5D_51,A,Yep.
5D,5D_52,Q1,Do you feel that board diversity can negatively impact the boards decisions and performance?
5D,5D_53,A,"In a living example that I'm going through right now, we're trying to recruit our CEO and it is taking us three weeks to make the decision, because we have strong diversity of opinion. so, we have two final candidates, they're both excellent, they both can do a good job. We are struggling as a board to land on a decision. I think we've just about got there, but it's taking exceptionally longer than if we just had have had one majority of thinking versus another."
5D,5D_54,Q1,Right.
5D,5D_55,A,"Because it's not so much about the people now, it's more about the strategy of the organisation, so what, which direction we are going will point to which candidate, and we are diversing where we think the organisation is best placed to go. So, it's taking us a longer time to make a decision, which means it's going to be a better decision, but for someone like myself who, Paul will know, I don't like waiting around and not making decisions, so - yeah, I think that's a double-edged sword. I think you can view it as a negative because it can get drawn out and complex, but I do think at the end of it, it will be a better decision. But it's frustrating."
5D,5D_56,Q1,"[the participant], you are in a unique position, so I'm going to ask you this question, as Chair, because you're the Chair of this board, how are you managing that decision? What are some of the key things you do?"
5D,5D_57,A,"I'm trying to lead from behind. So, I do have a tiebreak, we're in a nine-member board, so I can come in over the top, but that's not how we roll. We are a consensus board, and we're not, you know, track - we're a six and a half million dollar, 50 plus staff operation, not for profit, so I don’t, you know, want us to be in that situation. We need to be a consensus board, so I have been encouraging dialogue and discussion with the Directors where we've landed those that we ended up having - that was largely done in person, but a lot by email after the final interviews, that we've very clearly landed in a nearly 50/50 split, so I'm now forcing another meeting because we need to sit down and nut it out, it can't be done by email anymore."
5D,5D_58,A,"So, again, avoiding coming in over the top with just a simple tiebreak, because effectively, the way I view this is you would disenfranchise half your board, and you would have a new CEO, regardless of who it is, starting with half the board not happy with the decision. Now, I'm not suggesting we'll get to a consensus where everyone's happy, but we will get to a consensus where we will have a united decision to take to our members that we will all talk as, that decision is our decision, not -"
5D,5D_59,Q1,Them.
5D,5D_6,Q1,[inaudible] if you want to withdraw. [inaudible] 00:00:40.
5D,5D_60,A,"Not that they've all decided it, if that makes sense?"
5D,5D_61,Q1,Yep.
5D,5D_62,A,"So, I'm pushing that, yeah, that we now - I've now had a small tanty and told them they have to turn up to another meeting."
5D,5D_63,Q1,"And you said that it's based in a difference of opinion about strategy, so will that be resolved as part of this, or that will be [inaudible] 00:14:38?"
5D,5D_64,A,"Yeah, and look, I don't think all of the board have articulated that that's what it is, but again, I've got a different level of, sorry, that my day job as an academic helps, kind of - you can get [meta] 00:14:49, and that's where I've, you know, we were going around in circles, and with that leading from behind I was able to go, okay, well, it's actually not about the skill, because we're going, well, the skills are the same. You know, same but different, equally qualified in different ways, equally engaging in different ways, equally good cultural fit in different ways. So, it's like, okay, it's not about the people, it's about where we're going, and who will best deliver that. So, I don't know if most - if all of the board have articulated that that's actually what we're arguing about, not the people. Because we would be fine with either, we'd just go slightly different directions, and again, we're not doing a 180 with each, but there's enough of a difference that, yeah, it's been -"
5D,5D_65,Q1,And each CEO option is seen as taking a different direction?
5D,5D_66,A,"Yeah, and, I mean, the best analogy is a safe pair of hands versus a bit of a step change, and half the board, as human nature, would like a safe pair of hands and for things not to change too much."
5D,5D_67,Q1,"Great, okay. Well, that's helpful, because we come up with the questions -"
5D,5D_68,A,"You didn't know I was so grown up, did you?"
5D,5D_69,Q1,"So, how does diversity influence your board's functioning, do you think? Do different kinds of diversity make it - do you think different kinds of diversity might have a different effect on the board functioning?"
5D,5D_7,A,"Withdraw back to the house, but -"
5D,5D_70,A,"Yeah. Look, I think we've got - at our last election in October, we ended up with 60% women, so for the first time ever we had an election with two vacancies and three females stood, so we've now got that, which has been interesting. In this decision making process there has been a push back that we're corporate, and it's like, well, none of us are actually corporate, we just feel different, but we've got - so, a Mayor of a regional city is one of our - we've got the second in charge of the Institute of Sport, we've got, of course, a lawyer, a banker, you know, all of those different types of people, academic, and then we're got someone whose entire lifeblood is tennis, so they've been a high level coach and they run big tennis centres."
5D,5D_71,A,"We've got a good mix. I think it makes our decisions - and, I mean, the best example I can give you is, we've got an older lady who has been on the board since the dawn of time, we've finally brought fixed terms in a year ago and she's on the very end of a grandfathered fixed term arrangement, but she has played an important role of being, one, incredibly annoying, but two, reminding us about what a whole chunk of our membership is like, and if we're not helping her understand why we're doing what we're doing, then we're not going to be able to do that with our members. So, I think that's where the diversity plays in. Even if you think, okay, that's old, and old way of doing it, we need to move, there's a whole lot of our community that are still very much that way of doing it, so we need to understand them."
5D,5D_72,Q1,Okay. How is it that she's not a token?
5D,5D_73,A,"Well, she was there first. If anyone was going to be a token it would be me, because I'm appointed, I'm not elected. It was interesting, we were a bit nervous about how the community would respond to an appointed Director being elected Chair, because that's a board appointment, and there was none, but we were ready. There was initially some push back in the constitutional change that happened before my time, that that shouldn't be allowed, a President shouldn't be allowed to be appointed, they should only be elected from the membership, but there's been nothing. So, I think it's about the people in the role, not the [inaudible] 00:18:48 probably get people coming in, not the mechanism behind it."
5D,5D_74,A,"But, yeah, so, she was there first. But that being said, the new people - so, one of our Directors was just appointed, elected for the first time in October, she has a corporate background in her day job, but she's from a local community tennis club and the local community voted for her. Her platform isn't, I'm a digital IT project manager, her platform is, I'm the membership secretary of the Carlton Gardens Tennis Club, you know, which is very much community focused. They have a very strong queer community, so they have an annual drag tournament, you know, so it's - her day job might be quite corporate, but that's not the club that she comes from. So, I think it’s - yeah."
5D,5D_75,Q1,"Okay, that's good. Can you think of ways that boards can [overtalk] 00:19:41. This relates to that, can you think of any ways that boards can help Directors from minority groups feel comfortable with the board, and to feel free to fully participate in decision making?"
5D,5D_76,A,"It has to be genuine, so, that's why I think I made that comment I did about people with a disability. If you're only putting them on because that collects the set, then they're going to know that. No one wants tokenism, it's the same as all the research supporting that you need a minimum of three women otherwise they're not going to be listened to, or they will be deferred to as fixing the women’s - oh, this is a women’s thing, so we'll talk to you. So, I think it's about making it normal that we are diverse, and that it is about diversity of opinion rather than anything else. The reason I can say that confidently is, our person of colour on our board has come from a very privileged background, he's a litigation lawyer, from a long time ago Portuguese/Sri Lankan heritage."
5D,5D_77,A,"So, he's dark skinned but he's been brought up in Melbourne with a very white, private school kind of background, and it wasn't until he was at a national tennis event where all of the other Presidents and stuff were in the room that he ever realised he wasn't the same as all of them. It's the first time he'd ever twigged that he was [inaudible] 00:21:30, because his live wasn't brown. I know this sounds very esoteric, but his life wasn't as a coloured person, his life was as an influential, well paid, private school lawyer. Because he called me straight afterward and said, ""I felt for the first time what women must feel like when they walk into a room full of men,"" because it was the first time he looked around a room of 50 people, and he was the only person there who wasn't an old white man."
5D,5D_78,Q1,Wow!
5D,5D_79,Q2,"You get used to it, as well, I can say from experience. I don't notice it now."
5D,5D_8,Q1,"Yes, but not from the study [inaudible] 00:00:46."
5D,5D_80,A,"He didn't think - it was the first time he had looked around and went, wow, no, they are all very white, very particular cookie cutter, and he was more reflecting on, oh, this must be how [the participant] feels, as opposed to his experience."
5D,5D_81,Q1,"So, apart from that [inaudible] 00:22:14 what you see, was there anything that that group did that made him feel that way, or it was just sheerly the visual impact?"
5D,5D_82,A,"I think it was just, you know, I think he got bored in the meeting and looked around -"
5D,5D_83,Q1,For a reason.
5D,5D_84,A,-@ and became very aware that everyone looked exactly the same.
5D,5D_85,Q1,"Okay, because you are about what it looks - what you see is really important, the visual cues?"
5D,5D_86,A,"I think so, because I think, even if you're not - you know, you can be exceptionally well qualified, and I think most women would say this, but you are very aware if you're the only one, and you would change your behaviour - and they change their behaviour around me. There's a lot of very old white men who do not know how to engage with me, and not because I'm not skilled or can do my job, they think I'm doing a great job, they just don't know how to talk to me because they're not what I'm used to - I'm sorry, I'm not what they're used to."
5D,5D_87,Q1,"Yeah. So, they're asking - so, it's like they're asking them, then, you're different -"
5D,5D_88,A,"Well, it's more that you can just see them, and I mean, it's groups of men versus groups of women, we really have different behaviours when we're in group versus mixed, but you can see them kind of be aware of how they're talking or what they're saying, those kinds of things."
5D,5D_89,Q1,"So, what do you do to smooth over that?"
5D,5D_9,Q2,"Before we start off, whatever -"
5D,5D_90,A,"It's been my entire career, so I don't know any different. So, I've worked in academia and sport, everyone is generally a bloke, although that is changing. I think the benefit I've got in my industry is it is sport, so I can talk about sport, which is [inaudible] 00:23:43 Paul and I got along so well."
5D,5D_91,Q1,Yes.
5D,5D_92,A,"That, unlike lots of women, I can speak their language, so I just start talking about the tennis [overtalk] 00:23:55 something like that."
5D,5D_93,Q1,"Okay. So, is that what you do with a minority group? Like, if someone comes from a different background to your board, how do you help to draw them in to the fold?"
5D,5D_94,A,"We just treat them the same as everybody else. We don't do anything special, but again, that being said, my entire career's been working on access and equity and inclusion, so I don't know how to do it differently. Again, that may be why my board is diverse, because we don't do it differently. That being said, we are all very similar socioeconomic status. I don't think we've got anyone who's not earning a decent coin or not well educated. Again, I would argue that's probably a prerequisite, that's where the merit kicks in, not about the money but the education and the skills. But no, I don't think - and I'm also very aware that sometimes when you're, you know, how should we include this person, the fact that you're actually even - means that you're probably not naturally including them, so it comes across as a bit contrived."
5D,5D_95,Q1,"Yep, it's a strategy rather than a -"
5D,5D_96,A,"So, when we had a guest speaker once, Daniela Di Toro, who's one of Australia's best wheelchair tennis players, I know Danni from other activities in my life, and she wheeled up to the table, and there's - you've got to move the chair so she can put her wheelchair up, we just moved the chair. Like, there wasn't a big thing, it's just we could see her wheeling in and one of us just went and, I think it was me and maybe someone else, just went and shifted a chair so she had some space. So, it's not like the, ""Danni, welcome, how can we make you comfortable? What do you need?"" We just do it, literally gave her a seat at the table."
5D,5D_97,Q2,"Going back to your Portuguese/Sri Lankan person, or whatever, if, as you say, all his life he's probably been in those situations and probably walked into other boardrooms and other forums where - is it an issue, or is it such a challenge to walk into a boardroom and be the only one?"
5D,5D_98,A,"I think it depends on how used to it you are. So, as I said, I don't get too weird about that because I don't know any different. Mark's experience has always been like that, so he won't know any different. I think if you were the first - and I'll use the first in family analogy for university, I don't have - I'm the third generation in my family to do it, so there was no mental leap of, this is a big deal, it's like it just is. I think it would be, if you were the first of your type, or you hadn't had an experience in a gentler way, like, through a committee, or there wasn't an easing in, then it would be really daunting, because you wouldn't know how to act. So, even things like how formal your board meeting was run. If you sit in a board meeting and you've only ever been in informal committees where people say, yep, I'd like to talk, and you just start talking, as opposed to the super formal ones where they go to the Chair and then the Chair directs them, you know, if you don't know the language, or things like - and this is, again, thanks Mum and Dad for teaching me manners, but we go to lots of fancy functions, so if you weren't comfortable in how to make small talk, or which side the glass was on - you know, just those basic things. There's some niceties around governance that we just assume everyone knows because they're come from a similar background, so if all of a sudden you haven't come from that background, you don't know, necessarily, all of the language and that, the social constructs around how we do this."
5D,5D_99,Q2,"Of course, that wouldn't be part of expert selection and criteria."
6D,6D_1,Q,Okay. [the participant] -
6D,6D_10,Q,Because that can sometimes make a difference.
6D,6D_100,Q,I am interviewing a headhunter soon -
6D,6D_101,A,"Oh, yes."
6D,6D_102,Q,- so I will see -
6D,6D_103,A,They're quite interesting. They have their own little stables.
6D,6D_104,Q,"Yeah, I'll see."
6D,6D_105,A,"Well, we've got - I've recruited two women to our board at A large FP organisation (autoparts) and the headhunter didn't [inaudible] 00:14:50."
6D,6D_106,Q,So what - what do you think - what's the limiting factor?
6D,6D_107,A,"Vision? Vision. Their network - if you're not in the network. Again, they may not even know who you are."
6D,6D_108,Q,"Okay, I'll explore that."
6D,6D_109,A,"Yep, explore that."
6D,6D_11,A,"They're paid roles. It's quite interesting, actually, because particularly in the smaller regional and country ones, they're not paid very much. As an industry, we've been agitating, saying, ""You want good people to do it. If you want women on these boards, they have to give up other things. They should be paid properly."" You know, I'm reasonably well paid for my chair role. So if you're on, say, one of the urban authorities, like City West or Yarra Valley, you're probably on about 45/$50,000. But if you're on a small country one, some of them would be on $16,000. You know it's quite a burden of work."
6D,6D_110,Q,"I will, because it will be interesting."
6D,6D_111,A,"You know, they have their stables. They have their people that they like to promote, which is fair enough, I'm not criticising it. But to get on their radar, you need somebody to mentor you into the network."
6D,6D_112,Q,So I'll ask: How do they mentor people into their network?
6D,6D_113,A,"Well, somebody else mentors you. So for example, if you wanted to get on an ASX board and - like in my case, coming back from China where I didn't know anybody - the way I got introduced to the headhunters was through my mentor. So she said, ""What can you do - what can I do for you?"" I said, ""I can't get in to see them - the headhunters."" She said, ""I'll make some calls."" That was the key because they get lots of CVs but until you get in the door and have a face-to-face, they're not going to remember who you are."
6D,6D_114,Q,"Yeah, you're invisible."
6D,6D_115,A,You might have the skills but they don't know you.
6D,6D_116,Q,"Okay, so this is really, really important. So mentoring then - you've said this a number of times - this is a very key thing. Can you tell me what you mean by mentoring and how that might -"
6D,6D_117,A,"Well, part of it will be introducing you to networks. Or when people say they don't exist, they certainly do exist. Part of it is around - mentors are good at helping you get realistic about your expectations. Because I mean, I see lots of young women who are 35 years old and think they should be on a board. I am going, ""No, you shouldn't. You need much more experience before you even think about it,"" particularly an ASX listed board. So mentoring can do that. Some of the mentoring I do, which I do for - you know who Wendy McCarthy is? Wendy McCarthy? Former deputy chair of the ABC? Famous Wendy?"
6D,6D_118,Q,"Oh, yes."
6D,6D_119,A,"So she's got a mentoring business and I do mentoring for them, for lots of young men and women. Part of what you do in mentoring is just help people decide what path they want to pursue. How they contribute - and I mentor for women on boards, as well. So they have - they run a mentoring program. I do mentoring for them, as well."
6D,6D_12,Q,"Yeah, what's the difference in the workload?"
6D,6D_120,A,"They've done a lot - they've done a lot - they've been a huge contributor to the number of women on - by simply demanding. You know, the name of their company, Women on Boards, speaks for itself. Then they door-knock the chairman. They door-knock government. They have pushed really, really hard and they made it a business. Aspiring women go there and join their organisation. They now run it like - they run a site where they advertise - where people advertise roles coming up, which never used to be available. So again, when you think about a network, what they've created is this big network of women who can go to their site. A lot of sites are not-for-profits or government ones, but [inaudible] 00:19:32."
6D,6D_121,Q,"Yeah, I'm familiar with them. I - because they were at La Trobe. La Trobe sponsored - anyone who was staff at La Trobe could join for free, Women on Boards. So I went along to one of their workshops and I experienced their difference."
6D,6D_122,A,"Yeah, they're very different."
6D,6D_123,Q,"Amazing. But yes, so - but that's a long time ago, [overtalk] 00:19:56."
6D,6D_124,A,"Yeah, so they've been a big reason because you need to get some experience. What they've - because they advertise a lot of not-for-profit ones, and a lot of women get these roles now and start to get the experience. First of all, start to work out, ""This is what I want to do. This is the sort of role I enjoy."" You know, you've got a - you can't go in and say, ""I want to be an ASX director,"" if you haven't had some experience."
6D,6D_125,Q,Do you think there's a particular kind of diversity that matters more than others?
6D,6D_126,A,"No. I don't, actually."
6D,6D_127,Q,"Can you tell me, what do you understand diversity means? Because I have -"
6D,6D_128,A,For me?
6D,6D_129,Q,Yeah. What does it mean? Diversity of age? Diversity of Outlook? Diversity of background? Diversity of ethnicity? Diversity of business experience? All those things [overtalk] 00:20:47 -
6D,6D_13,A,"None. None. It's on the basis that you've got fewer customers, but the workload is the same. In fact, in the regions it can be a bit tougher because they're short of money, all their customers can talk to them when they're standing at the queue in the bank. Like, you're really in touch with your customers in the country towns."
6D,6D_130,A,For boards?
6D,6D_131,Q,Yep.
6D,6D_132,A,"You know, you want a board, for example - say our A large FP organisation (autoparts) - which is - we distribute automotive parts, so in great big warehouses. So on that one, we've got Margo - Margie [inaudible] 00:21:02. So she worked for Mars, the big fast-moving consumer group. She knows all about how to shift product around the globe. We've got Jenny McDonald, who was a CFO. So she really gets the finance. You've got me on the legal side, but I'm also really hot on the Occ health and safety side because I've come from industrial backgrounds. So you get - you know, our chair, Andrew, finance background but big capital markets. So it's that sort of diversity."
6D,6D_133,Q,Do you use a skill mix thing to work out -
6D,6D_134,A,"Yeah, we do. Yep."
6D,6D_135,Q,Does everyone have to do that? Is that a -
6D,6D_136,A,"You don't have to, in short."
6D,6D_137,Q,You make it public? It's -
6D,6D_138,A,"Yep. I'm on a superannuation board where you definitely have to do it in superannuation. APRA insist that you do it, and quite right. So you have a big skills matrix, all the skills we need. So that's been a big change. I think probably, Margo, that contributed to more women becoming directors because once you've said, ""I don't have a skills matrix,"" it's not being an old boys club. So, ""Well, have we got those skills? Where can we find them?"" Then you get this, ""Oh, well, you can't - what you get is oh well."" But women come from law, they come from finance, they come from HR. everyone is going, ""Well, that's not good enough."" They did do other things. So the skills matrix shone a light on a lot of that stuff."
6D,6D_139,Q,Excellent. No one has shown that aspect of a skill matrix.
6D,6D_14,Q,Exactly. It's like being a doctor in the little villages.
6D,6D_140,A,It's really important.
6D,6D_141,Q,"Thank you, that's perfect. I want to [go back] 00:22:37, please. Yeah, that's good. Good functioning. This is where your chair thing comes in. We want to understand how diversity influences board functioning. Are there particular board functions that you think diversity really helps with? Can you give me an example? Then another one is - it's relevant to, and another, it can undermine."
6D,6D_142,A,Interesting. I've only been on one board that was all-female.
6D,6D_143,Q,All-female?
6D,6D_144,A,"All-female. One Victorian government board called VMIA. You've got the details there. Chaired by a very experienced female director, Elana Rubin. Really experienced. We used to sit there and say, ""Oh, we probably should get a bloke."" Then we go, ""Business is doing well. We seem to have all the skills we need in the room. Why do we think we should get a bloke because we don't look very diverse?"" Well, bad luck for the blokes. Look, here's where I come from. Because I've heard - you know, people say, ""Well, prove to me that diversity works."" I say this, ""Prove to me the opposite."" No one has ever done a study to say that a monoculture is the right way to go. No one. I've never seen a study."
6D,6D_145,A,"So I take the view, ""I don't think I have to prove anything anymore."" Because there is no study showing this as a preferred - the male - all-male model. I had somebody once try that on me, who was - when I was on the Fire Brigade board. He was a former general. He hated diversity."
6D,6D_146,Q,"Oh, I bet he did."
6D,6D_147,A,"I'd push him and push him and push him in the Fire Brigade because there's so few women in the Fire Brigade. 3%. 3%. He sent me an essay about - he couldn't find any research that would justify having women in the Fire Brigade. I said to him, ""Have you found any research that justifies why there are men in the Fire Brigade?"" Because there is none. Look, it all depends on your particular board. I mean, successful boards are a really good mix of skills or personalities and an ability to make decisions and to get the right information. I don't think whether you're a male or a female, that's the key. The key is that particular group of people and how they operate together."
6D,6D_148,A,"You can - you can, for example - you can get somebody come into a board who is a very dominant personality. That can be male or female and it's very disruptive because it shuts down other voices. I've seen dominant males and I've seen dominant females to do that."
6D,6D_149,Q,It's bossy people.
6D,6D_15,A,"Yeah, there's nowhere to hide. Anyway, the logic is they're big, you're small. So that's changed a lot. I think when I first came back from China in 2010 there wouldn't have been 30 or 40 women on publicly listed boards. That's really changed a lot. A lot."
6D,6D_150,A,"It's just bossy people. Doesn't really help in a board. You need people who aren't afraid to make a decision, but you don't need people who drown out everybody else. Because then you get a single line of the board. So that's where the diversity is. It's different ways of thinking, or different ways of approaching a problem [inaudible] 00:25:50. That can be - doesn't have to be based on gender. You know, the focus is - we've had a focus on gender because it was so unbalanced. It was ridiculous. But the focus now should be on: What is your cognitive ability?"
6D,6D_151,Q,"Yep, cognitive diversity. Can we - do you think there's room back with the gender for an argument about justice? It's just morally wrong not to allow - have women on boards? Give them a fair out go."
6D,6D_152,A,Of course it is. It's 50% of the population. It's -
6D,6D_153,Q,"Yeah, so it's a -"
6D,6D_154,A,"So for me, it's like, really? It's 2019. You want to run an argument that women shouldn't be there? Yeah, get over yourself."
6D,6D_155,Q,"Yeah, so you would use not just the performance of boards, like [overtalk] 00:26:41 -"
6D,6D_156,A,"It's simply you can't exclude half the population from big decision-making. It's [inaudible] 00:26:47, you can't just say, ""Well, you'll have to wait."" In fact, tell me why we should wait?"
6D,6D_157,Q,"Yeah, exactly."
6D,6D_158,A,"For me, it's - you know, I don't know about you, Margo, but this argument has been going on since I was a 21-year-old clerk and I would say to young women, ""You know, stop asking. Just demand it."""
6D,6D_159,Q,"Yeah, [overtalk] 00:27:07."
6D,6D_16,Q,In the last 10 years?
6D,6D_160,A,Because asking implies that it's not yours as a right. I think it's ours as a right.
6D,6D_161,Q,"Yes, that's a good point."
6D,6D_162,A,"You know, we're a little bit apologetic. I say, ""Don't apologise."" It's ours as a right. We're half of the population. We don't have to prove anything special. Trust me, I know as much as you do at that subject. So my view [inaudible] 00:27:38. If the answer is it's because of gender, that's not a good enough answer. The answer should be, ""I've got a better skill set than you've got,"" or, ""They need a different way of thinking in this board because they've got a - a matrix of skills and you've got that skill and you don't."" I can accept that argument. I just don't accept the argument about [inaudible] 00:28:00. I'm as well educated as anybody else. My life experience is broad. It's like saying I want the green plate and not the blue plate. Really?"
6D,6D_163,Q,"Exactly, yeah."
6D,6D_164,A,"But anyway, don't let people apologise because I don't."
6D,6D_165,Q,"So do you think there are particular board functions that diversity is irrelevant to? I'm just trying to think, is there anything that you would -"
6D,6D_166,A,All of them.
6D,6D_167,Q,It's irrelevant to - diversity is irrelevant to your board positions?
6D,6D_168,A,"It's a skill. So if you're talking - you need to have diversity for this. The only diversity you really, really need on a board is diversity of thinking and diversity of experience."
6D,6D_169,Q,"Okay, thinking and experience is key."
6D,6D_17,A,A lot.
6D,6D_170,A,They're the key.
6D,6D_171,Q,That's - they're the roots.
6D,6D_172,A,"You know, the skill set. It's all about - have you got the skills we need? What's missing on our board and how can we fill that gap?"
6D,6D_173,Q,"Okay, so there's two levels, aren't there then? This is - because I'm now - there is a model coming. Because there's two levels. The motor, or what we want - the output - is thinking and experienced diversity. The input is openness to gender, to different genders, to different cultural backgrounds, to different whatever -"
6D,6D_174,A,Age?
6D,6D_175,Q,"Yep, Age. All those different factors, they're up here, but they're leading through, they're influencing through diversity of thinking and experience. That's the root -"
6D,6D_176,A,That's the key.
6D,6D_177,Q,"- that we need. Okay, beautiful. Now I can help to make sense of this because the literature has it all everywhere. Now I'd like to explore how diversity might contribute to conflict on boards. If so, how such conflict can be managed? This is where people talk about - the chair is key and that it ends there. So I want to know what the chair does to manage -"
6D,6D_178,A,"What does the chair do? So first of all, the chair should have an open door to every board member. Because, you know, the chair is only first among equals."
6D,6D_179,Q,Is only what?
6D,6D_18,Q,"What's caused that change, do you think?"
6D,6D_180,A,Equals. First among equals.
6D,6D_181,Q,"Oh, okay."
6D,6D_182,A,"Your chair, because - well, putting [inaudible] 00:30:08 boards. Your chair because the other directors, sort of, ""Oh, she's taking the position."" Those are often influenced by a perspective of, let's say, in a listed environment, is that a person that the market will say, ""Yes, we understand that."" Or is it because you've got a dysfunctional board and you need somebody who's really good at pulling people together? So the thing about chairs is to remember that they are just first among equals. They're just one. Their vote is one vote. I mean, some constitutions say the chair has a casting vote if there's a tie. In the government space, the minister appoints a chair. A lot of that is based on experience and - but the role of the chair, I reckon -"
6D,6D_183,Q,Political alignment?
6D,6D_184,A,Sorry?
6D,6D_185,Q,Would a political alignment the important to the appointment? Or you can't say?
6D,6D_186,A,"I'm sure it happens from time to time. In fact, I'm quite confident it happens from time to time on both sides of politics."
6D,6D_187,Q,So politics is an important - political parties are important influences for boards?
6D,6D_188,A,"Absolutely. I mean, a lot of government boards, the decision is made in Cabinet. Either by the minister or in Cabinet. So - look from time to time they're apolitical in their appointments, but occasionally there will be a political appointment because it might be a highly contested political hot area and they might want a board that knows how to navigate and also not embarrass them if there is a big policy issue around - for example, I'm on the Forestry board. So I'm deputy chair of the Forestry board. That is a very hot, political environment. So we've got a few new board members who were appointed by the Labor Party who are well-connected. But that's helpful for us because it's such a political environment. That gives us channels to go back to the department and say, ""This is where we sit on these issues."""
6D,6D_189,A,"So government boards - I'm not a policy maker. That's government's job. But you are trying to run a business for them and you've got lots of stakeholders. Things like that, the role of the chair is critical. Because in those ones, the chair has to have credibility - a government [Liberal] 00:32:43. So if the chair wants to meet with somebody normally, it's that, ""Yes, they will meet with you. So the chair is definitely the spokesperson for the board externally. The chair's job is to manage the CEO. Because if you've got a board of eight, eight people can't manage the CEO. So typically, as the chair, you will have quite the honest relationship with the CEO. Not buddies, but talk to each other regularly. We'll try to be aligned. Yeah, I'll report back to my board, but the CEO and I can talk on the board. I consult with my board about things. If I'm not happy with the way things are going, I will talk with them."
6D,6D_19,A,"Part of it's just political pressure. Women insisting. Acknowledgement that they're ready. Because it used to be a mantra - ""Well, we'll put some on there but none of them are really -"" it's just not true, is it?"
6D,6D_190,A,"Sometimes I'd ring one or two of them and I'd say, ""This is what I'm thinking. What do you reckon?"" Before I might take [inaudible] 00:33:36, depending on the skill. But your job is to - it's like an orchestra. You know, part of the job is to make sure everybody gets heard because you can get quiet people, people who - particularly in government boards who just want to play to their strengths and think that the only thing they have to do is concentrate on one [inaudible] 00:33:58 of the business. [Inaudible] 00:34:00, ""No, no, no. Your job is also to hold the business."" So you might, as chair, be encouraging them to learn more. I would - I would allocate the roles on various committees. Partly on the basis that I've got the skill set that that community is supposed to have, but partly to educate other people. So, ""Can you go on that committee? Because you don't know about that part of the business."" Yep, [overtalk] 00:34:27 -"
6D,6D_191,Q,Is this your mentoring?
6D,6D_192,A,-@ comfort thing.
6D,6D_193,Q,Is this your mentoring?
6D,6D_194,A,"Yep. ""You'll learn a lot more about the business if you sit on that committee. I know you don't -"" like an audit committee. Somebody said, ""Oh, I've never been to one of those."" Well, go and you'll learn. You know, no one expects you to have all the answers when you go up there, but you'll bring a different perspective, you'll ask different questions. Then you will have voices that are too loud. So part of your job is to turn them down.  Part of it is to protect your board."
6D,6D_195,Q,So what would you do to protect your board?
6D,6D_196,A,"Well, sometimes you'll step out and be the - if there is a difficulty, it will be put on your shoulders. Of course. Or if it's a hot political item, you will try and keep them in the background so that they're protected. If we've got [background noise] 00:36:19 problems with management which and they're not getting on well with management, you'll try and foster a better relationship. Sometimes you have to stand up for them. They might have questions - management will say, ""That's got nothing to do with the board."" ""Yes, it does."" Or sometimes you have to say to your board members, ""Actually, that's management's job. I know it's really interesting and it's in your field and you've got a lot of knowledge, but you know what? You're not the manager anymore."""
6D,6D_197,Q,Yes. It a different role. You keep the scope.
6D,6D_198,A,Yeah. It's a fascinating role.
6D,6D_199,Q,"Yeah. I'm thinking, of course, of the NAB chair and CEO are both, at the same time, after the Hayne's report, being very much in the media and -"
6D,6D_2,A,That's okay.
6D,6D_20,Q,No.
6D,6D_200,A,"Yeah. Well, you know, if you lose your chair and your CEO at the same time, it's a big disruption."
6D,6D_201,Q,"Serious, yeah. That could only be from external, that sort of disruption, could it?"
6D,6D_202,A,It depends. You can get them anywhere.
6D,6D_203,Q,"Yep, you can't generalise?"
6D,6D_204,A,"On my A large FP organisation (autoparts) board, we lost our chair [inaudible] 00:37:18, suddenly found someone. Like, it took three months and he was gone."
6D,6D_205,Q,Of course.
6D,6D_206,A,"They [moved over] 00:37:24 three of us and he had fantastic industry knowledge and fantastic industry respect. So that was challenging. The CEO had enormous respect. So how do you re-establish? How do you keep the ship on an even keel when you've got this [background noise] 00:37:49 succession planning, I guess. When it's so sudden."
6D,6D_207,A,[Background noise] 00:37:56 to 00:38:10.
6D,6D_208,Q,"I'll put this over here. I think we can move now to managing diversity, which is our last page. So when identifying potential new members, does your board consider ways to increase diversity?"
6D,6D_209,A,They're making [overtalk] 00:38:27 we might have to step out [inaudible] 00:38:37.
6D,6D_21,A,"Then you've got a whole cohort of very able women on big boards, like Commonwealth Bank board. All the banks have lots of women on their board. That's started to change things."
6D,6D_210,Q,[Inaudible] 00:38:41.
6D,6D_211,A,"I know, I know. [Inaudible] 00:38:47."
6D,6D_212,Q,"Great. Yeah - so I know you do your skill mix. Yes, you're looking for diversity because that's how you inform - get the diverse views and whatever. So let's leave that question. You've already answered it. Do people outside the board influence your selection process? We've already answered that."
6D,6D_213,A,"The government ones, absolutely. Also on superannuation. So on my super board -"
6D,6D_214,Q,"Yeah, yeah. Tell me."
6D,6D_215,A,"- we're a bit unusual. So we have 50% independents and 50% appointed by the unions and the employer groups. So there are not many. I think we're probably the only one that's got 50-50. Others are a third-a third-a third. So yes, there external parties that are nominate - have the right to nominate directors for our board. So the unions have a right to nominate their incentive and the employer does, as well. But we work with them. Again, we come back to - here's the skill set that we're looking for. It used to be, in the old days, you just got whomever - [inaudible] 00:39:49 and to be honest, in the industry funds, it hasn't done too much harm. Because actually, the industry funds have been very well governed."
6D,6D_216,A,"But now in WA we say, ""Look, we really want these skills, so can you find somebody - even if they don't work for you, you could just get - nominate this person. But these are the skills we want."" So that's quite different. When I used to run the Holden superfund, we had 50% employer, 50% employee. But you know, in those super funds, despite those when you didn't do skills matrixes, got a good result. You know, one of the smartest people on my Holden superfund was a guy from the shop floor. Loved the subject, incredibly well informed about it. Pain in the arse to deal with, however, in terms of knowing his stuff, he was fantastic."
6D,6D_217,Q,So great contributor to decision-making.
6D,6D_218,A,"Yeah. So the concept that the nominees don't necessarily bring the skills, I'd argue with that."
6D,6D_219,Q,But they have voting rights?
6D,6D_22,Q,So how do you think - what created this groundswell of women being able to get there? How did they make that work?
6D,6D_220,A,They absolutely have voting rights.
6D,6D_221,Q,"Yeah, so they've got - right, okay. You don't have any choice about whether they're selected or not? You can just -"
6D,6D_222,A,"Well, they're entitled under the constitution. I don't - in the industry ones, to nominate. So basically, you have to work - you have to have a good relationship with the nominating bodies so that you do get what you want."
6D,6D_223,Q,So there's an important share role?
6D,6D_224,A,"Yeah. I mean, if you couldn't reach agreement, they're entitled to nominate who they like. But in super, you have what's called fit and proper. So people have to fast - pass the fit and proper test. Our fund, say, in WA, we said - well, we say, ""What makes you fit and proper?"" That will include having done the AICD course and certain skills. But you know, you try not to have a conflict about it. Conflict doesn't help there. It needs to be a collective agreement. Government boards, you don't get a say. As the chair, you don't get a say. You just get told, ""Here are your two new directors. It's very irritating."
6D,6D_225,Q,"Yes, I can imagine. I'm - now we're on the super - because I'm just trying to think of the - we've had the Global Financial Crisis. So we've got national policy which is really putting a lot of weight on superannuation funds, in terms of public interest."
6D,6D_226,A,Yes.
6D,6D_227,Q,So there's a lot of political and personal interest in there. So it's a hot - I would call it -
6D,6D_228,A,Topic.
6D,6D_229,Q,"Yep. So - and you can be dilute - you say there is a constitution that, at times, can - in some boards - can limit you to 30%? Then you've got 30% industry -"
6D,6D_23,A,"I just think - part of it was led by the Institute of Company Directors, AICD, who pushed hard for a quota and pushed very hard. So they had the 30% club and started to really agitate. Then they also did things like they had - so they created a company director's course. So a course of study to understand what the role is, as a basic. Then they created another level called Mastering the Boardroom, which was a higher level, and they handed out scholarships for this. A lot of women got a scholarship. Then they set up a program - a mentoring program - for women who were ready or nearly ready. So they got many of them the chairs of big ASX listed companies to mentor women."
6D,6D_230,A,"Well, some industry funds have got 50/50. Others have moved to 30/30/30. We went a bit further. We went 50/50."
6D,6D_231,Q,"How do you do - this is a Constitution? Every board has its own constitution, does it? Who writes that?"
6D,6D_232,A,The shareholders.
6D,6D_233,Q,The shareholders write it?
6D,6D_234,A,"Yeah, and the shareholders, say, in WA Super were the unions and the employer groups. But they've read that 50% independent would be a good thing."
6D,6D_235,Q,Right. When did they do that?
6D,6D_236,A,About five years ago?
6D,6D_237,Q,So that's after the Global Financial Crisis -
6D,6D_238,A,Yes.
6D,6D_239,Q,- and stuff? Okay. So the older ones -
6D,6D_24,Q,That's fabulous.
6D,6D_240,A,"Well, for instance, when I chaired the Holden superfund, which was for all the Holden employees, I introduced two independents to the board. This is in 2002. Because we really needed some extra skills. So -"
6D,6D_241,Q,The constitutional allowed that?
6D,6D_242,A,"Well, I just spoke to the employer group and the union group and said, ""I think it would be a good idea if we had some independents."" They said, ""Yes, we agree with you."" ""Oh, good."" So we got in and changed the constitution and got two independents."
6D,6D_243,Q,So you can change these things? [Over talk] 00:43:51 the shareholders can change the constitution?
6D,6D_244,A,Yeah.
6D,6D_245,Q,Okay. I don't understand that. That's [overtalk] 00:43:56 -
6D,6D_246,A,"This is - all company constitutions, whether it's in superannuation, anything, the shareholders -"
6D,6D_247,Q,Can change it?
6D,6D_248,A,-@ can change it.
6D,6D_249,Q,"Oh, perfect. Okay. That makes - really, that shows me how -"
6D,6D_25,A,Yeah. So that's how it - the board got grown.
6D,6D_250,A,"They're the only people who can change the constitution, the shareholders."
6D,6D_251,Q,What about APRA?
6D,6D_252,A,"No, APRA can't change a constitution. It might approve one, but it can't change it. You know, it's only the shareholders can change the constitution. Unless they legislate for certain things, which sometimes they do. But essentially, it's the shareholders that control the constitution."
6D,6D_253,Q,"Right. There's no competition policy implications for the constitutions? Like, yep, it's -"
6D,6D_254,A,"Like, if you've got your private company and you and your husband are the shareholders, you're the only people who can change the constitution. The only way it changes is if either ASIC or APRA legislate something. So they can legislate, which means you must include it in your constitution. Some things - APRA might [legislate] 00:44:52 something like that."
6D,6D_255,Q,[Inaudible] 00:44:53 - what they can do?
6D,6D_256,A,"Yep, there is an act called the SIS act. Superannuation - what's is stand for? Super - super - superannuation-something-supervision act. I forget what the I stands for now."
6D,6D_257,Q,SIS - S-I-S?
6D,6D_258,A,S-I-S. Superannuation -
6D,6D_259,Q,I'll look it up. I'll look it up. Google SIS and it will tell me.
6D,6D_26,Q,"Okay, so that's all happened in the last 10 years?"
6D,6D_260,A,"I mean, the thing about super, though, is there's not that many funds left anymore. So there's only 300 funds left and there will be less - ideally, everyone thinks about 70 is about the number that will be left standing. Lots of women on boards in superannuation. It's actually really one of those ones that's been a quiet achiever for women."
6D,6D_261,Q,"I think it's a really important area. So now this, of course, is our next question. We've done it, I think. Do people outside the board influence your selection process? You've told me about the politicians. You've told me about super funds -"
6D,6D_262,A,Not-for-profits. Not-for-profits.
6D,6D_263,Q,"Yeah, not for profits?"
6D,6D_264,A,"So often the founder, the big donors. In the - say if - say for the various Catholic funds, or the church ones, often will be the - I was on the board of Good Shepherd for a long time. The Sisters put everything into a trust, which is run by Maori people. But they still influence. You know, they still want to know who's going to be on their board."
6D,6D_265,Q,They set the constitution?
6D,6D_266,A,"They set the constitution originally, yes. Not shareholders now, sadly, because they put everything out into a trust. But when you're on that board, you're very conscious of what the Sisters think. Because originally it was their money, but they put it - they're trusting you to do the job. They certainly influence who might go on some of those boards. The same - you'd find the same at St Vincent's, the Mercy Hospital, or St John of God, all of those. The original church founders. Or in secular work, say, the founder of a company will often have influence."
6D,6D_267,Q,On how things are done.
6D,6D_268,A,"Or even in a listed one. For example, A large FP organisation (autoparts), we were owned by a guy Gary Johnston until 2014. So he's still a very big shareholder. So you'd probably let him know because he started it, he was the founder, still very keenly interested, still a big shareholder."
6D,6D_269,Q,So the chair would probably meet with that person? Meet with him?
6D,6D_27,A,"Yep. Now you know, their course - the AICD course, it's basic - if you want to be on a board, you should do that course. I've got a number of people on my water board who didn't have it, so we've said, ""Look, you really need to do it."""
6D,6D_270,A,"Well, you wouldn't seek his approval. But you'd say, ""You know, we're out looking for a director, subject to -"" you can't tell them things that you can't tell the market, generally. But yeah, you'd always - you'd often go and say, ""Have you got any thoughts?"" Have you got - do you know anybody we should talk to?"" Doesn't mean you're asking for their approval."
6D,6D_271,Q,"Yeah, but you're respecting their understanding of the business and the industry, yeah, and how it should be even into the future."
6D,6D_272,A,"Yeah. Well, the board chair and - other than government ones - that's part of the job, about keeping your ear to the ground. Thinking about - who's next?"
6D,6D_273,Q,"Good. Tension - this is one I want you to feel - do you feel that tensions can arise in board selection between, on the one hand, trying to achieve a collegiate fit? On the other, trying to avoid groupthink? So how can you -"
6D,6D_274,A,It can. It can.
6D,6D_275,Q,How can you manage that?
6D,6D_276,A,"Not just the boards, and I'll give you an example. So at A large FP organisation (autoparts), we were - we're in recruitment stage at the moment for a senior executive. The board's interviewed the last two candidates. We're split on which of those two candidates. The reason being, one of them - very left-field, very different way of thinking. Very, very different. The other one would fit right in. Half the board is going -"
6D,6D_277,Q,Collegiate fit?
6D,6D_278,A,"- [inaudible] 00:48:49 the guys who are going to make everybody irritated. The other half are going, ""No, he fits perfectly. Let's go for him."""
6D,6D_279,Q,So is that split - this was in the literature? What did - how did you resolve this?
6D,6D_28,Q,Do you pay them to do it?
6D,6D_280,A,It's not resolved yet.
6D,6D_281,Q,Oh! How are you going about resolving it?
6D,6D_282,A,"Well, at the end of the day you're not going to die in a ditch, but you get the ripple which is, which is - you know, I am a [inaudible] 00:49:11. I said, ""I like the guy who doesn't think like the rest of us. Let's get him."""
6D,6D_283,Q,"Because that fits in with your model that - where you've got a thinking and experience background. All the others fit into that, including social networks. But the fundamentals -"
6D,6D_284,A,"Different ways of thinking. People who just don't think like you, because then they do - sometimes they just turn the lights on for you."
6D,6D_285,Q,That's all they have to do. Then they can sit down and let you go.
6D,6D_286,A,This groupthink is a problem.
6D,6D_287,Q,"Have you got an example? I mean, have we got time?"
6D,6D_288,A,Yep.
6D,6D_289,Q,Have you got an example of where groupthink was a real problem and you've struggled with it? Just to give me a story that won't -
6D,6D_29,A,"We pay the fees for them, yeah."
6D,6D_290,A,Let me just think.
6D,6D_291,Q,"An example that won't, perhaps, be too revealing?"
6D,6D_292,A,"That's all right. I'm trying to think of one. One is more - I can give you more of an executive one. Some nice senior executive at Gen-Mo. I am sitting in a meeting one day at the very senior level for the region. So there were 12 of us and half of them were engineers. We were talking about a particular car [inaudible] 00:50:16 development. We'd had focus groups with the customers and the customer feedback was very underpowered. All the men are sitting there going, ""Oh, they don't know what they're talking about. There's nothing wrong with this car."" I was saying, ""Are you kidding me? We just asked our customers and you're all saying the customers are wrong?"" Because it's very easy."
6D,6D_293,Q,"Crazy, yeah."
6D,6D_294,A,Technical - very technical knowledge. They thought they knew better than the customers. You can get that a lot [overtalk] 00:50:50 of technical knowledge. They don't like to think that there's another way of looking at a problem
6D,6D_295,Q,Yeah. A non-technical solution is not in their world.
6D,6D_296,A,"It's not in their world. It's not in their world. Or they can think, ""Well, of course you'd solve that problem. You do X, Y and Z."" Sometimes you say, ""Yes, that's obvious to you. But you know what? It's not obvious to the customer."" I had a man once said to me because I was said, ""Can we do that recall - cars do big recalls."" We had a problem with a - think it was [a signal] 00:51:28 or something. No, it was a driving thing. So I'm the only non-engineer on the - and there was this issue. They said, ""Well, of course the customer would pick up there's a problem with the car and they'd stop driving."" I'm going, ""Are you people crazy? You think my mother would pick up that problem with the car and stop driving?"""
6D,6D_297,A,"They're going, ""Of course you would, [the participant]."" ""You're all automotive engineers. You could pick it up. They are not going to."" So it can work both ways. They just assume everybody has the same level of knowledge and would problem-solve the same way they do. Or that everybody is wrong because we're the technical people and we know better."
6D,6D_298,Q,"In health, this is often the case. Well, it used to be. I think it's hopefully less. The surgeon - perfect operation [overtalk] 00:52:16 - yeah, perfect operation. What do you mean?"
6D,6D_299,A,The patient died.
6D,6D_3,Q,"- thank you very much for agreeing to the interview about board diversity. I'm going to interview you as a director and also as a chair, with the mind that you're a chair. So that will be so helpful because it's hard to find people who are chairs. The outcome that we're looking for is we will - not for your particular interview, but for the research - is to develop a model for Australian boards to build diversity. So that's what we're looking to manage and build. So that's the outcome we're looking for. First, how has the composition of boards that you're familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity?"
6D,6D_30,Q,"So you pay the fees, yeah."
6D,6D_300,Q,"They died or they're in terrible pain and seriously disfigured and their life is terrible as a result. Perfect operation - you know, different points of view."
6D,6D_301,A,"Yeah. So you can get that. You can get a management presentation which is highly technical, or you can get - and then sometimes you'll get - say, on my water board - a woman who is fantastic in consumer advocacy and she'll just say, ""I'm [inaudible] 00:52:51. Oh, didn't think of that."""
6D,6D_302,Q,Perfect.
6D,6D_303,A,The lens. She'll bring a different lens all the time.
6D,6D_304,Q,So you would fight for that lens if that was -
6D,6D_305,A,You have to have that lens.
6D,6D_306,Q,Yeah. So it sounds like the one that you're currently dealing with is - or you mentioned earlier - is not absolutely essential. It was just an example of the groupthink versus the whatever.
6D,6D_307,A,Yeah.
6D,6D_308,Q,But if it was this - you had no consumer lens on your board -
6D,6D_309,A,You're selling a consumer product.
6D,6D_31,A,"But no, I think that the work the AICD did was important. The increase of number of female partners in the accounting firms made a big difference - and the law firms, because that created - so what was happening, the first female appointments, most of them were lawyers or accountants. The law firms and the accounting firms, women were getting through. Not at the rate that you might have hoped, but they were getting through. Then there were some exceptions, say, like your Jane Hemstritch. So Jane had nine years on the Commonwealth Bank board, but she had an IT background with Accenture. So it was just that convergence, I think."
6D,6D_310,Q,"- and you were selling cars to families, you want that."
6D,6D_311,A,You want the consumer voice.
6D,6D_312,Q,Yeah.
6D,6D_313,A,"You know, and the same argument goes now for digital natives. You know, we're all non-digital natives, most of us."
6D,6D_314,Q,"Yeah, absolutely."
6D,6D_315,A,We don't think like a Millennial. We just don't.
6D,6D_316,Q,I know.
6D,6D_317,A,"We don't think about the big issues, privacy issues, we don't think like them at all. So there's an argument to say, ""You need to put these young people on some of the boards because - or at least on an advisory committee or some sort of consultation committee - because they just think differently to us."""
6D,6D_318,Q,"Yes, I was going to ask - because you mentioned a 30-year-old might say they want to go on a board, because they can do anything, and you say, ""You know, you've got to actually learn some things before you do that."" I was wondering how -"
6D,6D_319,A,There are other ways to bring them on.
6D,6D_32,Q,"Makes sense because in engineering, for example, in the mining industry, it has been an area dominated by men -"
6D,6D_320,Q,"Yep, you would be [overtalk] 00:54:11 -"
6D,6D_321,A,"- you would put them on a subcommittee, yep, things like that. Because first of all, apart from - you actually don't want to give a 30-year-old the financial risk of being on a board. The personal accountability issue."
6D,6D_322,Q,I thought you - you're insured against that?
6D,6D_323,A,"You're insured but, you know, that doesn't protect you entirely."
6D,6D_324,Q,"Yeah, you've got to be confident."
6D,6D_325,A,"So it's very hard for them to say, ""I had enough knowledge to know how to do this job, to know how to do this technical issue."" So you'd protect them, put them on a subcommittee, an advisory committee, bring them in as consultants. ""Come and educate us, tell what us what you think as a customer focus on stuff."""
6D,6D_326,Q,"So report to the board, learn their perspective and -"
6D,6D_327,A,Just make sure you're hearing -
6D,6D_328,Q,-@ be on subcommittees.
6D,6D_329,A,-@ from that different voice.
6D,6D_33,A,Sure.
6D,6D_330,Q,But also that person - valuable in the future. 10 years down the track -
6D,6D_331,A,Absolutely.
6D,6D_332,Q,-@ they might be ready.
6D,6D_333,A,"Yeah, definitely."
6D,6D_334,Q,"So do you see that as part of a board, and a chair of a board, that you cultivate new board members?"
6D,6D_335,A,"Yeah. Yep, absolutely."
6D,6D_336,Q,Through management.
6D,6D_337,A,It's one of the jobs that you should do is about - how can we get this voice into the room?
6D,6D_338,Q,"Yes. Back to the gender issue then, your friend the engineer, she is really important because her view is about how to cultivate management to enable - how to enable more women to be -"
6D,6D_339,A,Get into the management roles.
6D,6D_34,Q,-@ traditionally.
6D,6D_340,Q,"- engineers - yeah. Management engineers, yep. Not [overtalk] 00:55:43 -"
6D,6D_341,A,"Get onto it early, but - yep. To get through."
6D,6D_342,Q,-@ to get through.
6D,6D_343,A,"I mean, there are some. I unofficially mentor a young woman called Leah Barlow. So Leah is not 40 and she heads up Orica's global manufacturing."
6D,6D_344,Q,"Oh, wow."
6D,6D_345,A,She lives in Canada.
6D,6D_346,Q,That's extraordinary.
6D,6D_347,A,"Yep. I mean, there are young women out there. Seriously smart young women."
6D,6D_348,Q,"I have met some young amazing women, yeah, come to think of it. In the social - this woman was travelling in India and she saw these women - or in Africa, it might have been in. Anyway, she saw these women who were ostracised because they'd had babies and they'd torn their -"
6D,6D_349,A,"Oh, yeah. The uterus and all that sort of stuff."
6D,6D_35,A,Still?
6D,6D_350,Q,"Yeah, all that stuff. So they were incontinent."
6D,6D_351,A,Yes.
6D,6D_352,Q,"So they were outcast. So she developed a business where they could then make money and then - and claim independence, become independent. So she made that - she was travelling in her 20s. She saw that, ""I'm going to do something."""
6D,6D_353,A,There's some amazing women.
6D,6D_354,Q,While she was a student.
6D,6D_355,A,There is amazing women out there.
6D,6D_356,Q,I know. Don't you love it? So yes.
6D,6D_357,A,"Well, they have a strong sense of their own self-worth."
6D,6D_358,Q,"Yeah, [inaudible] 00:56:59."
6D,6D_359,A,They have much more - highly advanced views on global accountability and responsibility. I think my - our 27-year-old - she is living in London at the moment - but she was on the ethics committee for the Elwood hospital.
6D,6D_36,Q,Yeah. Because there's not enough women going through engineering.
6D,6D_360,Q,As a consumer rep?
6D,6D_361,A,"No, as a young lawyer. They wanted a young voice."
6D,6D_362,Q,"Oh, wow."
6D,6D_363,A,"I knew the chair [inaudible] 00:57:24. I think she'd absolutely love it. You know, difficult ethical issues but, to their credit, they said, ""We need a younger voice. We need a younger perspective on some of these difficult issues."" Because - and she'd come home and she'd talk to me [inaudible] 00:57:36. She might have diametrically opposed views on how to resolve it, because I'm of an older generation. They're different. They think differently. Especially about some fundamental things."
6D,6D_364,Q,"Yeah, true."
6D,6D_365,A,"She's just been published in the International Journal of Human Rights and her article was around denial of access to abortion is a denial of human rights, based on the dignity of the person."
6D,6D_366,Q,"Wow, the Catholics would be interested in - in reading that. That would be so good."
6D,6D_367,A,"They - you know, this younger generation, they have a much broader view of the world than we do."
6D,6D_368,Q,Yeah. I studied ethics. I did honours in philosophy to learn - because I was a nurse originally.
6D,6D_369,A,"Oh, I'll send you her paper [overtalk] 00:58:22."
6D,6D_37,A,A lot of women go through. A friend of mine did a study for Monash 10 years ago.
6D,6D_370,Q,"Yeah, do. Because I'm very interested in - and also, I did moral theology because I was interested in working in the Catholic health system. So to try and see -"
6D,6D_371,A,"[Inaudible] 00:58:32 the limits. Like, [overtalk] 00:58:33 -"
6D,6D_372,Q,"Yeah, I'd love -"
6D,6D_373,A,"- another paper, which hasn't been published, with a - access to reproductive technology is a human right, [inaudible] 00:58:43."
6D,6D_374,Q,I'll be very interested. Because I think it's fascinating. I've -
6D,6D_375,A,"But it's an example, for me -"
6D,6D_376,Q,"Yeah, of a young person."
6D,6D_377,A,They are - they think so differently to us.
6D,6D_378,Q,Yeah.
6D,6D_379,A,[Over talk] 00:58:56.
6D,6D_38,Q,Yeah?
6D,6D_380,Q,Is that a request?
6D,6D_381,A,"No, no. No, I was just coughing."
6D,6D_382,Q,"It's also an example of how a young person - 27 - can be on a board, but they knew that she could talk to you, a very experienced board person. Do you think that was in their -"
6D,6D_383,A,"Well, it was an ethics committee, so -"
6D,6D_384,Q,"Oh, it was an ethics committee? Oh, okay -"
6D,6D_385,A,"Yeah, [overtalk] 00:59:15 not the board."
6D,6D_386,Q,"Ethics committee, okay. That's -"
6D,6D_387,A,More about looking at those different ethical issues -
6D,6D_388,Q,I know [overtalk] 00:59:21 ethics -
6D,6D_389,A,-@ and having enough voices -@ different perspectives.
6D,6D_39,A,She's an engineer. Because I work with a lot of engineers. I worked in the petrochemical industry.
6D,6D_390,Q,Perfect.
6D,6D_391,A,"A lot of the not-for-profits put young women on their boards - young people on their boards. It's a great learning - learning area, not-for-profits. Most of them don't have any money, but that's a problem, but -"
6D,6D_392,Q,"Yeah, but you're there for the learning, I guess. Now, do the boards that you're familiar with have any barriers to managing or building its diversity? How do they work? Were those barriers present five years ago?"
6D,6D_393,A,"Well, in the water boards, the barriers were there because most of the men - the directors were male. So if you look at the Fire Brigade, the barrier there was, as a woman, if you can't make a difference - if you're on a board and you've got 3% female representation, can you stay? If you can't make a - if you can't change it?"
6D,6D_394,Q,"Yeah, 3%?"
6D,6D_395,A,"So the other woman and I, we resigned because we said, ""You know, we've been here for years. We have not been able to move the dial."""
6D,6D_396,Q,You'd been marginalised?
6D,6D_397,A,"Well, no, because the unions are so strong there. They don't want women in the Fire Brigade. But more around - let somebody else have a go. If you can't make a difference, if you can't make those numbers change, let someone else have a go."
6D,6D_398,Q,"Oh, this is so good because I have been thinking of board as board - the board experience. Like, managing the board. But what you're saying is, as a board person, if you feel that your contribution can't affect what the business is about, the purpose of what the board is [overtalk] 01:01:01 governing, then it's [overtalk] 01:01:03 - yeah, exactly. It's a waste of my time -"
6D,6D_399,A,And their time.
6D,6D_4,A,"Oh, significantly. So A large FP organisation (autoparts), for example, which is a listed company where I chair the nominations committee, we have a majority of female director's. So we've got - we're number one on the ASX for female directors as a percentage. We've got three women and two men. That would have been unheard of, especially in the auto industry, 10 years ago. Then where it's also changed, if you're not aware of it, is in the water industry in Victoria. So the minister, Lisa Neville - when Labor took power again four years ago - five years ago, she vacated all the water board positions. So there's 180-odd directors on the water boards. 19 - and catchment authorities - and said, basically, there will be 50% female representation on those boards."
6D,6D_40,Q,"Of course. Yeah, yeah."
6D,6D_400,Q,-@ and their time.
6D,6D_401,A,Let somebody else who may have different skills have a go. You can't cling if you're not adding value.
6D,6D_402,Q,Yep. Nice. Okay.
6D,6D_403,A,"It's really important. Part of that would be having enough faith in each other for someone to say to you, ""Look, I think it's time."""
6D,6D_404,Q,It's futile.
6D,6D_405,A,"That can be a chair's job around, ""Maybe it's time to go."" I mean, the good thing about having limited terms is that's made it easier for chairs. So all government boards now, it's three years and three years. So once you've been there six years it's, ""See you later."""
6D,6D_406,Q,What happens after three?
6D,6D_407,A,"They do three and three. So they'll often renew you for a second term, but they're -"
6D,6D_408,Q,"Yep, but they have an opportunity -"
6D,6D_409,A,"- not going to renew you for nine years. I mean, there are a few exceptions. I've been on the forestry board for seven and a half years, but it's an exception. But typically, part of that is around renewal. Let other people have a go. Government bodies let more people get that experience rather than people just clinging to these roles. Sorry, that wasn't part of the question, was it?"
6D,6D_41,A,"So she said, ""Why are women not getting through?"" What they found - or her research was that the job was boring. So after a few years they go, ""Oh, this is boring. I don't want to do this."" A lot of them went to do something else."
6D,6D_410,Q,Yeah. It's barriers to management building its diversity.
6D,6D_411,A,"Oh, barriers, it's often the -"
6D,6D_412,Q,So these are often institutional -
6D,6D_413,A,- can often be your CEO -
6D,6D_414,Q,Yeah? Okay.
6D,6D_415,A,"- who doesn't recruit women into the executive. It's the management [background noise] 01:02:30 if you don't have a CEO who is going to really go for it. What you might find, say, at A large FP organisation (autoparts) - don't quote me on this one."
6D,6D_416,Q,"No, no."
6D,6D_417,A,"60% female on the board, one female executive. That's all. Driving us to distraction, but we have a CEO who is old school. Getting him, ""Oh, you know, I haven't been able to find female recruits [inaudible] 01:02:53."" Yeah. So you still get that paternalistic view."
6D,6D_418,Q,"Yeah, I know the type."
6D,6D_419,A,"Or, ""Yeah, we're bringing young women along."" You go, ""Yeah, you've got a whole lot of women driving cars, but I don't have any - see women making decisions about [inaudible] 01:03:12."" So I find that's the biggest barrier because I think most boards know [inaudible] 01:03:17. I mean, there might be a couple of outliers, but most boards get the real battle now is [given] 01:03:24 those layers of female capability and insisting that the executive have a number of - a number of female executives. That it's not an all-male group that - when they walk in the room."
6D,6D_42,Q,So what's her name? That research could be interesting.
6D,6D_420,Q,"As a board, you can't impose that on the organisation?"
6D,6D_421,A,You can [overtalk] 01:03:40 - you can't. It's just a target. It's the CEO -
6D,6D_422,Q,"Oh, it's operational."
6D,6D_423,A,"- team. You can give him that target in his KPIs, and you can punish them if he doesn't get to his target, but he still has to choose his team. So you put a lot of pressure on him, but you don't do the appointment. So you can pressure a lot."
6D,6D_424,Q,Can you sack a CEO over this?
6D,6D_425,A,"If he was not meeting his targets and not heeding the board, you could. You could say, ""It's not working. We think these things are really important. You don't. We're going different ways."""
6D,6D_426,Q,[Inaudible] 01:04:13.
6D,6D_427,A,"Yes. So for lots of big issues, not just [overtalk] 01:04:15 -"
6D,6D_428,Q,"Oh, of course."
6D,6D_429,A,"- diversity it's around. I mean, you rarely sack the CEO. You do sometimes. I've been known to be involved in the departure of a couple of CEOs."
6D,6D_43,A,Her name is Deb Brown.
6D,6D_430,Q,"Yeah. It would have to be really serious, yeah? As in a divide?"
6D,6D_431,A,"Part of it has to be around - not even - CEOs, my view is that they have a lifespan that should not be beyond 10 years. They run out of energy. They run out of good ideas. They have a cycle where they come in, they're change agents, then they build on that, and then it goes."
6D,6D_432,Q,Okay. Life-cycle.
6D,6D_433,A,"I mean, it's rare that you'd say, after 10 years, you should be appointed CEO. Because apart from anything else, you're not getting diversity of thinking anymore. Not thinking [inaudible] 01:05:03, you're not getting that new wave of thinking coming in. ""This is the way we do things here."" This person is a CEO and this is the way we do things. It's the same thing. Not just at the board level."
6D,6D_434,Q,"Okay, that's -"
6D,6D_435,A,I find that's the biggest barrier.
6D,6D_436,Q,- [overtalk] 01:05:20 -
6D,6D_437,A,"Capability is not - in my opinion, it's not lack of capability. There's heaps of capable people - there are all forms. It's simply that people have their own vision and they want to work with someone like them, or someone they've known. Someone they've known can be a real barrier, means that they won't look at somebody they've never met or [inaudible] 01:05:46 totally their field. Say, ""Oh, yeah. Look, I'm so comfortable with this person,"" and that can work against women, or against somebody who has an accent, or a different -"
6D,6D_438,Q,"Yeah, coloured skin -"
6D,6D_439,A,"- ethnic background, all that sort of stuff."
6D,6D_44,Q,"Deb Brown. Oh, give me her number."
6D,6D_440,Q,"All that stuff, yeah."
6D,6D_441,A,"""They're just not quite like us,"" you know what I mean?"
6D,6D_442,Q,"Yeah, they know the culture. From a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about how the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted?"
6D,6D_443,A,"I think it's going fine. Although, to be honest, that our company has among the highest representations is a bit of a surprise. We go, ""Really? We're the best?"" It's been very effective in your [inaudible] 01:06:27. Look, you could go quotas. The trouble with quotas is that gives the naysayers the opportunity to say they wouldn't be there without the quota. It can be so undermining for the women and so - and I don't think it's so desperate yet."
6D,6D_444,Q,"That you need quotas? Because it is a cost, isn't it?"
6D,6D_445,A,It's a cost.
6D,6D_446,Q,"Or a risk? Well, it's probably just a cost."
6D,6D_447,A,It's not a risk. There's capable women out there. It's more about -
6D,6D_448,Q,Do you know what I mean? It's a cost to women to be -
6D,6D_449,A,It's a cost to women.
6D,6D_45,A,"Yep. I mean, it's quite a few years since Deb did it."
6D,6D_450,Q,- to be undermined just because [overtalk] 01:07:01 -
6D,6D_451,A,"When they started putting women on the bench in Victoria, all these members said, ""She's only on there because she's a woman."" They were perfectly capable women, but a lot of them had to put up with a lot of crap. So quotas, for me - I think we're making progress. But if in 10 years' time you asked me that question, we haven't improved, we'll go, ""Yeah, put the quota in."" I think the more interesting thing is around what's going on at pay diversity at the entry level. Because still, women start on a lower salary than men for the same job. One of the things that needs to happen, and which we do on most of my boards, is that we do these surveys of the pay disparity."
6D,6D_452,A,"So we get the numbers. We say, ""Dice it up, tell us how many women and men you've got in this group and what's the average salary and why is it different?"" Then we also try and track the promotion rate."
6D,6D_453,Q,"Hang on, I'm intrigued. Isn't that operational?"
6D,6D_454,A,"Yes, but you say, ""I want a report on it."""
6D,6D_455,Q,"Okay, a description of the workforce -"
6D,6D_456,A,I want a report on it.
6D,6D_457,Q,-@ in terms of diversity.
6D,6D_458,A,"So twice yearly, I want a report on it."
6D,6D_459,Q,In terms of fee structure. Wow.
6D,6D_46,Q,"It doesn't matter. You said 2012, didn't you?"
6D,6D_460,A,"You know, how many women have got - how many are taking - how many people are taking paternity or maternity leave? How many people working part-time? What's the rate of promotion? What is the average salary at each level? Who's getting it? So you'll pick up disparity. Like on my Forestry board, when we started doing that, we really noticed. So we've remedied it at the executive level. So everybody is getting paid the same. But we now know that we've got a - at the entry level, things are fine. Halfway through, women fall off the cliff."
6D,6D_461,Q,Is this because it's the maternity age?
6D,6D_462,A,"Part of it is, part of it is just the promotion rate impacted by maternity."
6D,6D_463,Q,As soon as you get to that age -
6D,6D_464,A,"But no, we've said, ""Go back. Find out why they're falling off a cliff. Don't just assume."""
6D,6D_465,Q,"Yeah, yeah, I'm wondering whether that -"
6D,6D_466,A,Let's [overtalk] 01:09:03 what the problem is.
6D,6D_467,Q,I'd be intrigued. That is a really interesting -
6D,6D_468,A,"Yeah. In one - at VMIA, when we first did this, we had to do a lot of catch-up. Say, ""Well, why are these women getting paid less?"" There was no reason. When they came back with, ""We can't tell you why,"" we said, ""Fine. Fix it."""
6D,6D_469,Q,That's great. So -
6D,6D_47,A,"No - yeah, I forget when she did it. But it's probably 10 years ago."
6D,6D_470,A,So that will make a huge difference.
6D,6D_471,Q,"Tell me the difference it will make, the pay structure."
6D,6D_472,A,"Well, for the women it means they are valued. It means that they are not going to end up with less super than the men because they started - for five or 10 years they were getting paid less."
6D,6D_473,Q,"Of course, yes."
6D,6D_474,A,"It also means, if you're watching the promotion rates, that you ask, ""Why are those men getting promoted above - at a different rate to the company women?"" Often there will be reasons. There could be education or, ""Are you not giving that person the cross-functional job they need? So that they didn't get the experience? Why didn't they get the experience?"" You can drill into it. Often there are good reasons but sometimes people say, ""I don't know why."" You go, ""Fine. Then you need - you've got a problem. You need to fix it."" If you don't know why, it's probably simply - you can imply that it was simply because she was a woman, he was a man. I say, ""Go fix it."""
6D,6D_475,Q,So you're managing the diversity within the management stream feeding up to -
6D,6D_476,A,You've got to.
6D,6D_477,Q,"- [overtalk] 01:10:28, beautiful."
6D,6D_478,A,Absolutely got to. Otherwise you're not going to get women through.
6D,6D_479,Q,Okay. So - and that will lead into looking 10 years into the future.
6D,6D_48,Q,"Yeah, okay."
6D,6D_480,A,"[Inaudible] 01:10:36. I'll give you an example, Margo. When I was at GM, I had this hot young lawyer working for me. She was fantastic. The business loved her. They loved her. They'd all come and ask for her, she was so good. Really engaging, she could always understand people's problems. She'd fix it for - anyway, she had two periods of maternity leave. Then she came back part-time. I wanted to promote her to the level above just under executive. So I put up - and we ran this stuff globally for promotion. I get this, ""You can't promote her, Theresa."" [Inaudible] 01:11:06. ""We never promote a part-timer."" I said, ""I beg your pardon?"" ""Oh, no. We couldn't, she's only working part-time."" I said, ""Well, if we don't promote her, we'll lose her."" Yeah, I got her promotion through, but it was the first time that GM had agreed to promote a part-timer to that level. I couldn't believe it. They're going, ""Oh, no, no. She's only a part-timer."""
6D,6D_481,Q,When was that? What year?
6D,6D_482,A,That was 2005 or something.
6D,6D_483,Q,"Gee, that's slow."
6D,6D_484,A,"I said, ""The business loves her. They want her here. She is doing the work. Yes, she's only doing it three days a week, but you know what? She's doing the work."""
6D,6D_485,Q,Yeah. How good she is to be able to -
6D,6D_486,A,"So why wouldn't we promote her? We got through, but they just had an automatic response. ""Part-timer, we don't promote part-timers."""
6D,6D_487,Q,"Yes, a modus operandi acted against treating her fairly."
6D,6D_488,A,"Yeah, and they're still on that embedded stuff. There's still a lot of thoughts about job sharing, part-time work - you're not serious. I had someone say that to me one day and I said, ""You think that person is not serious? She's got two kids. She gets to work on time and gets her job done. A lot of men here don't do that. [Over talk] 01:12:19 so don't tell me she's not serious about her job. The fact that she comes tells me she serious."""
6D,6D_489,Q,"That's right, yeah."
6D,6D_49,A,But there is an interview.
6D,6D_490,A,"Imagine how this woman is not serious? He said to me - we're doing a review of talent. ""Oh, finally,"" he said, ""a woman who is serious about her job."" I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""Well, she doesn't have any children."""
6D,6D_491,Q,"Well, that could be sexual orientation, as well. Oh, but isn't that amazing? So -"
6D,6D_492,A,So you've still got [overtalk] 01:12:46 -
6D,6D_493,Q,- this is an embedded thinking that you have to -
6D,6D_494,A,"You've got to fight against it and if you don't get the statistics, you can't track it. You've got to track it."
6D,6D_495,Q,"I'm going to put here, in terms of diversity, another fact which I had never read about, is the casual versus full-time."
6D,6D_496,A,Yep.
6D,6D_497,Q,So it's casual -
6D,6D_498,A,Or part-time versus full-time.
6D,6D_499,Q,"See, that - yeah, part-time - part-time versus - because [overtalk] 01:13:16 actually works at the beginning and the end of [overtalk] 01:13:19 this, as well."
6D,6D_5,A,"So she - she opened it up, yep. So everybody lost their board position. There were a number of women on those boards, but there were no chairs shares and it was a bit of an old boys club. Then at the end of that - so they had three or four interview panels. They interviewed 1400 people and 52% of boards in water industry are female. I think we're 50/50 female to male chairs. So a big change."
6D,6D_50,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
6D,6D_500,A,"These big water authorities - Barwon, which is one of the really big ones, they were going for a CFO recently. They advertised it as a job that could be done part-time."
6D,6D_501,Q,See? Yeah.
6D,6D_502,A,"So they changed the whole way they went out to recruit and thought about, ""How will we attract women to this role?"" They said, ""Does it have to be full-time? Maybe not."""
6D,6D_503,Q,"That can work for men, too."
6D,6D_504,A,"It works fine for men, too."
6D,6D_505,Q,"It's interesting, but it's a barrier to women."
6D,6D_506,A,It's a barrier.
6D,6D_507,Q,"So in 10 years - looking 10 years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
6D,6D_508,A,"Well, they wouldn't all be the same colour, for a start."
6D,6D_509,Q,"Good, yeah."
6D,6D_51,A,"She's held lots of interviewing roles, operational roles. I'll give you Deb's number. Just tell her I said you'd give her a call. Bear with me."
6D,6D_510,A,"They wouldn't all be Christian because we really have to get past this dominant Judaeo-Christian [inaudible] 01:14:13. You know, I would say that the issue of gender diversity would have to be something no one ever has to talk about anymore. It will just be non-existent."
6D,6D_511,Q,Modus operandi.
6D,6D_512,A,"Not necessary, it's just the way things are. It will be younger. Although -"
6D,6D_513,Q,Why would it be younger?
6D,6D_514,A,"Well, I think it will be younger because they're better educated than we were, these kids."
6D,6D_515,Q,"But in 10 years' time, the young ones are -"
6D,6D_516,A,"Yeah, but the young ones now who are 40 will be 50."
6D,6D_517,Q,"But are you saying that in 10 years' time, 20-year-olds will be on boards? That they're [overtalk] 01:14:50 -"
6D,6D_518,A,"No, no, no. But it will - you will get more younger people because it will be seen as a proper career rather than an end-of-career activity. Because for a lot of people, it's an end-of-career activity. Like, I finished my executive life. I don't want to retire, what should I do? It will become more of a profession, which is what it is becoming."
6D,6D_519,Q,"Right, and what's influencing that?"
6D,6D_52,Q,That's okay.
6D,6D_520,A,"Part of it would be around - it used to be you had to be a very, very senior person - male, didn't need the money. Couldn't do it until I was 75. Those things have changed. So I think - and the AICD has been pushing this as a professional activity."
6D,6D_521,Q,"Yes, with courses and things."
6D,6D_522,A,"I mean, there is a thought that you could have a robo-director."
6D,6D_523,Q,Robo?
6D,6D_524,A,Yep. Artificial intelligence.
6D,6D_525,Q,"Oh, okay."
6D,6D_526,A,Feed the information in.
6D,6D_527,Q,"Yes, a computer will help."
6D,6D_528,A,You could have robo-decision-making in boards. You've got all this information. The AI works on it. Here's the answer.
6D,6D_529,Q,"Artificial intelligence. So we don't need boards, we've got -"
6D,6D_53,A,"Deborah - 0447 583 432. That's her email address, if you want it?"
6D,6D_530,A,You might have a combination.
6D,6D_531,Q,"That's a good idea because they can make - ""Here is the rational,"" or whatever."
6D,6D_532,A,"It depends on - it depends on the algorithm in ways. But you might have a combination of human and AI, which would be really interesting."
6D,6D_533,Q,That would be really neat.
6D,6D_534,A,You want to talk diversity?
6D,6D_535,Q,Let's put that in. Let's put that in. I like that.
6D,6D_536,A,"Also what you need to remember about AI is that it's the - it's the person who creates the program, not the AI tool. It's the culture of the person writing the program that's fascinating. So if you're going down the path of AI decision-making, you're going to have 21-year-old geeks who live in the middle of Sichuan or somewhere writing programs. So their biases, their culture, their imports will influence what comes out the other end."
6D,6D_537,Q,"It's interesting, there will need to be a change in terms of the legal framework because the accountability - legal liability of the artificial intelligence -"
6D,6D_538,A,Yep.
6D,6D_539,Q,"- at the moment, it's not a person under the law to be held to account."
6D,6D_54,Q,"Oh, okay. Thanks."
6D,6D_540,A,"Yep, it's going to be fascinating. Absolutely fascinating."
6D,6D_541,Q,I love it. Can we leave it on that note? Because I really like that. That would be really good.
6D,6D_542,A,Very happy to. Thank you -
6D,6D_543,Q,So that was so good -
6D,6D_55,A,"That's easier, isn't it?"
6D,6D_56,Q,Deb [inaudible] 00:08:02 Brown at Gmail.com. Beautiful.
6D,6D_57,A,"So Deb's had lots of experience. She's a senior engineer, done lots of operations work in male dominated industries."
6D,6D_58,Q,Would she be on the board?
6D,6D_59,A,"I don't know if she's on the - she might be on the not-for-profit. I'll search, but she is the sort of person that - when boards so they can't find capable female engineers, you go, ""Really?"""
6D,6D_6,Q,That's amazing.
6D,6D_60,Q,"Yeah, so she is an influencer? Okay. Beautiful. Thank you for that."
6D,6D_61,A,That's all right.
6D,6D_62,Q,"So I'm moving all around you. But I think let's go with our flow. So how important do you think it is to have a diverse board? If, let's say, 10 is real - extremely important and one is not."
6D,6D_63,A,It's extremely important. So we're 50% of the population. 50% of the customers of every business.
6D,6D_64,Q,At least.
6D,6D_65,A,"We do - we do behave differently. I think we're more collegiate. On my board, for example, A large FP organisation (autoparts), with three and two, we girls want girls - women. We bring each other up about, ""What do you reckon?"" We'll talk about things more openly. We're probably more honest with each other. I don't know whether that's just a female affiliation thing, but I think we're less afraid to ring and say, ""I need a shoulder to cry on."" Sort of."
6D,6D_66,Q,Yeah.
6D,6D_67,A,"I think we're also less afraid to say, ""I don't know the answer."""
6D,6D_68,Q,Publicly at the board?
6D,6D_69,A,Yep.
6D,6D_7,A,In the water industry -
6D,6D_70,Q,Okay.
6D,6D_71,A,"We don't mind asking questions. People say, ""Oh, you should know the answer."" Well, I don't know the answer so I'm still going to ask the question. We also focus on different things. We're more - I think women pay more attention of the detail. Men good at the big picture stuff - my observation. Women are really good at the detail and you need both. You do need people who are really - can always see the big picture. But somebody who can get into the finer [overtalk] 00:10:19 work. Hello."
6D,6D_72,A2,Hello.
6D,6D_73,A,"Hi, Sam."
6D,6D_74,Q,That's good. Okay. So -
6D,6D_75,A,"I mean, apart from anything else, you just need a female perspective on things."
6D,6D_76,Q,Yes. So you're talking about diversity as gender. What about other kinds of diversity?
6D,6D_77,A,"Oh, that's what's missing. That's really missing. You know, if you were to look at the 19 Victorian water boards, you wouldn't find a woman with a headscarf. You wouldn't find an African. You might find a couple of Asian streams. Probably not going to find - you might find one or two [Armenian] 00:11:02 extraction. You certainly wouldn't see a male Muslim with a beard and there'd be no Indigenous. Not for want of trying, but, for example, we're coming up again for board renewal on my water board and the department asks you what you want. They asked us to years ago and we gave them the same answer. ""We'd like somebody who is Indigenous or African or disabled."" We got two male interviews. ""Oh, what?"" Part of it is because they're - there is a curve. Learning curve. It's the same issue as - are they ready? My own view is you don't have to be totally ready."
6D,6D_78,Q,"Yeah, you can learn on the job."
6D,6D_79,A,"You can learn on the job. We say that to them. We say, ""You can give us somebody who's not ready. There's enough of us who know what we're doing and we can teach. They don't have to come in fully polished."" So that's some of the barriers."
6D,6D_8,Q,They're paid - are they paid positions?
6D,6D_80,Q,"Okay, so -"
6D,6D_81,A,"Also, people just don't know where to look. So if you say, ""Look, we'd really like an Indigenous person on our board,"" no one knows where to look. It's not obvious."
6D,6D_82,Q,"Yeah, I would have thought that there'd be some organisation of leaders or something that you could just go to and then you'd have that. That's not organised?"
6D,6D_83,A,"Well, the Indigenous community particularly, it's very broken up into lots of regions. Also for many of them, there are big demands on them and they're very small organisations."
6D,6D_84,Q,"That I could understand, yes."
6D,6D_85,A,"So they've got lots of people coming in and wanting things and they're very small organisations. So La Trobe City Council, for example, is doing a really good job of trying to channel a lot of people who want things from the Indigenous community by saying, ""They can't deal with all of you, so come to us. We'll deal and you tell us what you need and we'll see what we can find for you."" Anyway, if you think of the African community, first, it's not their culture to want to be on a board - yet. But it's a big - it's a big gap."
6D,6D_86,Q,"Because we're second generation Africans, wouldn't we be now?"
6D,6D_87,A,"Yeah, but you still - there's still confidence, networks. You know, where is the network? That's the sort of thing that holds people back, too, is the lack of networks. That's why - that's why they've - the female representation has got much better because there is a big network. It's quite a big network."
6D,6D_88,Q,It's interesting. So networks are important -
6D,6D_89,A,Yep.
6D,6D_9,A,- [overtalk] 00:02:08 they're paid roles. They're paid roles.
6D,6D_90,Q,"- whereas another interview I said, ""Well, what about networks?"" ""Well, I see that as counter to diversity."""
6D,6D_91,A,No.
6D,6D_92,Q,"Yeah, yeah."
6D,6D_93,A,"You've got to have the networks because you have to hear about things. You have to have bodies, you have to have people on call, you have to hear about things. Without a network, how do you hear what's happening?"
6D,6D_94,Q,"Yes. So you're - yeah, so this is how the supply chain works, only through a network."
6D,6D_95,A,"Not only, but it's a big contributor."
6D,6D_96,Q,With a - let's say an invisible group or a disadvantaged group -
6D,6D_97,A,They don't have that network -
6D,6D_98,Q,It's fairly important.
6D,6D_99,A,"So two things, they don't have a network that the other networks can go to. That's a - when you say - well, they don't know where to look. Now there may well be a big network of Indian community or Muslim community in the western suburbs, what have you. But if I'm sitting on the rem committee of a listed company, how do I even approach them? The headhunters are not good at that."
7IN,7IN_1,Q,"I think what I really like about the research is that we’re talking to people on boards and people who influence boards to develop a model, so it’s like the ground up."
7IN,7IN_10,A1,Bachelor of Economics and Master of Finance.
7IN,7IN_100,A1,Was it in the US?
7IN,7IN_101,Q,"It is written by the US, but it’s a review of all the literature."
7IN,7IN_102,A1,Yep.
7IN,7IN_103,Q,"I think you’ve already done that, you’ve already explained how you do it. So what does board diversity mean to you? Now we’re going to get to the crunch."
7IN,7IN_104,A1,"Board diversity, to me -Secondary participant might have seen - it’s what we were talking about before."
7IN,7IN_105,Q,I’ll just insert that from page 10.
7IN,7IN_106,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_107,Q,"Yep, beautiful. But you know one that’s not there, social networks."
7IN,7IN_108,A1,Social networks?
7IN,7IN_109,Q,"Yeah, in the literature there’s some talk about networks, because board members can use their networks to - so diverse networks is not -"
7IN,7IN_11,Q,"Okay, so finance and economics, and -"
7IN,7IN_110,A1,"I mean, I take networks to be a block to diversity."
7IN,7IN_111,Q,"Ah, good."
7IN,7IN_112,Q,"That’s how I think of networks. If I’m using my network, I’m probably using people who I went through uni together with, or through school together with, or live near, or have the same interests outside of working, which could indeed involve some diversity, but not typically proper diversity."
7IN,7IN_113,Q,"Lovely. I like that. I’ll pull that out later when we - so is that similar with your research, have you looked into that?"
7IN,7IN_114,A2,"I don’t think we’ve looked into that that much, no."
7IN,7IN_115,Q,"So gender diversity has been debated for a while. How do you feel about the recent inclusion of ethnicity, sexual orientation - good, it’s not there?"
7IN,7IN_116,A2,Ethnicity is -
7IN,7IN_117,Q,"Ethnicity’s there, but sexual orientation is also sort of being included."
7IN,7IN_118,A1,"Yep, rightly so."
7IN,7IN_119,Q,"Does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others, do you think? And if so, why?"
7IN,7IN_12,A2,Commerce and law.
7IN,7IN_120,A1,"Well, again, I’m probably influenced by my organisation’s approach to this question, but the gender diversity seemed to be the highest level issue of concern five years ago, and now we’ve evolved where we realise it’s - and we always realised this, but we now think it’s greater than gender diversity. But if you’re asking me to pick the different points of diversity and what’s the most important, I’d still say it’s gender."
7IN,7IN_121,Q,Why is that?
7IN,7IN_122,A1,"Because we’re not quite where we need to be. When we are, then we can say that something is of greater importance of that. But I don’t think -it’s not a pick one question for me either. You can work on gender diversity, and ethnicity, and age, and skills, and sexual orientation."
7IN,7IN_123,Q,"And I guess gender diversity because of the data, you’ve got data, so it’s easier for you, as an organisation, to use it in terms of your -"
7IN,7IN_124,A1,"I don’t know if it’s even that. It’s in your everyday experience. Any time you go to a meeting, and I’ve had numerous meetings in this room with seven people from a client and their advisors, and including me, there’s seven males and one female. Now, 15 years ago, I probably would have thought there’s nothing unusual about that. But now, I think this is weird. How is it that this room ends up having seven males and one female talking about this thing. So it went from - I mean, I’m of a certain generation, Secondary participant’s of a different generation, but it went from your experience in a workplace in the 1990s were a particular type of experience. And they’re a different type of experience now."
7IN,7IN_125,A1,"But I think anyone of my generation - I’m not saying that we’re the first generation, but of any generation, over time, it’s just - you’re struck more by what you see, even as a male, that seems to be circumstances, like gender diversity. I’ve had other experiences. Secondary participant beat out three other males for his position. I’ll let you know, Secondary participant, I wanted females in my candidate pool, but I didn’t get any. And I was, ‘Where are the females for this role?’ They just didn’t step forward. I could have delayed the whole hiring process until I got - and sometimes that would happen. I’d say to my boss, ‘Look, I can’t go forward with the hire at this point because I don’t have any female candidates. I have to go and get me a recruiter to go and get me some female candidates to look at.’ But I didn’t do it with Secondary participant’s appointment, because it was more urgent, and I wasn’t using a recruiter in the first place, I was using the university job board. Which is pretty democratic. You’re allowed to see it and apply. Did it say something about females attitude to what they think I might have been as a boss? I don’t know."
7IN,7IN_126,Q,ASX?
7IN,7IN_127,A1,"Yeah, it sounded like a boy’s club to me."
7IN,7IN_128,Q,<Laughs> You need to change the image of ASX.
7IN,7IN_129,A1,We’ve never had a female chief executive either.
7IN,7IN_13,Q,"Commerce and law. You’re both males, and you’re both with ASX. ASX, it influences the for profit and has nothing to do with the not-for-profit, is that correct?"
7IN,7IN_130,Q,"<Laughs> We’ve already said that. Now I want to talk about board functioning, which really goes back to one female in the room. We want to understand how diversity influences board functioning. Do you feel that there are particular board functions that diversity can really help with? And can you give me an example?"
7IN,7IN_131,A1,"Sorry, can you repeat the question?"
7IN,7IN_132,Q,"Do you feel that there are particular board functions that diversity can really help with, whether it’s gender or others, and can you give me an example?"
7IN,7IN_133,A1,"I haven’t really attended too many board meetings in my life, and I’ve sat on one not-for-profit board for a number of years, so I’m going to say what I’ve heard others say rather than what has truly been my experience. But I’ve heard more than one male who’s been on numerous different boards say that when they are on boards that are all male, the dynamic is completely different than if there are females represented on the board, and the dynamic is more productive and collaborative when there are females on the board. Because the testosterone is obviously reduced, there is more careful regard to proper manners. But there’s also, sometimes - and you can probably generalise here, but this is what people have said - is that the females on the board bring a different perspective. They maybe have sometimes better ways of communicating than the men, diffusing disagreement. Not to say, ‘Let’s all find a way to agree and not have the right debate about a subject’, but it’s just done in a more productive way. I’ve thought that’s of interest, because I’ve heard that a number of times. I don’t know if that’s come through in your interviewing of others, but -"
7IN,7IN_134,A2,"I think as a specific example as well, I remember reading in the Ansell Annual Report, Ansell Limited, the latex rubber provider, they do specifically focus on age diversity, and also getting directors to serve limited sentences just to bring new insights into the company and innovations. Like that’s another example of how diversity adds or improves the functions of the board."
7IN,7IN_135,Q,"Yeah, okay. That’s good. This question really came out of the pilot. It wasn’t in the pilot of five, so you’re my first post pilot. Because some different things people said, so I thought we need to drill down on this."
7IN,7IN_136,A1,Sure. It’s a good question.
7IN,7IN_137,Q,"And then conversely, do you think - there might be some board functions that this kind of decision process is actually bad for. It limits or undermines, do you think? Have you heard that, that sort of problem solving -"
7IN,7IN_138,A1,Limits or undermines?
7IN,7IN_139,Q,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_14,A1,"That is very correct. Quick observation there, the history of these corporate governance principles, when we first produced them in 2003, immediately an area of interest that we attracted with that, which was a little unexpected, was the not-for-profits -"
7IN,7IN_140,A1,I suppose it could in some ways. In what ways is not occurring to me.
7IN,7IN_141,Q,And you haven’t heard this - because you’re drawing from what you’ve heard.
7IN,7IN_142,A1,"Well, if I can again just borrow from other people and their views, I suppose over time, there have been a fewer number, but they’re there. There will be people who say, ‘This is all a load of boloney. It’s not going to help me sell widgets, or make a profit, or do anything that’s going to add real value. If I can have a board that looks great with all the right diversity and stuff, it won’t make any difference to anything. In fact, it’s just a waste of my time.’"
7IN,7IN_143,Q,"Yeah, so it’s like, it’s irrelevant."
7IN,7IN_144,A1,"It’s irrelevant, yep."
7IN,7IN_145,Q,"It’s not going to undermine, it’s just irrelevant."
7IN,7IN_146,A1,"It might undermine to the extent that I have to go off and have board evaluation meetings, or do different things that is just time taken away from making widgets and that’s -"
7IN,7IN_147,Q,"We all hear that when we work in the area of quality or whatever, anything to do with being accountable and transparent about your processes. That’s great. Okay. There’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and board functioning. I’d like to drill down a bit on that. Do you feel that cognitive diversity influences a board functioning, and is there a positive or negative influence? Perhaps it depends."
7IN,7IN_148,A1,"Secondary participant, you’ll know what cognitive diversity is. What is it?"
7IN,7IN_149,A2,I wouldn’t know.
7IN,7IN_15,Q,Really?
7IN,7IN_150,Q,"The way I’m using it here, draws from some people who talk about it as different approaches to problem solving, which you’ve talked about, different perspectives, different information processing styles, which you’ve referred to. So swish term is cognitive diversity."
7IN,7IN_151,A1,"Okay, yep. So cognitive diversity is - sorry, the question you asked again?"
7IN,7IN_152,Q,"Does it influence board functioning, which you’ve sort of already indicated it does, in a positive, negative, or it depends sort of way?"
7IN,7IN_153,A1,"I think, again, it would be great to have all of the evidence in on this question, but maybe to think about our organisation, and in my team, and other teams. We’re a company that’s been in business for 150 years probably, but we’re using technology more and more in our business, and there’s more and more opportunities for us to develop more technology, and it’s all very exciting. But it means that we’ve got people with finance backgrounds, and legal backgrounds, and management backgrounds, and technology background, and marketing backgrounds and other backgrounds that we haven’t actually had people from those backgrounds before."
7IN,7IN_154,A1,"And we suspect that when we get them all into a room, they’re all going to have different perspectives, and we’re going to produce some great things. Other times, we’re going to have a complete failure to communicate and it will all not work out as well as we’d hoped. But senior management’s absolute belief is that if we have more diversity in our teams, we’re going to get new products, exciting developments, we just need to be mindful that we have a licence to operate a stock exchange that needs us to absolutely mission critical on all the systems, get everything right, have a really attuned risk culture around risk management. And sometimes those things are just about boring people like me who know that’s the process and we stick to that process. So maybe don’t take me to a creative meeting and come up with lots of great new products, but our managing director he knows he needs people like me, he needs people like Secondary participant, and he needs other people with other things."
7IN,7IN_155,Q,"That’s good. I’m thinking also then, you’ve alluded to how to avoid miscommunication. The role of the chair, or someone in facilitating the conversation so as the things that have to be absolutely right, this has to be risk assured, so we can’t try too much innovation here, this is compromise -"
7IN,7IN_156,A1,"Yes, correct."
7IN,7IN_157,Q,"So how the chair - in the board, it’s the chair - might manage this. What kind of processes or skills do you think they need to manage this diversity?"
7IN,7IN_158,A1,"Well, they’d probably, I suppose, if I think about chairman, they need to have terrific wisdom, a lot of experience, and be good at a lot of things. But also, give over some of their control to others that they know are going to be better at doing so. Our company’s got new business developments, that would involve people who are taking control, and they report back to the board, ‘This is our progress along the path of this business.’ And the board will say, ‘That’s great. Keep doing that’, or, ‘We don’t like where that’s going.’"
7IN,7IN_159,Q,"That’s a good way of managing - like having subcommittees, so then the whole meeting’s not overcome by this creative - so you have subcommittee formation, and they feedback to the board."
7IN,7IN_16,A1,"Yeah, because as long ago as back then, if we were to do a public seminar for our stakeholders, being our listed companies in investors, from the back of the room there would be, ‘Well, this is all great, but how am I going to adopt this for my charity organisation’ or ‘How is this going to work?’ And I would say, ‘Well, with due respect, I don’t know. It wasn’t intended to -"
7IN,7IN_160,A1,"I’m not saying anything you couldn’t read in our reports that we put out publicly, but it’s no secret that we’ve got some new business initiatives. If we had a culture at the top of our organisation that said it wanted to do new business initiatives but actually, when it started to do them, completely caused an inability for those people to actually do the things that are needed to create new business, they would walk away and they’d say, ‘It’s just all too hard.’ And no one’s doing that, so we’re making progress. And in deep, we’re replacing a legacy system which is very important infrastructure with a new technology blockchain, which is quite interesting. So we’re feeling that we want to use a technology that no other stock exchange has used, and we think it can work for us. And it’s not just a new business initiative, it’s actually replacing the Chet system, which is a key part of our infrastructure for our business. We probably demonstrate some of those attitudes to being open to change. To produce that new technology we need to hire a lot of new people."
7IN,7IN_161,Q,"And that’s similar to the ABC, moving to a digital platform, it needed a whole lot of new people, and possibly contributed to some of the -"
7IN,7IN_162,A1,"Yeah. As I said, I think I said in my opening remark, the world, business wise, there’s so much disruption, so much change, speed of change, technology. You couldn’t possibly just stay the way you are and think that your business will go on as it has in the past."
7IN,7IN_163,Q,"Your organisation doesn’t do anything to cultivate new board members, that’s relevant to other institutions, isn’t it? Except for your standards -"
7IN,7IN_164,A1,"Yeah, I think there would be something in there that talks about -"
7IN,7IN_165,Q,"Yeah, there are. Sorry. Can you think of any ways that your organisation helps candidates from minority groups? We’ll look at this. Because I want to move to the regulating, which is the last three questions."
7IN,7IN_166,A1,"Yeah, sure."
7IN,7IN_167,Q,"What do you see is the main barriers to building diverse boards in Australia? And how do they work, these barriers?"
7IN,7IN_168,A1,"The barriers, yeah. Well, I think one of the barriers would be that it’s all fine to think that boards can become more diverse, but any appointment of any board person to a board is based around the needs of that business and what the shareholders want from their investment in that business. It gets down to those simple considerations. So it would be preferable, or else equal, to hire the younger female, who doesn’t have an Anglo-Saxon background, and has some really good experience in technology and marketing onto the board of my staid old company. But I’ve got another candidate who’s not those things but is other things, and he’s male, and he’s older, and I evaluate that. And I think well, what will my shareholders make of it if they find out that I had the opportunity to hire that person onto my board, but I hired the other person, who doesn’t have any experience, who I think could be great, but it feels like a bit of a risk to me. It’s not just a risk that I’m allowed to take on my own behalf, I’ve got shareholders. So I would think that’s probably something that would weigh -"
7IN,7IN_169,Q,So is that like shareholder’s perception of risk -
7IN,7IN_17,Q,"That’s interesting. There’s a question later about how you actually influence your stakeholders, who are the for profits, you influence the not-for-profits."
7IN,7IN_170,A1,"I think so, yeah -"
7IN,7IN_171,Q,Which you might be willing to take the risk -
7IN,7IN_172,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_173,Q,But to sell it to your shareholders is difficult?
7IN,7IN_174,A1,"Not even to sell it to them, just to know that your obligations are to them. They may never even know, but - if I’m the theoretical or hypothetical chairman of the board of this company, it’s not my plaything, I’ve got these responsibilities. It’s not just up to me."
7IN,7IN_175,Q,What do your guidelines do to help manage that barrier?
7IN,7IN_176,A1,"Well, I don’t think they talk specifically to that. They do -  I mean, I used that as one example, there’s probably ten others you can think of. It’s just the people will recognise these barriers or they won’t recognise them, I guess. They’re just there as barriers."
7IN,7IN_177,Q,Were they there five years ago?
7IN,7IN_178,A1,"Yeah, I would imagine so."
7IN,7IN_179,Q,And it still hasn’t changed?
7IN,7IN_18,A1,"Like it or not, anything put out in a public forum like this, which gathers the views of a lot of different people, it attracts great interest, great buy-in, included by people that it wasn’t even intended for, which said to me one thing, which was there was clearly a void there, that they were looking for anything to fashion into what they needed it to be fashioned in to. But if you look on the ASX website, the submissions on the most recent revisions - and I haven’t done this myself - but you’re likely to see amongst all the submitters, you’re probably going to see some not-for-profits and some people maybe with just their particular agenda item that they want to progress through our consideration."
7IN,7IN_180,A1,"Well, the numbers are changing. And what I think has changed is this document is pretty impactful. People don’t ignore much in this. Some will do it better than others, but it won’t be ignored. So the new words that talk about wider diversity, the new words in the fourth edition, will have an impact. People will ask questions this year, and the year after, and the year after that about -because the council reconvenes, so they will have another meeting sometime next year, they’ll have another meeting later next year, they’ll have further meetings, there’ll be a fifth edition. And what would be particularly considered is those things that we changed for the fourth edition, how did that work out? So I think it will become absolutely an area of greater focus. But as I’ve said before, I think most people are inclined to the view that greater diversity on boards is going to produce better outcomes."
7IN,7IN_181,Q,"And this attitude of concern about risk and duty, that conservative view, that is being perhaps brought into question, or you’re allowed to set it aside somewhat because these standards are saying, ‘Diversity’s good.’"
7IN,7IN_182,A1,"I don’t even know that you set them aside. Your question earlier was what would be a barrier? I think that would be a barrier. I mean, each of these principles has some interconnectedness. But you could argue, I suppose, that if you were to jump in too enthusiastically into board diversity per this principle, that you could affect your risk management under one of the other principles, especially if you’re operating a bank and you decided that you wanted to appoint four new persons to your bank board who didn’t have any banking experience."
7IN,7IN_183,Q,"Yeah, exactly. I’m just trying to see how I can move this here. You’re showing data, I guess, you’re publishing data that shows that more people have women on boards -"
7IN,7IN_184,A1,"Just to be clear, Secondary participant’s looked at the numbers, AICD is publishing data -"
7IN,7IN_185,Q,"Yep. Women on Boards do, and AICD, yep -"
7IN,7IN_186,A1,Yep.
7IN,7IN_187,Q,So the institutions that influence boards are publishing data -
7IN,7IN_188,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_189,Q,And you’re requiring that it’s reported so it’s able to then be captured and made public.
7IN,7IN_19,Q,I think it’s an interesting question. Can we just leave this as we talk through the questionnaire -
7IN,7IN_190,A1,Yep.
7IN,7IN_191,Q,"So there’s a general, then, awareness of diversity and the world hasn’t collapsed."
7IN,7IN_192,A1,Hmm.
7IN,7IN_193,Q,And shareholders haven’t walked away.
7IN,7IN_194,A1,Hmm.
7IN,7IN_195,Q,"So being the lonely person out there, taking risk on their own, is scary, but when everyone’s, ‘Well, this is the norm now.’ So this starts to lose power, this barrier."
7IN,7IN_196,A1,Hmm.
7IN,7IN_197,Q,"I guess what I’m trying to - you have labelled, like a barrier of thinking, and how this is being influenced or shaped is through, in part, your regulations, which say people have to document this. And then other organisations that influence boards, which will say publicise it, and it becomes hard to sustain that when someone on the board can say, ‘Well, hang on, 40% of the people in ASX200 are female, so how can you say it’s a high risk. We’ve only got two.’"
7IN,7IN_198,A1,"It would become a high risk if you maintained an all-male board, I would have thought."
7IN,7IN_199,Q,"Turn it around, yeah."
7IN,7IN_2,A1,Yep.
7IN,7IN_20,A1,"Sure. I didn’t want to distract, I just thought an interesting-"
7IN,7IN_200,A1,"You could turn it around, yeah."
7IN,7IN_201,Q,"So do you feel that new board member selection is an issue, or not, in terms of managing diversity?"
7IN,7IN_202,A1,"Well, an issue inasmuch as -"
7IN,7IN_203,Q,"It’s preventing it, like it’s a barrier to building diversity?"
7IN,7IN_204,A1,I’m not sure.
7IN,7IN_205,Q,"You don’t have to think so. We can leave it. I’m thinking it’s better for a board member anyway, probably."
7IN,7IN_206,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_207,Q,"From a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of Australian boards is currently being promoted? How do you feel about the use of gender targets, for example, and quotas to influence board diversity?"
7IN,7IN_208,A1,"Well, I think that the principles are saying, ‘for those of you not using numerical targets, you need to really explain why that is.’ I think some people use numerical targets for executive - in some ways, it’s probably a bit easier to my way of thinking, to set your targets for board diversity than it is senior management. That’s where it gets difficult, because you won’t necessarily have roles within your company that succession planning, or any kind of planning made it possible that meeting whatever benchmark whatever you wanted to set could actually be achieved. Especially if it’s in an organisation like us, where there’s some specialised roles where you’re unlikely to get people from outside who can do the role as well as two or three people from within the organisation."
7IN,7IN_209,A1,"And if those three people are each male, then that’s probably going to be a senior appointment of a male, or it could be females. Not always. We’re relatively diverse within our organisation. So I think it wouldn’t just be our company, but I think a lot of companies would - I mean, if you were just trying to meet the targets, if you just wanted to be able to meet the targets, make those appointments, you’d probably - you could appoint a director from outside to fill a non-executive role relatively easily. It’s the internal appointments, or the appointments to fill management roles that sometimes -"
7IN,7IN_21,Q,"No, no. A question’s come to me, how these interact, like how your guidelines, written for the for-profits, not for the not-for-profits, how that might, now that you’re consciously aware you can’t ignore it, how you think, if you know, if you think it would have influence, and why you think they might be influenced or be interested. It would just be useful for me to get that perception. We may as well flag it now, and as we go through the questions, if you sort of - yeah, okay, we won’t ignore that sector now that we know that we do influence them."
7IN,7IN_210,Q,"So I think we really should be looking back there - I mean we are, we haven’t excluded it. But I’m just thinking in our questions, I might specify that."
7IN,7IN_211,A1,"And then you’re talking about what are the blockers, what are the things there, because there’s a whole different conversation to be had -"
7IN,7IN_212,Q,"Exactly. Like university courses, and -"
7IN,7IN_213,A1,"University courses, about childcare, about parental leave. All the little two percenters and three percenters that add up to - young mother says, ‘I’m going to take a career break here. The childcare’s not working out. My two toddlers, they’re not happy in childcare. I’m going to take a two year break.’ Then how are they going to get that senior management role when they return to work in three years’ time. Unless there’s some sort of positive discrimination."
7IN,7IN_214,Q,Exactly. They’ve lost it.
7IN,7IN_215,A1,"It becomes really complex when you start to delve into it. I’d like to see some sort of research of - I don’t know, 1000 Australian families across different industries and just delve into the real experiences of those people."
7IN,7IN_216,Q,"Families of industries, you mean families of CEOs of the industries, or -"
7IN,7IN_217,A1,Just families - what is ANZ Bank doing right or wrong that their outcomes on diversity are these. It’s their parental leave policy.
7IN,7IN_218,Q,"Okay, just got you."
7IN,7IN_219,A1,"Just nice, and it looks great, but is it actually achieving something in terms of those people who are at ANZ who are mothers, or fathers for that matter, getting back into the ANZ workforce in a really meaningful way and saying, ‘There you go, there were three promotions in the last 12 months from people who had - and interview them. I don’t know. ‘How did it work for you?’"
7IN,7IN_22,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_220,Q,What were the barriers?
7IN,7IN_221,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_222,Q,And what got you up there.
7IN,7IN_223,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_224,Q,"Yeah, exactly. I guess also, we’ve got low socioeconomic groups, and university fees, like scholarships. This is a serious fee paying -"
7IN,7IN_225,A1,House prices.
7IN,7IN_226,Q,"Yeah, exactly."
7IN,7IN_227,A1,Superannuation.
7IN,7IN_228,Q,So there’s these kinds of financial and social -
7IN,7IN_229,A1,"It’s almost too mindboggling to start as a researcher. I’m not saying, ‘Hey, researcher, go and do that.’"
7IN,7IN_23,Q,We’ll make it conscious -
7IN,7IN_230,Q,"But there’s a lot of other research that’s done that can feed into it, do you know what I mean?"
7IN,7IN_231,A1,Hmm.
7IN,7IN_232,Q,"It’s social research, which is what this is. So before the regulation, before the counting of women, I can track that, it wasn’t very - it’s been effective, hasn’t it? In terms of the proportion of women on boards, we said that at the beginning -"
7IN,7IN_233,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_234,Q,"Because it was a government policy, wasn’t it?"
7IN,7IN_235,A1,"No, it wasn’t at all."
7IN,7IN_236,Q,I thought Penny Wong?
7IN,7IN_237,A1,"I’ll stand corrected here, but I’m pretty sure that the ALP has had policies and targets and quotas. I’m pretty sure that in corporate life in Europe there have been quotas and targets. And I’m pretty sure there’s never been a mandated quota or target -"
7IN,7IN_238,Q,Here in Australia?
7IN,7IN_239,A1,At a corporate level anywhere in Australia.
7IN,7IN_24,A1,"I think we’ve had to - when I say ‘we’, it’s worth remembering that the corporate governance principles are produced by a great number of different industry groups and organisations who get around the table and debate these things, and what ends up being the document is a consensus view on different things, but not every single group agrees wholeheartedly with each and every point. But it’s a consensus. I think the council has continued to be careful to provide this guidance for the particular group that it’s aimed at, and it’s not for everybody, and it’s not for not-for-profits."
7IN,7IN_240,Q,Okay.
7IN,7IN_241,A1,I stand corrected.
7IN,7IN_242,Q,And yours are just -
7IN,7IN_243,A1,Disclosure based.
7IN,7IN_244,Q,Disclosure based. Name and shame.
7IN,7IN_245,A1,Tell us what you’re going to do.
7IN,7IN_246,A2,"There is the workplace standard quality acts as well, which requires the same things that we do as well. It’s just the disclosure of. But it’s not necessary. If they want to be acknowledged as a Workplace Gender Equality Act company, then they do the [unclear]01:03:33 work."
7IN,7IN_247,Q,"So you’re rewarded, like La Trobe is."
7IN,7IN_248,A1,"Yep. In saying that, I did, in preparation for this interview, I did come across some new words that talked about a target, 30%. If you keyword search 30% in this document you’ll find it. I highlighted it."
7IN,7IN_249,Q,"Yep, I’ll look it up. Okay."
7IN,7IN_25,Q,"So you wouldn’t invite them to the table, for example."
7IN,7IN_250,A1,"Yeah, here we go."
7IN,7IN_251,Q,"Oh, good on you."
7IN,7IN_252,A1,"At the end of recommendation 1.5, just above the paragraph that begins, Commentary, it says, if the entity was in the [SMPA6300]01:04:21 at the commencement of the reporting period, the measurable objective for achieving gender diversity in the composition of its board, should be to have no less than 30% of its directors of each gender within a specified period. So that’s saying, if you’re a top 300 company, you’re going to have to have a target of 30% female, or 30% male if you’re dominated by females, I suppose."
7IN,7IN_253,Q,"And when you say, ‘should in this form’, what does it do? Is that like what you were saying earlier? Is that, ‘You have to tell me how you’re going to get it up to that.’"
7IN,7IN_254,A1,"Well, you should. But if you don’t, you don’t. You should."
7IN,7IN_255,Q,"Okay, so this is not the must."
7IN,7IN_256,A1,"It’s baby steps, but you know, that’s progress. That’s the first time it’s ever been written into the principles."
7IN,7IN_257,Q,"Okay, so watch that space. That’s a key one -"
7IN,7IN_258,A1,"Yeah, because I would think that there would be shareholder groups over time, if not even from next year, who will go to AGMs and say, ‘The fourth edition said 30% is a target. Now you’ve never set any targets. Where’s your 30%, because you don’t have it now. What are you going to do about it?’ That would be a conversation at AGMs for sure."
7IN,7IN_259,Q,Brilliant.
7IN,7IN_26,A1,"No. Well, when I say ‘we’, you’ll see who is at the table. So ASX logo on the front cover is the leader in bringing the people together, established it all those years ago in 2002. I mean, again, maybe I won’t go on about this, but back in 2002, it was maybe perceived that corporate Australia, with the boards on listed companies, must have had all the answers, and must operate with the best governance practices you could find. And then, of course, we saw the GFC and we saw the banking royal commission, and probably everyone was feeling less assured about that."
7IN,7IN_260,A1,"Yeah, there’s a lot to watch that will come out from this."
7IN,7IN_261,Q,"So I should search ‘must’, ‘should’, in this document, I reckon."
7IN,7IN_262,A1,"Advisable. Yeah, and it also marks up. So you’ll see the mark ups, and you’ll see the explanation for why the language changed. A lot of this was about words, and a lot of debate was had, and a lot of consternation about different words and how they were used. If they had a legal meaning. And look at the submissions. It would be a good cure for insomnia. Some of the submissions from the Law Council and other interest groups will say, ‘You can’t use that word. That has been used in courts to convict people of this. This is guideline.’ So there’s a lot of debate about different things -"
7IN,7IN_263,Q,"Okay, on language?"
7IN,7IN_264,A1,Yep.
7IN,7IN_265,Q,"Okay, finally, ten years into the future, how would you like to see the diversity of Australian boards?"
7IN,7IN_266,A1,"Well, I suppose what I wouldn’t want to see is every board sitting on 30% female representation, because it might suggest that everyone ticked boxes and nobody actually engaged with it. I would probably expect and hope to see diversity of diversity, so we will see eight person boards with six females, and eight person boards who are six males, and every other possibility, including a small oil and gas company with four males, it might be difficult to change that. And that would be understood and accepted by me, if not others."
7IN,7IN_267,Q,"Yep, okay. What do you think needs to be done for this to happen?"
7IN,7IN_268,A1,"I go back to my point, which is in some ways it’s relatively easy to fix gender diversity on boards, and the numbers have improved. The greater challenges are within management, and their tomorrow’s directors, and they’ll be arguably good directors, especially if they have that management experience. Because - and I didn’t read Graeme Samuel’s comments last week, and I know he’s tried to clarify his comments, but they probably were a bit wide of the mark, but I don’t think Graeme Samuel said this, but others have observed that with some directors, their experience - if they’re female directors, sometimes they’re male, but sometimes they’re female, is that their experience is being a lawyer or an accountant or a consultant, not experienced within the industry on the board that they sit."
7IN,7IN_269,A1,"And there’s a perception that there’s some potential weakness in that skill that brought to the board. It’s all fine to have a lawyer or an accountant and their background experience, that’s great. But it would be, to some people’s way of thinking, better if boards were comprised of people with experience, especially in the industry that that business operates, or in other industries that don’t typically attract people onto boards. And so that might be helped by having more diversity at the management level, for those people to then move through and become directors in the future, in ten years’ time, when they’ve had great experience within that particular business or businesses rather than having that broad experience but not deep experience necessarily if they’re a lawyer or accountant by background."
7IN,7IN_27,Q,"Is that why ASX came to be, out of that -"
7IN,7IN_270,Q,"Okay, well, that’s a good one to end on, I think. And I like that moving back up, or down management. The tomorrow’s directors, that’s where we need to look."
7IN,7IN_271,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_272,Q,"And your point earlier, which I must pick up in the transcript, is linking it to barriers within management, senior management at the moment is really important."
7IN,7IN_273,A1,Hmm.
7IN,7IN_274,Q,"There’s research on that, so just link to that."
7IN,7IN_275,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_276,Q,"Well, thank you so much. That was fantastic."
7IN,7IN_277,A1,No problem at all. Thank you.
7IN,7IN_278,Q,I look forward to - <ends abruptly>
7IN,7IN_28,A1,"No. Well, I think history is fascinating, so I’m very happy to talk more history."
7IN,7IN_29,Q,I’m happy.
7IN,7IN_3,Q,"And then, of course, we consider it a pilot, but it will be a good start. So yeah. Thank you very much, Main participant (A1)and Secondary participant (A2) for agreeing to be interviewed  for this research. Because I’ve got both of you here at the same time, you’ve got different sounding voices, that will help the transcriber. So Main participant, could you say something?"
7IN,7IN_30,A1,"In 2003, the first principles were produced, and they were produced because the council was convened in 2002. And the reason it was convened in 2002 was there was some corporate scandals -"
7IN,7IN_31,Q,HIH.
7IN,7IN_32,A1,"There  was HIH. And in the US there was Enron, and there was a very, by most peoples’ points of view, a relatively extreme legislative response to corporate governance failings in the US with Sarbanes Oxley, and ASX was in a position where it was maybe called upon to do something, and we thought it was right to do something, to set out some principles. Because there was nothing, there was absolutely nothing. And we recognised with our companies, large and small, that a set of principles that’s disclosure based was going to be preferable to sitting back doing nothing and having the government of the day say, ‘Why don’t we have some legislation applied to this.’ And we thought that may not have been a very good thing. So we thought, we’ve got to fill the breach here, we’ve got to step up. I think was the right call by us. Most people think - I’m sure all the people around the table who produced these principles would think the same."
7IN,7IN_33,Q,"Thank you. That gives me a really good understanding of the principles. Because I’ve looked at the third, because they were available, and the fourth, I’ve just been looking to see what the difference is."
7IN,7IN_34,A1,"You don’t always get that background. The internet’s been around a while, but in 2001, it didn’t have a whole lot on it."
7IN,7IN_35,Q,"No, it didn’t. Exactly. So no, it’s really valuable, thank you. It gives a backline understanding. Anyway, there’s a lot of talk about board diversity, but we’re interested to hear from people like you, who represent organisations that influence boards. So your responses to questions can be from the position of ASX, or your personal position. If you want to -"
7IN,7IN_36,A1,I’ll be careful to say which position I’m occupying though.
7IN,7IN_37,Q,"Yeah, please do that, and that will be fine. But the transcript is deidentified, of course. So does that mean if you’re speaking from ASX, we need to deidentify it?"
7IN,7IN_38,A1,I’ll only say if I’m speaking on my own behalf and not ASX’s. I’m mostly going to be ASX.
7IN,7IN_39,Q,"So if you’re ASX, do you want that deidentified, or do you want it identified?"
7IN,7IN_4,A1,"Yes, I’m Main participant. I’m the manager of the listings team in Melbourne."
7IN,7IN_40,A1,I’m not sure what I want.
7IN,7IN_41,Q,Tell me that at the end after you know what you’ve said.
7IN,7IN_42,A1,"Yep. I’m at liberty to represent ASX responsibly and well, so I don’t need to be deidentified. But, I mean, are most of your interviewees deidentified?"
7IN,7IN_43,Q,"Well, yes, because they’re people, they’re board directors. We say, ‘We’ll deidentify you.’ But I’m just thinking because you’re an institution and the role you’ve played historically, you may want to be identified. But we can leave it with your principles identifying you. I’ll refer to the documents and that will identify you."
7IN,7IN_44,A1,"Let’s do that. Your report wouldn’t be complete if it didn’t look to these principles, so -"
7IN,7IN_45,Q,"Exactly. So first, how are the composition of boards that you’re familiar with changed over time in terms of diversity? Has it increased, decreased?"
7IN,7IN_46,A1,"I’m a little influenced by what I read in newspapers, like everyone else, but I think I’m right in saying, Secondary participant, and from my own research over the years and presentations that I’ve done, that there is probably no doubt that there are more females on boards. AICD have a - you can go to their website and I’m sure it’s there right now. It will have a ‘this year, last year, three years ago, five years ago,’ and the numbers don’t lie. Graeme Samuel might suggest that the numbers do lie, because it’s the same women on each board. But there was an article this morning from the Chief Executive Women, managing director, who said, ‘He’s got his numbers wrong. There is more diversity. Not just amongst women on boards, but amongst men as well.’ I’m not as across those numbers, but there’s no question there’s more diversity on boards."
7IN,7IN_47,Q,So there’s more gender diversity-
7IN,7IN_48,A1,Correct.
7IN,7IN_49,Q,What about other kinds of diversity?
7IN,7IN_5,Q,Fantastic. And Secondary participant.
7IN,7IN_50,A1,"We, the principles focus particularly on gender diversity, because it seemed to be a key issue to address, with some urgency. But what I don’t think our principles would require people to bring forward in their disclosure, so it’s not going to be evident, necessarily, from the disclosures that we call on, is to saying, ‘What’s your age diversity like? What’s your skills diversity like?’ People are reporting on their board skills matrixes, so we’re going to have better understanding of what skills there are on boards. That would help to further the understanding. But diversity beyond gender diversity, I think it’s a bit of a - we’ve still got a [unclear]00:11:55, we’ll have a lot more to do, I suppose, to look at that. But I think the answer - I wouldn’t guess at what the answer is. People would probably say that there’s a lack of diversity on other measures as well as gender. But I haven’t done the research myself."
7IN,7IN_51,Q,Why do you think ASX doesn’t measure things other than gender?
7IN,7IN_52,A1,"The view was taken, and I think this is made clear in some of the - certainly the third principles, and it would be reemphasised, I suspect, in these principles. Although, in the new updated principles, we do talk now about greater diversity. If you look at the third, and probably the second. The first principles in 202 probably said nothing about gender diversity, would be my guess. The second would have said something, and the third would have said more, and the fourth is now expanding. And I highlighted it actually."
7IN,7IN_53,Q,"I got diversity in one policy. In recommendation 2.1, that the nomination committee ensures that the board has appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience and its diversity."
7IN,7IN_54,A1,"I’m thinking if you look at the bottom of page 10, so just before box 1.5. This is in recommendation 1.5, there’s a box 1.5, and right before that box it says, the council would also recommend that boards of listed entities consider other facets of diversity in addition to gender when considering the composition of the board, in particular, having directors of different ages, ethnicities and backgrounds."
7IN,7IN_55,Q,That’s fantastic. I missed that one.
7IN,7IN_56,A1,"That’s the next frontier, I suppose. Gender was just deliberately focused on as, I think, something that people thought required urgent attention."
7IN,7IN_57,Q,"Yep, beautiful. It’s going to be a challenge to measure them, but you’re looking at measuring perspectives, decision making, are you, or something?"
7IN,7IN_58,A2,Not quite. What we do look at from ASX is the reporting that they do in regards to gender diversity.
7IN,7IN_59,Q,"Just gender diversity, yep, okay. K"
7IN,7IN_6,A2,"Hi, I’m Secondary participant, and I’m a graduate at ASX listings compliance."
7IN,7IN_60,A2,We don’t assess how effective -
7IN,7IN_61,Q,Skills matrix or something you were looking at. Main participant said something about you’re doing something in -
7IN,7IN_62,A2,"Yeah, specifically, I was looking at whether companies had established measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity. So an example would be having 30% of the board being comprised of females, or women. That was one of the things that we looked into. And what I did was more a service level analysis of ASX 200 entities. What we did find was that the majority of them, we had a sample size of about 159. The majority of them do have diversity objectives, but not necessarily measurable objectives. Sometimes we had a number of 39 entities that stated general objectives such as to increase the proportion of women as opposed to setting a static figure."
7IN,7IN_63,Q,"Sure, so it’s still focused on that."
7IN,7IN_64,A1,"And the fourth edition actually, called out this weaker disclosure against objectives, where it said, ‘Non numericalobjectives are great, and by all means report them, but don’t use them in place of numerical objectives.’ So the fourth edition has been a bit clearer on that."
7IN,7IN_65,Q,How did your organisation seek to influence Australian boards?
7IN,7IN_66,A1,"Bluntly - but only in a couple of areas. So going back to how the principles began at all, there were corporate scandals, in the US particularly, involved financial misreporting, and we’ve had some problems -isolated- but problems with financial reporting in Australia too. There was a big case involving Centro. So what we say is that you must have an audit committee that’s made up on non-executive directors, the majority of whom are independent. So you can’t have executives on your auditory committee. But we say that about our top 300 companies. We don’t say that about every company, because - going back to my earlier point, our market of 2200 listed entities includes very small entities with three person boards, mining explorers, bio techs, quite small companies that wouldn’t be listed on exchanges overseas."
7IN,7IN_67,A1,"So we’ve got a very broad section of companies, and so we think at the top end - and we know that investors think this too - there should be some more strict rules around board composition for remuneration committees and audit committees. And we say, ‘You just have to have that.’ So if a company fell out of compliance, if it had an audit committee that had the right composition but a director resigned from that board and we became aware of it, we would go to that company and say, ‘You must appoint a director who’s independent, non-executive, and have them on the audit committee. You must go do that.’ So that’s our role, and that’s what we say. That’s built into the listing rule. So it’s not just about a disclosure based principle, which is a good thing to do but not a must do. This entire document, for a smaller company, it’s all good things to do but not must dos."
7IN,7IN_68,Q,"But for the larger company, there are some musts in there?"
7IN,7IN_69,A1,Yes.
7IN,7IN_7,Q,"Great. Thanks, now the transcriber will be able to put your initials by what you say and I don’t have to keep indicting who’s who. We’re interested in the discipline background. I saw you on LinkedIn, and I think it’s law and commerce."
7IN,7IN_70,Q,"If they break a must, what can you do? What do you do?"
7IN,7IN_71,A1,"It might be the case that the company that’s not in compliance might say, ‘We need some time to organise this. How about we get back to you in three months’ time when we’ve shortlisted a candidate pool. And by within six months, we’ll have it all rearranged to your satisfaction.’ We would say, ‘That’s not quick enough for our liking. You need to move much more quickly than that.’ And our powers are only to suspect a company’s shares from trading, and then to delist the company if we thought that was necessary. That’s never come up with companies of the size that we’re talking about, obviously."
7IN,7IN_72,A1,"I don’t think we’ve ever had to suspend a company for not having compliant committees within its board structure for our requirements. But that is clearly after naming and shaming, so we might be moved to write to the company and say, ‘You’re not actually in compliance with this rule. Please advise when you will be.’ And there might be a response back. So that in itself would be something the company would not welcome, an ASX query that’s publicly disclosed. ASX identified a breach of a rule that is yet to be rectified, and the company have to explain a timeframe in which it will rectify that."
7IN,7IN_73,Q,"Okay, and as a shareholder, I would see that if I went on your site?"
7IN,7IN_74,A1,Yep.
7IN,7IN_75,Q,So it is public shaming.
7IN,7IN_76,A1,"But I wouldn’t suggest that that would be - that query process might have happened only a couple of times. Because companies are responsive to all of this at the larger end, and any company can lose a director and fall out of compliance with that rule. That’s understood. It’s just they need to get back into compliance in a prompt way. Responsibly, not employing the next director off the street. Go through the proper process, but we think that proper process ought to take only so much time."
7IN,7IN_77,Q,"Okay, so you have - the clout really comes from that, you have this potential risk or threat, so then it helps people to be proactive in using your guidelines."
7IN,7IN_78,A1,"Yeah. And these expectations are now understood. I mean, they were originally 17 years ago now, and over time, people have begun to realise that not only is it an ASX rules, their own investors, shareholders and others are totally expecting it as well."
7IN,7IN_79,Q,So how do you know that? How do you know shareholders expect this?
7IN,7IN_8,A2,And commerce.
7IN,7IN_80,A1,"Because we know that all of our companies - not all of them, but the majority of them at the larger end - have these engagements with shareholders and groups prior to their AGM. So when they come up to have elections for directors at the forthcoming AGM, they’ll sit down with shareholders, and sometimes with proxy advisors, so these proxy advisors will provide advice to whomever asks for it. Often they might be industry superfunds, or they might be offshore investors, and they’ll say, ‘I’ve got this enormous portfolio of investments. I can’t follow everything. You, proxy advisor, can you please provide me with a report on these companies, because I want to know how I should vote at the forthcoming AGM.’ And the advice might be back saying, ‘They’re doing a pretty good job. Tick a box on appointing all those directors for re-election’, or, ‘There are some issues of concern here. These are what we’ve found.’ And then it’s up to the investor whether they actually want to think, ‘Well, gee, I might make my feelings known by saying no to that director appointment.’ It’s up to them."
7IN,7IN_81,Q,"How important do you think it is to have a diverse board? If I was to give you a scale of 110, where 10 is extremely important, and 1 is not at all. Where would you put it?"
7IN,7IN_82,A1,"A diverse board, it would have to be 7 or higher, wouldn’t it? Probably for me it’s an 8."
7IN,7IN_83,Q,Do you want to have a voice?
7IN,7IN_84,A2,I think I’ll leave that to Main participant. <Laughs>
7IN,7IN_85,Q,"Do you feel that it’s always been important, and if this has always been the case?"
7IN,7IN_86,A1,"Well, I’ve given it an 8, so I rate it as important. I think some might say, ‘What are you saying, the only correct answer can be 10.’ I only ever give marks of 8 on most things, or lower. Well, it’s important these days - I mean, if we think about our company or we think about any company, the world’s never been an easy place to conduct business, but it’s an even more difficult place to conduct business with industry facing disruption in all these different areas, customers, different customer groups, different regulations, different skills that directors need. You can’t possibly have five white males aged between 45 and 60 who have all the answers. In fact, they’re going to have mostly the same answers to a lot of the questions. And so it would make sense that there’d be ethnic diversity, skill diversity, age diversity, and, of course, gender diversity. I think you could almost take that as a given."
7IN,7IN_87,Q,Yeah. It’s that complexity -
7IN,7IN_88,A1,Yeah.
7IN,7IN_89,A2,"Also on that point is that with smaller boards, it’s a little bit more difficult to achieve the gender diversity ratios than in larger boards as well. So there are some companies on the smaller end that do acknowledge the fact that they haven’t set any objectives just because of their size at the time."
7IN,7IN_9,Q,Yeah. And -
7IN,7IN_90,Q,"Do you think it varies with industries, are there some industries that are -"
7IN,7IN_91,A1,"Sure. You take oil and gas. I don’t know. I’m aware that there are a reasonable number of females going through the university studying geology, but becoming geologists and being miners, these are reasonable numbers, but they’re not big numbers. And if it’s oil and gas, it’s probably a lower representation of females again. So if I’m a small oil and gas company, I might find it actually really difficult to even find a suitable candidate to join my board. I might have a four person board, all male, all over 50, because try as I might, I couldn’t get great gender diversity, and maybe even diversity on the other measures within my world. It does depend on industry."
7IN,7IN_92,A1,"You’ll see in other industries, they lend themselves more easily to female. If we’re talking retail, or we’re talking health businesses - and the interesting thing for them is that sometimes they can tell a very good story around gender diversity, and these principles are kind of written to presume that everyone needs to improve their gender diversity, so what are your targets? And yet, if you’re kind of sitting at level where you like your diversity, you’re 50/50 on your board, or you might even be 60/40  to the female, you wouldn’t want to be improving that more, you might just want to maintain that. So what do you say in your objectives? You’re going to try and maintain it. It might be perfectly valid."
7IN,7IN_93,Q,"Yeah, sometimes change is not good. <Laughter> Do you think that there is any situation or context that might cause you to change your importance rating? So not now that you have your 60/40 or your 50/50, but the importance that diversity has. Is there anything uncertainty, high risk, uncertainty, anything?"
7IN,7IN_94,A1,"I was at a breakfast just last week, and we were chatting about this at another university actually, MacquarieUniversity, where I was a graduate in finance, and I actually was talking about this point. Because I must have been - I wasn’t specifically thinking about forthcoming interview, but it was probably in my head. And I said, ‘It would be great to get information, actual data that proves that better governed companies per these principles are actually definitely delivering, as can be seen from the data, definitely delivering better outcomes for shareholders in their returns. Because I’m not aware that there’s been that work done. And if the work was done and it proved it beyond doubt, then everyone would have to - and part of that was the diversity on boards- then what shareholder would stand against that, what person would stand against that? If it was - I mean, a lot of people think that socially it’s the right thing to do, or there’s other reasons to do it over and above or outside of shareholder returns, but if the shareholder returns are being produced by it, then the argument is largely done, I would have thought."
7IN,7IN_95,Q,"Yeah. Well, the evidence won’t be clear, I’m telling you that. <Laughter> That’s us, we’re looking for perceptions. There is no situation that you would change, except, like you’re saying, if there was evidence, evidence of financial gain for shareholders, that would be a mover."
7IN,7IN_96,A1,"I think so. But I think you’re right, it’s going to be very difficult to find the evidence, because you can’t have an experiment where you have ANZ wanting to have a completely male board and we’ll see how that goes. Westpac, why don’t you have 50/50 and let’s see how that goes. If you’re prepared to be in the experiment, we want to see how it goes."
7IN,7IN_97,Q,"<Laughs>Exactly. I can send you a really good review I found, if you want. Not on that, but would you be interested? Do you have time to read such things?"
7IN,7IN_98,A1,"Yeah, yeah."
7IN,7IN_99,Q,"Okay, it’s a review of a literature on performance. But it says there is no clear answer."
8IN,8IN_1,A,"I particularly enjoy working with senior people. Not because of hierarchy or status, but because they have the most impact for good and for bad. That's definitely where my focus is. Let me just - and we're all set."
8IN,8IN_10,Q,You have a psychology background?
8IN,8IN_100,Q,The individual leader.
8IN,8IN_101,A,"- why not me? By the way, I do a lot of work with young leaders and I love them. They are the hope of the world!"
8IN,8IN_102,Q,Uh-oh.
8IN,8IN_103,A,"No, they really are!"
8IN,8IN_104,Q,"Yeah, I love my nieces and nephews!"
8IN,8IN_105,A,"Yeah and so I think that that's really important. So, when you talk about age diversity, I think having them at the table - some of the best groups that I've run for example, back in YPO, where we have everyone from grandparents to these young adults where I had the whole gamut in the group. It's extraordinary because this group up here certainly understand that the world has changed so much, I can really, really learn from you; and if you have respect in the group that the millennials recognise that if you have role models in the group, gosh I can learn from you and your experience! So, that's a wonderful mix."
8IN,8IN_106,Q,"So, respect in the group is really key then?"
8IN,8IN_107,A,Totally. Respect and trust.
8IN,8IN_108,Q,How is that built?
8IN,8IN_109,A,Well -
8IN,8IN_11,A,"I do. But I kind of an eclectic - I'm not a registered psychologist, I'm qualified to be but I'm not. I just didn't go down that path, so how I think about my background is that it's quite eclectic in that originally it was philosophy and politics, then I went on and did post-grad in psych in the States and then in Queensland, at a post-graduate level. But I think my career has always been in that space of education and growth and human potentially really, and I've got a business background as well."
8IN,8IN_110,Q,This is board functioning.
8IN,8IN_111,A,"Yeah, board functioning. Having explicit rules of engagement is really important in that; why are we here?  What are we all signing up for? So if we focus on the process rather than - see, most board meetings are like 95% content and task, whereas I think the most important focus is to just to remind everyone about how we engage, everyone comes prepared, so it's about commitment, it's about respect for each other, it's about confidentiality, trust. All those elements, the rules of engagement have to be agreed to, they have to be explicit, we have to remind each other of them and call each other out; so, values and action. Very few boards pay attention to that. One rule of engagement could be; we're open to challenge. It's really about having a conversation all committed to why are we here. Having a positive impact. So, there's that. That's major important but even more important is who's at that table. Now, if you have people that are driven by their ego and their ambition, you might have a narcissist - and I think it's fair to say they are over represented at senior levels - that's tricky, but that can be managed by strong leadership. By a chair for example who is setting boundaries, who is holding the space, creating the safe space where people are able to contribute; so, it's all that stuff."
8IN,8IN_112,Q,"Oh, this is wonderful because -"
8IN,8IN_113,A,It's all there!
8IN,8IN_114,Q,-@ yeah exactly.
8IN,8IN_115,A,"No, I'm not saying it for that reason."
8IN,8IN_116,Q,"No, but -"
8IN,8IN_117,A,"But that's what I really believe in. It's about that, basically what we're talking about is that emotional maturity and that detachment from people's own egos and drives."
8IN,8IN_118,Q,"In your experience, how many boards in Australia - let me focus on that one - actually have values, let's call them values, and are rules and whatever values -"
8IN,8IN_119,A,Function optimally? Along those lines?
8IN,8IN_12,Q,Oh? That didn't come -
8IN,8IN_120,Q,"Yeah, that they actually make it explicit what their values are, so that the chair can then set boundaries."
8IN,8IN_121,A,I think very few.
8IN,8IN_122,Q,"Yeah, that's what I feared."
8IN,8IN_123,A,"Very few, it's crazy though. I can guarantee you that I could go into any board and not I, being I, Participant, but anyone that could in this space, could go in and draw most board's attention to this challenge of, are you just focussed on getting the work done or are you actually focussed on being optimal? And how do we really increase our impact and be of significance? It's the same with organisations. I get so excited when I find them, they do exist! And they -"
8IN,8IN_124,Q,"[Inaudible] 00:29:36 where is it, who creates it?"
8IN,8IN_125,A,"Well, always! Definitely and sometimes it can be a momentous task. But it's about the leadership."
8IN,8IN_126,Q,"What has come up in other interviews is that - when we talk about conflict or anything because that comes up in the board one, the director one - the chair does it, but there's nothing underneath that, nothing to -"
8IN,8IN_127,A,Yeah.
8IN,8IN_128,Q,- this is really what you're pointing out. You're saying this is what the Chair does.
8IN,8IN_129,A,"Yeah, but at the same time we have to have everyone - a distributed leadership as well -"
8IN,8IN_13,A,"Yeah, well I've had my own businesses."
8IN,8IN_130,Q,"Exactly, but set up a distributed model rather than a top down model."
8IN,8IN_131,A,"Yeah exactly, it is [unclear] 00:30:26 authoritative though and getting that buy-in and getting that engagement, and getting the vibrancy and making the meetings interesting and stimulating. But I think too, the other thing that we haven't mentioned is there's such a focus on just risk management now, rather than if you think about boards being focussed equally on perhaps strategy and risk management, I think it's unfortunately - I think we can tip - and that's once again that's because of the personalities sometimes of the board, lean very much into the risk management of it; which is absolutely vital. But not being strategic enough in terms of what are we seeing here? What is the - in terms of looking at the operations of the organisation and looking at the bigger picture, I don't mean going into the operations, but asking those strategic questions; what's happening here? And what path are we on?"
8IN,8IN_132,Q,"Rather than compliance, [unclear] 00:31:34 like legal -"
8IN,8IN_133,A,"Yeah, auditing -"
8IN,8IN_134,Q,-@ financial?
8IN,8IN_135,A,"- which should be an absolute given in terms that they're foundational, of course."
8IN,8IN_136,Q,"With diversity, do you think it can be seen to undermine that focus on risk or make it more complex?"
8IN,8IN_137,A,"No! You just have to make sure that - when you're looking at board composition you have to have those fundamentals covered, but it's - absolutely."
8IN,8IN_138,Q,"So, it has the capacity."
8IN,8IN_139,A,It has to have the capacity. You need a lawyer; you need an accountant.
8IN,8IN_14,Q,"Oh, of course. Oh, and you were the Chair of -"
8IN,8IN_140,Q,Do you think there's anything where diversity has little bearing on a particular board function? Is a board function that diversity has no bearing on it at all?
8IN,8IN_141,A,"No, I don't. Because when you think of risks and what blindsides boards or organisations is tunnel-vision, so you can be looking at the numbers but without someone asking a question from left field - that'll come from the edges rather than being right in the problem or the task. It's someone from over here that will say, ""Well, hang on, that doesn't quite sit comfortably with me because of my background that was in firefighting."""
8IN,8IN_142,Q,Exactly!
8IN,8IN_143,A,"No absolutely. If it's important enough and complex enough, I don't mean complicated but it's -"
8IN,8IN_144,Q,Socially and political.
8IN,8IN_145,A,"- yeah then diversity can only be an asset, not a distraction. But that's where it's not chaotic. Diversity is about how do we really access this rich resource in a way that's purposeful? It's not chaotic or we're not lurching all over the place because diversity is a resource."
8IN,8IN_146,Q,"Okay, beautiful. So, back to the flow. This is a bit like that - do you think there's any situational context that might cause you to change your importance rating? You've rated it at 10, for example; high uncertainty high risk, but you've just answered that. [overtalk] 00:34:13"
8IN,8IN_147,A,"No, I think it's exactly the opposite. When do we not need? When we're transacting, when something's really obvious but that's really why have a board."
8IN,8IN_148,Q,"Yeah exactly, do boards do that sort of thing?"
8IN,8IN_149,A,"No, that's the thing. That's the thing in that we're witnessing signatures, do we need 10 different types of writing styles? Probably not, but it's - I think the work of the board with risk management and the focus on the - it's not just governance, it's also strategy. So, I think it's really important. It can only add value."
8IN,8IN_15,A,"Senhoa, yes."
8IN,8IN_150,Q,"You've explained it beautifully, don't worry, that'll be fantastic. [Now, the] 00:35:00 thinking -"
8IN,8IN_151,A,I think that challenge that gets in the way is the prejudice too; alternatives or difference - 'you're not like me'.
8IN,8IN_152,Q,This is where your tolerance - the idea of acceptance and tolerance and the board culture.
8IN,8IN_153,A,"Acceptance is probably better than tolerance, isn't it?"
8IN,8IN_154,Q,"Yeah, possibly."
8IN,8IN_155,A,"So, inclusion! Everyone has to be equal. One of the other barriers too is status; hierarchy and clicks and power! Boards know all about power, of course. So, it's about how that is held by the chair and distributed in a healthy way, rather than grabbed and manipulated."
8IN,8IN_156,Q,"Nice. Okay, can you give me an example?"
8IN,8IN_157,A,Oh yes! Because I've got a -
8IN,8IN_158,Q,Because that's really good! You'd have heaps?
8IN,8IN_159,A,Well I do! I have one where I was on a board -
8IN,8IN_16,Q,It sounds such a beautiful goal to - this is the one about women in -
8IN,8IN_160,Q,"No, it's good. I think we've got time, haven't we? It's 35 minutes."
8IN,8IN_161,A,"Yeah, yep we're good, how much more time do we have?"
8IN,8IN_162,Q,Have we got 20 minutes?
8IN,8IN_163,A,"We've got 20 minutes and I'll run out of here, okay great. I was on a board where the CEO and it was a not-for-profit, it was the most ambitious individual, total narcissist and what he was doing was, he had built this team around him of 'yes' people, he was a very charismatic individual and he held all the power in his executive team and on the board. I won't go into the history, but he had what he considered - or who he considered to be quite a weak chair. He invited me to join the board for a particular reason and I was accepted on to the board, and I think he made the mistake that I was just going to be kind of his 'yes man'. Because that was the deal, right! That was the actual unconscious deal that he made with everyone that he surrounded himself with. What he did though, he was actually developing this IP - or someone in the business was - and he wanted to take that out to be a separate company."
8IN,8IN_164,Q,And IP is?
8IN,8IN_165,A,Intellectual Property.
8IN,8IN_166,Q,Oh! right.
8IN,8IN_167,A,"Yeah sorry! Software that could be used for their client base, but he wanted take it out to a separate company. Okay, that's interesting and he wanted to be CEO as well of that separate company and a shareholder because it was going to be a private company; and that he felt he was deserving of the shares because of what a wonderful job he'd done over here. So, myself and the chair and two other people on this board - there was about a dozen people on this board - had a different view! He went into a kind of narcissistic rage. We had a six hour board meeting which was terrible. It was just - and I have to say I think I participated as badly as everyone else! But the upshot of it all was that he actually found a way - a legal loophole - he'd found a lawyer that actually declared our board not legitimate because of some - and it was just - and he held all the money! This is a true story, it's phenomenal. I mean it's an extreme story, but when I was talking to the AICD and - the course, you'd be amazed at the stories that we hear, and it comes down to what lengths do you go to as a board member. Speaking up can obviously come at -"
8IN,8IN_168,Q,A great price.
8IN,8IN_169,A,"- and I know of many people who have been shunted off boards for speaking up. What was the question? Sorry, my fault!"
8IN,8IN_17,A,"Cambodia, that's right yes."
8IN,8IN_170,Q,A story of how the chair can facilitate these power games.
8IN,8IN_171,A,"Yes. Well that one was one where the chair clearly lost control and that was extremely toxic, but I think in that kind of situation, it's very, very difficult. That's an extreme -"
8IN,8IN_172,Q,Not a bad example.
8IN,8IN_173,A,"- but not as extreme. I think that it's a matter of trying to - well as I said before, ""Setting up. These are our rules of engagement."" Being very clear and consistent, it's like parenting! These are the boundaries and the consequences for everyone. We all sign up to them as adults. But I think it's about ensuring that you're fostering relationships with everyone. That's about inclusivity. What tends to happen naturally is that people can lean closer to other people, so then all the sibling rivalry starts to emerge. So, it's really making sure that - but also that people are accountable to contribute. That's the other thing, if you think about human history, the problem has always come up is when people feel that things are unequal. So, if I feel like you're king of being a passenger here and you're being paid or whatever and you're -"
8IN,8IN_174,Q,Freeloading.
8IN,8IN_175,A,"- just showing up, so I think it's about holding people to account. Having the rules of engagement, making them explicit, calling out the behaviour in that classic chair role, firmly and fairly. Having your conversations outside with your one-on-ones to try and like whisper the people -"
8IN,8IN_176,Q,Into the group.
8IN,8IN_177,A,"- yeah, into the group."
8IN,8IN_178,Q,"Good. That's a good example, it illustrated your point which was made earlier. There's a lot of talk about diversity of understanding, beliefs, problem solving; do you think that's really important?"
8IN,8IN_179,A,Diversity of?
8IN,8IN_18,Q,"- to prevent - well, hopefully limit their -"
8IN,8IN_180,Q,"Understandings, beliefs - it's called cognitive diversity."
8IN,8IN_181,A,"Yeah, absolutely! Because things like - whether it's our conscious vibes or cognitive vibes, there's about a hundred of them, I think - yeah, totally."
8IN,8IN_182,Q,Do you think everything reduces to that?
8IN,8IN_183,A,No.
8IN,8IN_184,Q,What doesn't and can you -
8IN,8IN_185,A,What doesn't reduce to cognitive diversity?
8IN,8IN_186,Q,"Yeah, because you talked a lot about the decision making and that which could come as cognitive diversity, it could be seen as cognitive diversity."
8IN,8IN_187,A,"Well, cognitive is only one element. And I think that's the problem, is when there's a bias just towards what seems - what can we make look like common-sense here? Or, a good business case for this? Human beings can rationalise anything. Particularly their own behaviour! That's why it's limiting. Things like integrity are incredibly important. Are we actually acting with integrity? The capacity to think systemically. Are we actually seeing the whole picture here? Can we refrain? Innovation plays a part, too. Can we think about this differently? Are we asking the right question? So that's another important thing. Are we all tapping into our own experience to bring to bear here? Or am I being unduly influenced by your story? Your experience bases? Are we really holding up the mirror here and seeing what our patterns are? Do we tend to just rubber-stamp, for example? There's a culture. What's the dance in the board? Is it just to kind of all agree or maybe we have someone who is a black-hat and we hound them down? What are the patterns? Do we actually hold the mirror up? Are we actually showing - tapping into our humanity?"
8IN,8IN_188,A,We are a group of human-beings and no matter what sector you're in or what board you're on; it involves people. It's going to impact on people so have we brought enough expertise into the room? Who do we need to collaborate and connect with? Are we positioned to make an important decision? I could go on and on!
8IN,8IN_189,Q,Perfect. That's excellent.
8IN,8IN_19,A,"That's yours, hope I've done that right. Have I signed it for you? Yeah, I have."
8IN,8IN_190,A,"And does it actually connect with what the organisations purpose is, as well? That's more the culture."
8IN,8IN_191,Q,"Okay, that's great. You've really situated it - shown the other things that matter."
8IN,8IN_192,A,Decision making is far more complex than -
8IN,8IN_193,Q,Cognitive.
8IN,8IN_194,A,- cognitive. That's the easy part.
8IN,8IN_195,Q,Then the challenge is when you're selecting new board members. How might you go about that if you're interested in building diversity?
8IN,8IN_196,A,"Well, I think you have that front and centre that we are building a diverse board and having quite a broad definition of diversity. Diversity is more than just gender and race, I think. It is about what is the range of experiences for example, that this person brings. The grittier someone's experience base is better, for example. I think setting that as front and centre and really looking hard to find people that - we're not cloning. We know what happens when we clone, yeah?"
8IN,8IN_197,Q,"Yeah. Have you seen this work well through - are there particular strategies that really help to select a board that is diverse like that? Because it's hard to measure some of these things, I mean, backgrounds you can."
8IN,8IN_198,A,"I think in practice and there'd be other people better qualified - I imagine - the technical capacities to do this exist, you get the experts in; recruitment et cetera. But I think that generally speaking, it is about who knows who, who's turn it is, who's in the right place at the right time, quite often, do we need a female? All these other drivers that also can come into place. It is hard - very rarely do you start with a blank slate anyway. No, I can't think of examples where it's happened beautifully!"
8IN,8IN_199,Q,"I see your organisation as doing - really being about cultivating board candidates - leadership ultimately, if you want to have impact not just senior management and executive management but being on a board. That's really your -"
8IN,8IN_2,Q,"Well thank you, Participant, for agreeing to participate, that's wonderful."
8IN,8IN_20,Q,It's good.
8IN,8IN_200,A,Being a worth board member.
8IN,8IN_201,Q,"Yeah, exactly."
8IN,8IN_202,A,That's definitely what my - my core business and focus and passion.
8IN,8IN_203,Q,"Given that, do you do anything to help people from minority groups, they might be financially - you would charge, so there could be financial barriers for some people? So, do you have any strategies to cultivate people perhaps from a lower socio-economic group?"
8IN,8IN_204,A,"I do, yes. I just don't charge them corporate rates. It's often less than half of what my normal would be. Years ago, I use to charge - and sometimes I charge nothing - if I mentoring and I actually call it mentoring, so I'm seeing a young person and she's on the board of her own not-for-profit. It's extraordinary, I find them so inspiring but for people whose organisation's not funding them, yeah, I do. I always have."
8IN,8IN_205,Q,"Okay, oh good. That's [unclear] 00:47:49"
8IN,8IN_206,A,I want to do more in that - and I don't quite know what it is - in that I feel like there's something in me still that - I am very passionate about the world actually needs worthy leaders. I don't quite know what that looks like yet and I'm not overstating my own - I'm not being grandiose here but I feel like I would like to contribute. I'm not quite sure what that platform looks like at this point - sort of a niggle!
8IN,8IN_207,Q,"Yeah, okay. I will ask of other people; I'm intrigued how it might be solved. From a regulatory perspective, how do you feel about the way diversity of boards is currently being promoted in Australia? For example, through gender targets and quotas?"
8IN,8IN_208,A,"I wonder whether - I think targets are great. In a way in terms of it's a bit like the TAC saying, ""Let's go towards zero."" I think it's an aspiration. I think an aspiration is important, that we're 50% of the population that boards need to reflect that. I do worry about the compliance part of it; it's like force feeding."
8IN,8IN_209,Q,"How do you think it effects - because you're very much into the confidence, the self-perception of the leader - do you think it might affect the self-perception?"
8IN,8IN_21,A,"Excellent, yeah so that's good and I've been on other boards and things as well. So, hopefully I can be of some assistance."
8IN,8IN_210,A,"Absolutely! I always say to people, ""Even if you're being offered a job, let alone the top job, it's far better if you go through a merit selection; you'll own it, rather than, “I got parachuted in."" It's the worst feeling for people in terms of sense of worthiness. That's what I mean, I have mixed feelings around that - and there are great women!"
8IN,8IN_211,Q,Of course!
8IN,8IN_212,A,"That's the thing, look a bit harder!"
8IN,8IN_213,Q,"Exactly, you haven't even looked!"
8IN,8IN_214,A,"Encourage, foster."
8IN,8IN_215,Q,"We have women on boards here that are focussed on that strategy. Another kind of diversity that you feel cannot be reliably measured and reported on, were you - like targets you think, can be useful -"
8IN,8IN_216,A,"Aspirations, yeah. Targets, yeah."
8IN,8IN_217,Q,"So, there are somethings that can't be measured and put up there as a graph -"
8IN,8IN_218,A,"Well, I think -"
8IN,8IN_219,Q,How might?
8IN,8IN_22,Q,"Yes, I am sure you will. So, let's get going, okay. There's a lot of talk about board diversity, but we're interested to hear from people on the ground and particularly from the Australian point of view, because there's not much research from the Australian point of view. So, there's a lot of theory from other countries, but we're looking to develop a model that is informed by people - and I know you work in the US, you're quite a global citizen - but I also notice that you do work here in Australia."
8IN,8IN_220,A,"Oh, sorry, I've interrupted."
8IN,8IN_221,Q,"No, no go for it, please."
8IN,8IN_222,A,"One of the things that strikes me - and I've enjoyed the AICD course - but I think that not enough - or I might be wrong, but I think in my experience and just looking at the end result - is done to really educate, to train boards in Vivo almost - how can we be effective? In the same way that you might do for an executive team. But I think that it's too much experience and seen as the transacting, the getting through the board papers. I find board roles actually really quite unappealing and uninteresting."
8IN,8IN_223,Q,Yeah?
8IN,8IN_224,A,I do!
8IN,8IN_225,Q,"Defined roles, it goes with it! Anyway, the final question because I'm aware of the time."
8IN,8IN_226,A,"Yes, that's fine."
8IN,8IN_227,Q,"Finally, looking 10 years into the future, Participant, how would you like to see the diversity of the Australian boards?"
8IN,8IN_228,A,"Oh I would - look, walk around Melbourne, we are a multi-cultural society and so I would love to see us - it's a bit like that picture behind you, it's just reflecting the colours and the vibrancy - look at that! the dynamism that comes from race, cultures, gender, age variation. Have the warrior youth and the elders of the tribe all on the board! In terms of contributing in their own ways and learning from each other."
8IN,8IN_229,Q,"Oh, that's fantastic. You've been a consistent focus on this process which is so key to the board's functioning."
8IN,8IN_23,A,"Yeah, in the main."
8IN,8IN_230,A,Yeah.
8IN,8IN_231,Q,I think it comes through in how you define diversity and I love the way you finish with it! It's beautiful.
8IN,8IN_232,A,"Well, I'm hope I've been able to give you something!"
8IN,8IN_233,Q,"Oh, absolutely. Really good, seriously. Any final comments?"
8IN,8IN_234,A,"Well, no it's interesting. No, not on - but it's actually interesting -"
8IN,8IN_235,Q,Do I take this off?
8IN,8IN_236,A,"Yes, sure."
8IN,8IN_24,Q,"Exactly, so you're familiar with our corporate landscape -"
8IN,8IN_25,A,Yes.
8IN,8IN_26,Q,"- and how that feeds into boards. So, I chose to use the questions from institutions. They're institutions and people that influence Australian boards, rather than the questions directed at a director to talk about their particular board experience."
8IN,8IN_27,A,Okay!
8IN,8IN_28,Q,"Because that's what I really want, I thought you'd be able to bring."
8IN,8IN_29,A,Sure.
8IN,8IN_3,A,Are we being taped?
8IN,8IN_30,Q,"So first, how have the composition of boards, that you're familiar with, changed over time in terms of diversity? Has it increased? Decreased?"
8IN,8IN_31,A,"Well if I think about over time and reporting into a board at quite a young age, in my late 20s in my first leadership role, and we do have females on boards and obviously not enough! But that's been one change."
8IN,8IN_32,Q,"We're getting more, you mean?"
8IN,8IN_33,A,Yeah.
8IN,8IN_34,Q,Was that a for-profit or a not-for-profit?
8IN,8IN_35,A,"It was in the higher-ed sector, so yeah, not-for-profit, I guess. And actually, being on a board also in my 30s myself for-profit and I was the only female. Look, I don’t think that's changed a lot to be honest, in terms of diversity."
8IN,8IN_36,Q,You're thinking specifically gender diversity?
8IN,8IN_37,A,"Well that's the obvious one. But I think probably the less visible and more impactful element is personalities. For example, if you think about who actually ends up on boards, it's people who are achievement oriented which is good, and outcomes oriented which is also good, but that kind of classic split between the focus on task and people that - so that's one thing that you get a lot more people with more of an engineer type brain, rather than an innovative artist type personality; that would be one thing. So, logic over possibilities, sometimes. Brain over heart. I think also, the other obvious - which is more obvious too - is just social stratum. I think it's just the kind of middle class; educated of course, I've got my MBA in my briefcase!"
8IN,8IN_38,Q,How does your organisation - I'll call you an organisation - how does your organisation influence that kind of diversity? Or seek to influence that kind of diversity of boards?
8IN,8IN_39,A,"Well, that's why I wrote my book! In that for me, it's all about helping people, good people and what I mean by good people; people who are motivated to make a contribution, whatever sector they're in, a positive contribution to ask the question of, ‘Well why not me?’ The reason I called my book 'The Worthy Leader' is that so many people can - it's quite extraordinary how many people - even when they are at the table, are still asking 'am I doing a good enough job? could someone else do a better job?'"
8IN,8IN_4,Q,And I'll just turn this on -
8IN,8IN_40,A,"So, addressing that particular question, but also helping people really focus on that question of, how can I expand my worth and impact? And the way that most organisations are structured now, whether it's at the executive general board level, it's about being at the table. It's about participating. So, if I'm at the table, I have a voice and I can influence, which is really everything that speaks to leadership."
8IN,8IN_41,Q,This is what you - for the sake of the context - how do you influence? How does your organisation seek to influence? You've got a book -
8IN,8IN_42,A,"Via coaching and facilitation and it's really helping people to see - through those processes they're the two key processes - helping people to see themselves more accurately, clearly and their context. And to ask those questions; well, why not me? How do I get a seat at that table? Then if I'm there, what kind of impact can I make?"
8IN,8IN_43,Q,"Do you work around people's networks? Do you use your own networks to help people that you're coaching or whatever? Or, do you work through the individual that you're working with only?"
8IN,8IN_44,A,"In the main, it's working with the individual; however, when I'm working in a mentoring role, I also meld - work as a mentor which is usually pro bono, it pretty well is - and so then I will tap into my own networks, bringing people together. In fact, I've got a meeting with a mentee this afternoon and in a form of when I'm in a coaching environment, occasionally I do. But it's more about helping people access their own wisdom, for want of a better word, in terms of their self-belief and to look at what they need to optimise within themselves, and also to activate their own networks."
8IN,8IN_45,Q,Part of the empowerment?
8IN,8IN_46,A,Exactly.
8IN,8IN_47,Q,"Okay, great thanks. Do you see this influence works across all industry sectors or do you think it works - your approach, your organisation - is it really specific industries?"
8IN,8IN_48,A,"Without question, across all sectors for every leader. Whether they're an aspirant leader, whether they're already at the table. I do a lot of work with CEOs for example through YPO which is the world's largest CEO network. What I do with them is group coaching, where they're from different organisations and they come together. Of course, many of them are chairs of their own boards as well. Without question, helping busy people stop and reflect and ask strategic questions about their leadership impact. It's important for everyone. I wish I'd had it!"
8IN,8IN_49,Q,"Yeah exactly. So, how important do you think it is to have a diverse board? If I gave you a scale of one to 10; one not at all, 10 extremely?"
8IN,8IN_5,A,Yeah great.
8IN,8IN_50,A,"Extremely. I mean for me, diversity is about inclusion, it's about tolerance and acceptance and that of course is about openness to learning. Which of course allows us to tap into the richness of other people's stories, whether their life experience or their practical technical experience; and I see this happen all the time in the groups of CEOs that I'm working with. Someone will come from the construction industry and then you'll have someone from retail or you'll have someone come from a very affluent background, you'll have someone who's come from struggle street as part of their story. Well, I'd never thought of it like that. You see people literally expand their perspective and so if you think about all that feeding into the decision making, the discerning process which leaders have to make which is how do we make the right decision here in these complex circumstances? It's so helpful, it's absolutely imperative and it's the survival of the species, right? Diversity!"
8IN,8IN_51,Q,You're the first person to describe it that way. It's wonderful! You're number 12.
8IN,8IN_52,A,Oh!
8IN,8IN_53,Q,"Yes, this is great."
8IN,8IN_54,A,It's what I see.
8IN,8IN_55,Q,It's beautiful.
8IN,8IN_56,A,"It actually works. It's about how we do activate and tap into - whether it's your story or expertise, it's phenomenal the stories and backgrounds that people have. It's about unlocking and allowing -"
8IN,8IN_57,Q,Unlocking?
8IN,8IN_58,A,"Yeah, unlocking that diversity and allowing - appropriately, of course - be accessible to others."
8IN,8IN_59,Q,"So, this group, where you have the CEs from different places, do you select it to be a diverse group?"
8IN,8IN_6,Q,- and here's a consent form for it.
8IN,8IN_60,A,"No, the organisation - it's one of their values, diversity, the reality - and there's something like 27,000 members from across the world, so it's massive; quite USA eccentric. But the reality is we get these little groups together, they're called forums, eight to 10 people. Except for countries like Indonesia where - in the main, they're quite male dominant, of course. They're not diverse in that they've ended up - they may not have started - but they've ended up being the wealthy people. Because the selection criteria to belong to the organisation is pretty high, very high. So, there's that, but we certainly have diversity of race - it's a global organisation - definitely; religions, personalities and they're actively trying to get more females. The other thing we do is we have younger - the CEOs kids are active in the organisation as are their partners. But they're not in the actual particular little groups, but they have their own separate - so that's inclusive."
8IN,8IN_61,Q,It spreads out the network through the family.
8IN,8IN_62,A,"Mm-hm, it's family friendly."
8IN,8IN_63,Q,"So, in Australia, what's the story here with that organisation? I know that isn't easy."
8IN,8IN_64,A,"Well the story here in Australia is - oh and the other diverse element that they have is, totally diverse sectors people come from. It could be engineering or it could be advertising agencies whatever, so there's definitely the different sectors. There's also the difference between corporate and entrepreneurs so that provides diversity. And there's also what I call MFBs, my father's business! Then the ones that have been the founders of their own business. So, there is that, yeah."
8IN,8IN_65,Q,"How it came to be. So, in Australia, the situation?"
8IN,8IN_66,A,That's the situation.
8IN,8IN_67,Q,That's the situation here?
8IN,8IN_68,A,Yeah!
8IN,8IN_69,Q,That's out here too?  Because I notice you're a facilitator with these organisations -
8IN,8IN_7,A,"Great, okay."
8IN,8IN_70,A,"Yes, that's right."
8IN,8IN_71,Q,-@ So you do that out here in Australia.
8IN,8IN_72,A,Yes.
8IN,8IN_73,Q,"Okay, perfect that's good. You think it's really important - diversity here in Australia, has it always been important, do you think?"
8IN,8IN_74,A,"Oh, as I said, ""It's the survival of the species."" In that if I'm not able to access a range of possibilities from within a board or from within an executive team, then the chances of us being vibrant and flourishing - that's why organisations get blindsided, because we think of all the cognitive biases and decision making, for example - in that we need someone, not just through a skill base but because they're coming from a diverse background."
8IN,8IN_75,Q,It's raw.
8IN,8IN_76,A,How about this? Or what I know is something different?
8IN,8IN_77,Q,Do you think such diversity has always been valued by others? By other boards? Seen as a good thing to have?
8IN,8IN_78,A,"No! [unclear] 00:18:49 no, not at all, look at the history of the human race!"
8IN,8IN_79,Q,"Do you think it's become more important, recently?"
8IN,8IN_8,Q,"You've probably read it. I'm very keen to hear your views, as I mentioned in the lift, of how you can influence Australian boards and in particular looking up-stream, because of your work in leadership and coaching."
8IN,8IN_80,A,"I think we are in transition and it seems like the transition has been taking a long time and I think that's totally understandable, particularly when you think about gender, which I think has been the biggest shift. What we've got at the moment is probably compliance around that and it's what people say when they're not in their formal roles, which I think is most telling."
8IN,8IN_81,A,"Still the boy’s club, for example; yesterday I was invited to a meeting of the boys and they forgot that I was on the invitation and it was about confirming, and one of them says, ""Yeah, I'll be there you c-u-n-t!"" and I've heard it before, nothing will shock me but I'm thinking - so it's that kind - because they were thinking they were just in their club and that's fine. I guess what that speaks to is that there's a lot being suppressed I think, and they thought that was private, that discussion. Rather than - generalisations are so - the trend is; we're not there."
8IN,8IN_82,Q,Because there's still that language.
8IN,8IN_83,A,"Yeah and there's still, I think, resentment which is very politically incorrect to express on behalf of males; for them to be able to say, ""We're forced to have females, there's pressure on us and we have to be seen to be doing the right thing."" Look at what happened with the board directors of that bank, I think that's a classic example where with the Royal Commission. They were the ones - the two - I can't remember who they were with, was it - look I'm just saying, I think it's still - women are judged more harshly and there is a sense of - I think the whole merit versus quota thing is still very muddy. We're not there yet."
8IN,8IN_84,Q,"Good, because they're these questions. I might switch to that and make sure that we don't miss a point. We're talking now about barriers. Five years ago, the situation was very clubby and now you don't see any difference?"
8IN,8IN_85,A,"At the deepest level, not. It's what's running under the surface. At the surface, absolutely. People are forced to resign if they say something inappropriate or we have to have the quotas at the table and I am generalising. Of course, some organisations have made that shift -"
8IN,8IN_86,Q,"At the deepest level, we're talking?"
8IN,8IN_87,A,"It's cultural I think, both at a broader level and at an organisational level in that - and it's a real transition, almost like a changing-of-the-guard in that - and there's also another force that's rising, which is through the younger people too, which is the next generation coming up, which is the - what's the word? Which is the - they're not conditioned like I was for example and you might have been too, that it was normal to have just white middle-aged men around the table in this country and that you didn't give it a second thought. Whereas now, I think we're all noticing and thinking, hang on a second, that picture doesn't look quite right. So, I think things are shifting but not in reality at the table, if that makes sense. Yes, social mores and - definitely I think there's a shift but it's still - we're not there."
8IN,8IN_88,Q,"Okay, so the social mores that can help to drive organisational or cultural change?"
8IN,8IN_89,A,Absolutely.
8IN,8IN_9,A,"I'm all about - it's the journey to leadership wisdom. My focus is on leadership maturity. I've had a lot of years and I had businesses in leadership competence, 360-Degree Feedback et cetera and I just became increasingly interested in leadership maturity."
8IN,8IN_90,Q,And then that in turn can help to reshape the table or board -
8IN,8IN_91,A,Absolutely.
8IN,8IN_92,Q,- and the decision makers -
8IN,8IN_93,A,Yes.
8IN,8IN_94,Q,- but it's slow.
8IN,8IN_95,A,"It's slow and it's generational. If you look at, for example, the role of the male parent - think back to my father for example - so of course, but it's a transition and it's painful for some people."
8IN,8IN_96,Q,This is now the making sense of why age diversity might be important because it will help to bring in the newer social mores -
8IN,8IN_97,A,Absolutely.
8IN,8IN_98,Q,"- in selection, for selection. So, your role then in mentoring and facilitation, do you work with the social mores to try and influence organisational culture?"
8IN,8IN_99,A,"Yes, I've done a lot of that but I think at the moment as well probably more frequently, it's working with the individual and their own self-limiting beliefs; which begs that question of before -"
9Db,9Db_1,A,"No, it’s actually two months short of 22 years, but as I pointed out to you it’s only been one board so I haven't had a cross section experience of other boards."
9Db,9Db_10,Q,And it was 22 years?
9Db,9Db_100,A,"Yes, it’s market evidence."
9Db,9Db_101,Q,"- for resolving it, yeah.  the conflict that arose around this, did it divide the board?"
9Db,9Db_102,A,"No because if a board was tending to divide on something then we got an independent evaluation of the circumstance, of the issue and we’d generally then settle for whatever they came up with, albeit it might’ve been tweaked a bit or something like that.  But I can recall that the Fund Manager Entity did take a bigger chunk of equity in the fund eventually, and so the fact that you’ve got skin in the game meant that they had to look after both their longer term interests the same as they had investors. So they were on board in that way, but day to day fee structures, well yeah you’ll pinch a bit of money here and there."
9Db,9Db_103,Q,"So there’s another thing now, there’s the long term interest and the independent advice helping to alleviate the conflict?"
9Db,9Db_104,A,Mm hm.
9Db,9Db_105,Q,"Beautiful, okay.  And yes, the conflict or diversity, was it influenced by institutions such as your big investors, super investors and stuff like that?"
9Db,9Db_106,A,"Yes. We used to meet at least once a year with investors, and sometimes depending on the circumstances if there was a big buyout of another company or something like that sometimes the investors wanted to meet to talk about that because it was quite a big chunk of money or something like that. But we met with investors on an investor tour once a year.  That’s the chairman and myself, I did that with the Victorian and another director did New South Wales.  It was just depending on the circumstances. The GFC obviously raised a lot of issues there, and the investors were calling for more feedback on issues that were going on overseas and things like that."
9Db,9Db_107,A,"So in those circumstances yeah investors heightened their feedback, but in good times, well in the last few years I recall at annual board meetings where the investors turned up we would be lucky to have 10 people, whereas after the GFC we would’ve had 200."
9Db,9Db_108,Q,Wow.
9Db,9Db_109,A,So you can see how it reflects on the day to day and how it’s all travelling.  If it’s smooth going you never hear from them.
9Db,9Db_11,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_110,Q,So the GFC was a major marker in board -
9Db,9Db_111,A,"Yes because of the losses that were there, the share prices dropped dramatically and we had a lot of overseas investment in America and that sort of thing too so -"
9Db,9Db_112,Q,"Yeah, so you were exposed."
9Db,9Db_113,A,"Yeah, currency fluctuations really exposes you all from GFC.  So yes, in times of trouble you really get the feedback."
9Db,9Db_114,Q,"And going back to diversity, diversity helps there?"
9Db,9Db_115,A,"Most definitely. In handling those issues, yeah absolutely because you only have one of those GFCs once in your business lifetime -"
9Db,9Db_116,Q,Hopefully.
9Db,9Db_117,A,"Generally, yeah, and coping with that takes a lot more time and involvement in what you’re doing."
9Db,9Db_118,Q,"So how did diversity of the board help with that situation, that adjustment?"
9Db,9Db_119,A,"I think someone who’s had experience in overseas investments, with the financial transactions between two countries, having a knowledge of that.  Having a knowledge of the respective governances in another country as well as our country.  They differ in some aspects and you have to compromise through a point on some of those or at least have to be aware of them.  The reporting systems are different and all that.  So in terms of diversity someone who’s had experience in overseas investments is important."
9Db,9Db_12,Q,"Okay, so first how has the composition of the board that you’re familiar with changed over those 22 years?  How has it changed?"
9Db,9Db_120,Q,Before the global financial crisis that really wasn’t considered?
9Db,9Db_121,A,"It probably was yeah, but then again that’s my only experience in overseas investments and it really hit home then.  On other boards, well there’s a lot of Australian companies that invest overseas, huge some companies, so they would require that sort of experience from that board diversity in terms of that sort of thing."
9Db,9Db_122,Q,"So that’s not just skills now, that’s experience background.  Like someone who’s been to the States and worked in that industry over there is valuable on the board here?"
9Db,9Db_123,A,"Yeah, and all the governance would surround businesses over there as well. So that’s probably key for that rather than just a designated Australian company, specifically Australian investment."
9Db,9Db_124,Q,With your board it was really the global financial crisis that brought that need to the surface.
9Db,9Db_125,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_126,Q,Probably for a number of other Australian boards that was a real wakeup call to this is a global community and diversity will help us.
9Db,9Db_127,A,"Yeah.  At all times you can go and outsource it with the Australian legal system who are fairly up with all those latest things, and you can always get their opinions, which we did in a lot of cases.  But even again the final decisions, and if you have a diverse board and they’re on top of that and are familiar with it, then it’s easier to make a decision."
9Db,9Db_128,Q,You can anticipate.
9Db,9Db_129,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_13,A,Well originally when I was asked to go on this board it was a newly formed trust back in ’95.  My understanding in those days having not been on a board before was that I was interviewed by the directors of a major Bank and they wanted to have someone of experience because they were putting together a shopping centre retail trust.  So with my background and -
9Db,9Db_130,Q,"Good, okay.  This is a question about the role of the chair. We’ve talked about outsourcing the decision to an independent about finances, about fees, was there anything else that the chair did perhaps in the situation where the global financial crisis happened and the impacts were being felt, and your board was let’s say struggling to respond to this incredible overnight almost uncertainty and risk exposure and loss, so how did the board respond, did it create conflict and if so what role did the chair play?"
9Db,9Db_131,A,We certainly visited America a few more times to meet – we had joint venture partners over there.  So we met with them face to face rather than accepting what management tell us.  So we had a firsthand view of who we’re dealing with.  Now I’ve forgotten the question.
9Db,9Db_132,Q,In this crisis situation what did the chair and the board do to manage that conflict?
9Db,9Db_133,A,"There’s probably a lot more outsourcing required into how we managed these circumstances.  Market trending on where the market was going and making decisions at the right time and for the right reason.  Our chair, he was very experienced. He came from an accounting background and a number of boards.  What else?"
9Db,9Db_134,Q,"So it sounds as though it was a reliance on outsourcing to get independent expert advice, and trending and analysis did management do that or was that once again outsourced?"
9Db,9Db_135,A,"Management instructed them on the feedback we needed, then of course they run with it, and then they come and present it back to the board after that.  So you just rely on the management and how they present it to them.  But it’s normally documented stuff in any case so it’s nothing they can invent if you like.  So they prepared all that and it came back in a final draft and then we went through that."
9Db,9Db_136,Q,"So I would call this like a rational decision making process, was there anything around the social soft stuff?  So were people anxious and did the chair do anything, did the board do anything to manage anxieties within the board?  Was insurance around -"
9Db,9Db_137,A,"Yeah, things like insurances and things like that were checked.  The grievances were expressed at annual general meetings when the shareholders came along, and you got the drift of what they were looking at and what they wanted you to achieve or avoid or whatever. As is aid the difference between when there’s an urgent situation on and things are going smoothly, in terms of people harassing you or investors harassing you, it’s just one extreme to another, and as long as they’re getting their return, reasonable and that, everybody goes quiet.  With the bigger investors you go and talk it through with them, and generally they’re aware of what’s going on in the market in any case and they might just have some questions on, “Is so and so doing his job properly?”, the CEO or something like that."
9Db,9Db_138,A,"Because the investors also meet with CEOs and that sort of thing, and if they had any grievances with the key executive staff they would air those at our meetings.  If it was something extremely crucial they’d just pick up the phone and ring the chair. So from that point of view you’ve got an open door to all investors at any time, and as long as you maintain that then there’s no need for panic."
9Db,9Db_139,Q,"So really the chair had to work with, it’s not just the board, it’s about the relations between management and investors and the board."
9Db,9Db_14,Q,Your background’s in?
9Db,9Db_140,A,"That’s right, yeah."
9Db,9Db_141,Q,"So that really became the focus then, not just are we being nice and open to each and respectful."
9Db,9Db_142,A,"No, and you’ve got to be completely honest in what you portray to the investors as well.  Everybody gets found out eventually if you twist something which isn't quite true.  There’s always stuff on the table that someone can find and research it and say, “Hey, that wasn’t said on this date, it was said on another date and this is what you said and no you didn’t do it.”"
9Db,9Db_143,Q,Yeah because they’re big stakes aren't they?
9Db,9Db_144,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_145,Q,"I talked about cognitive diversity, you’ve already answered that question, so now it’s the last few questions, managing diversity.  This is about board selection, did the board consider ways to increase diversity as you understood it the skills I think it’s your background skills when they were selecting?"
9Db,9Db_146,A,"Yes, and again today as distinct from years gone by around the mid 90’s, back in the Macquarie days when the fund was managed by Macquarie in those early days from what as far as I was aware, a lot of new directors were just recommendations from inside directors, whereas now the directors use companies to outsource and present people who match what your criteria is.  So you’re relying on them because again there’s platforms for that, for people who put their names on these sort of things as experience and that, so should it come up you can pick them off and say well these are the groups that do the initial investigation, do the basic research of what you’re trying to achieve in terms of the board, and then they might put up half a dozen people for the board to review them face to face independently."
9Db,9Db_147,A,"So that was probably one of the biggest transitions I saw over the time is that became more professional and selective about who they chose rather than maybe than just, “I’ve got a friend that wants to go on the board.”  I suspect a lot of that used to happen."
9Db,9Db_148,Q,So when did this change happen?
9Db,9Db_149,A,It’s hard to pick of the time.
9Db,9Db_15,A,"In shopping centre management, development, leasing and all that sort of thing, I attained that background working with Westfield combined with a retail background with Woolworths supermarkets.  So I was doing some consulting work for a major bank and they asked me, “Would you mind having a position on this new Retail REIT board we are creating?  I knew nothing about board positions back then and it would appear you didn’t have to have any sort of set criteria for it, but obviously my retail and associated property background suited their requirements.  But as time went on and you’ll appreciate that governments became more involved with the regulatory process and the deeper responsibilities representing investor’s interests. So it was the responsibility of the company forming these Trusts etc., to drill down a bit more to ensure appropriate business backgrounds of Board members which adequately represented the investor and regulatory requirements."
9Db,9Db_150,Q,"Five, 10 years ago?"
9Db,9Db_151,A,"I’d say probably more so after the GFC I think, yeah you were expected to get out there.  With the gender diversity too, that has brought that in as well because there’s been a push for that in the last 10 years as well.  So in that last five years or even the last three to five years we had the first woman ever introduced to our board who came on, and then one of the other directors who represented the Property Trust for the management, she was a director too.  So that was changing as my term was coming to an end.  Again it’s very unusual I think to have a board with the amount of men that we had on it to go for such a long term each one."
9Db,9Db_152,A,"But again I think that just shows that the board work well together so they kept it, and the investors saw that the board was working well together and the results were there so there was no need to change it.  So again it’s only something disruptive in the market sometimes that it gets ripples back up and they want to have a look at change."
9Db,9Db_153,Q,The tenure was quite long -
9Db,9Db_154,A,"Well mine was and the chairman when I was there, he was there for at least 18 years and he’s just retired last year and there was another chap there who was there  for about 12 to 14 years as well."
9Db,9Db_155,Q,So now is it a limited period you’re on the board for?
9Db,9Db_156,A,"I think it always had a limitation, but in the transition from when the original management platform was sold from one banking entity to the new specialist Property Trust REIT, we existing Independent Directors had a further “grandfathering” extension period of two three year terms by default, when it transitioned over to the new entity. The new entity wanted to retain the Trusts historic knowledge through the sitting Independent Directors, as it was important to show their investors that Board stability prevailed at least into the near future. If the success of the group was there since the REIT’s inception, why would you push them out?"
9Db,9Db_157,Q,"So this could be a barrier to diversity, if the current board was not diverse but it was performing well then -"
9Db,9Db_158,A,"Yes, there’s no need to change it."
9Db,9Db_159,Q,"Exactly, if it ain’t broke don’t change it."
9Db,9Db_16,A,"Being there for so long and over all those years I’ve learnt a lot, but much of the actual Board member roll process I learnt as I was going.  What’s transpired over that time is the market has become more regulated and more specific on what they expect board members experience to cover.  Anyway, I remained on the board as I said 22 years, but it’s a continual ongoing process to stay abreast of all the new evolving regulatory requirements and investor expectations."
9Db,9Db_160,A,Yeah. There’s a lot to be said for that.
9Db,9Db_161,Q,"Exactly, and from an investor point of view and they’re so influential, there’s uncertainty that we can’t manage but we can manage the certainty, the stability of the board."
9Db,9Db_162,A,"Yeah.  So long as, and I’ve said this before, you have to be – the appointment of what’s her name from the TV personality who’s gone on the ABC?"
9Db,9Db_163,Q,Ita Buttrose
9Db,9Db_164,A,"Ita Buttrose.  I mean she looks good and everything like that, but at 75 I would be very sceptical of putting someone at 75 years of age.  Someone could be bright and smart but - just to give you an example one of our board members who was getting up to 72, he was a very knowledgeable man and a very nice gentleman, but he got to the point where he forgot the AGM or he missed it somehow and there was another occasion when he missed meetings.  You start to wonder when the drop off point is at an age, and I think you’ve got to be very conscience of age and related ongoing cognitive skills."
9Db,9Db_165,Q,"Do you recognise that through skills, like forgetting meetings and things like that, or do you make an age where we can cut off?  What do you feel?"
9Db,9Db_166,A,"Well generally the term’s three years and you can change in that period I think when you get to that age point.  The older you become you realise, that for some, yeah you lose the plot –"
9Db,9Db_167,Q,More vulnerable.
9Db,9Db_168,A,"Yeah, you’re more vulnerable to things.  I think you’ve got to be very careful, and not only that, with the way things are now with – sorry."
9Db,9Db_169,A,[Phone call interruption]
9Db,9Db_17,Q,"So you said it became more regulated, was there an event like the HIH crash or something that triggered it?"
9Db,9Db_170,A,[End part one] [Start part two]
9Db,9Db_171,A,What was I saying? I’ve lost my track now.
9Db,9Db_172,Q,"Oh age.  Forgetting where we are, you know."
9Db,9Db_173,A,"Yeah.  I just think boards have got to be very careful about that, and whilst someone may have had a lot of experience in that field you’ve got to be very conscious of yeah, you can lose it a bit.  And not only that, with cyber activity, with all the technical data stuff that comes on, it just changes so quickly.  We know from our phones and all that sort of thing, and you don’t necessarily as you get older keep up with that sort of stuff.  I think if you’re acting on behalf of younger investors you’ve got to have someone in there who’s fairly astute or up with it or be able to absorb that sort of stuff.  The dynamics of business is just changing so quickly that you can’t afford to have someone who’s just on the fringe."
9Db,9Db_174,Q,A balance perhaps.  It’s a mix.
9Db,9Db_175,A,"Oh yes, I’m not saying you wipe them off.  You have to assess them.  And how young do you go on a board?  What was I, 48 or something?  Generally I think independent directors are at least are over 50 any rate I think most.  I don’t know, you’d know more than me."
9Db,9Db_176,Q,"I’ve been interviewing people in their early 40s, and someone said she was on a board, her first board when in her 30s, she’s 32. So it depends doesn’t it?"
9Db,9Db_177,A,Well yeah it depends on how big your company is and all that sort of thing –
9Db,9Db_178,Q,"Of course, yeah.  A lot of these young people are getting on boards, they’re not paid positions and it’s to get board experience so they can get on the sort of board you’re talking about."
9Db,9Db_179,A,"Yes I know, a friend of mine is doing that too."
9Db,9Db_18,A,"Look I can’t remember specifically back then whether there was or there wasn’t, I just think there’s more expectations by investors, I think there was a lot more super funds coming out of the woodwork that wanted investment on behalf of clients and things like that.  So potentially the backwash from some of those investors, they asked more questions and their expectations were a bit higher on regulation and all that sort of thing.  So maybe that was relevant.  Certainly after the GFC things tightened up a bit more as well."
9Db,9Db_180,Q,"Do you feel that tensions can arise in board selection between on the one hand trying to obtain a collegiate fit, so to manage the culture of your board, and on the other hand trying to avoid groupthink or everyone thinking the same way?  Do you think that tension can arise in who you select between those two?  “This one will get on really well with our culture, respect, openness, whatever else, but there’s a risk of groupthink.”"
9Db,9Db_181,A,And you’re saying should you –
9Db,9Db_182,Q,"Would you feel that there can be tension?  When you’re instructing the head hunters, “This is the sort of person we want” how do you manage that tension?"
9Db,9Db_183,A,"Well I think first off the head hunters have got to have a good round conference with the directors or the people who are wanting to form the group of people, the chairman, to ensure that they have on board exactly what you’re looking for.  Then after that really if they’re bringing say half a dozen people to you, it’s up to the board to say, “Well really there’s no one there that really fits” or, “Yeah that one fits perfectly.”  I don’t see how you can do it any other way really."
9Db,9Db_184,Q,"Yeah, but the fit in terms of culture and the fit in terms of having different ways of looking at things, different backgrounds, different understandings, different skill mix, so getting on, fitting in and bringing all those different understandings including the digital, global, all these different things that come up.  So getting that – because you’ve got one person, so you might have someone who’s really good on digital but they are so disrespectful, they don’t listen, and you might find gee, that seems to be what this group are like."
9Db,9Db_185,A,"Well I think I would prioritise someone who’s open and listens to everybody, takes on board and has a firm opinion on what they think, I think I’d prioritise them over someone who had the specific detailed knowledge of the criteria you’re looking for in the business you’re looking for.  I think discussion opens up everything in any case, it opens it up more, and the more abilities you have within your board to ensure that happens then I think you get more from it, a better result from it rather than someone that might be absolutely a genius in their field but not be able to converse and interact with people and get the right combined result around it.  Yeah, I think I’d tend towards that one."
9Db,9Db_186,Q,"That sounds really sensible.  And then with outsource, get your independent expert opinion from that?"
9Db,9Db_187,A,"Yeah, because you always have that as an option outside to go externally and investigate there. They’re a little bit more costly and all that sort of thing, but if you get the result that doesn’t matter."
9Db,9Db_188,Q,"Yeah, and if it’s important.  Okay, that’s good.  The board that you’re on, do you feel there are any barriers to managing or building diversity?  Let’s say pre global financial crisis and post there’s a lot more regulation now, before it was a different culture really so –"
9Db,9Db_189,A,With government regulation they’re bringing in more and more refinement of what you can – well reporting systems and all that sort of thing.
9Db,9Db_19,Q,"So what sort of expectations do the institutions like the super funds, what did they bring that was new?"
9Db,9Db_190,Q,On the board itself?
9Db,9Db_191,A,"Yeah. So you have to be familiar with that.  Sorry, what was the –"
9Db,9Db_192,Q,"So barriers.  Compared to say pre global financial crisis or post, so barriers to diversity, has it changed?"
9Db,9Db_193,A,"No, I don’t think so. What I think has changed is the broader and subsequent higher investment knowledge of investors combined with the related associated governances. This higher knowledge has subsequently raised investor expectations and progressively necessitated Board makeup to be more diverse to better accommodate the more astute investor sensitivities."
9Db,9Db_194,Q,"You talked about earlier, one thing I picked up was you mentioned, it’s too strong to say cronyism but networks were really important in recruiting people before the financial crisis, but after the culture shifted and the rules shifted, and the influence of your major investors shifted."
9Db,9Db_195,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_196,Q,And that put pressure on you to be more focused on –
9Db,9Db_197,A,"Yes, on people who apply to today’s current market and also governance’s gender diversity, those sorts of things.  I think you’ve just got to review each one in their own respective fields.  I don’t think it necessarily has restricted anybody.  It also depends on the availability of people at the time you’re looking for someone, the availability of that specific type of person you’re looking for.  Sometimes when there’s a booming market in something they drill down on the people who’ve got that experience and you don’t necessarily have a lot of experience in the field you’re looking for because they’ve all been employed somewhere else. So there’s that aspect of it as well."
9Db,9Db_198,Q,So supply -
9Db,9Db_199,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_2,Q,So you’ve got a good idea of the history of development of that board for that period –
9Db,9Db_20,A,I’m trying to think back that far.
9Db,9Db_200,Q,"- more than regulation.  That’s a good point yeah, supply."
9Db,9Db_201,A,"I always used to think geographically you’d want your directors to be in Australia and preferably in Melbourne or Sydney, but that shouldn’t override their experience in bringing to the board.  I used to fly to Sydney all the time.  In my mind I don’t think you’d want a board member overseas."
9Db,9Db_202,Q,"At uni what we do now more and more is rely on technology to bring people into meetings, do they use that in boards?"
9Db,9Db_203,A,"We used to use that for our American joint venture partners over there, but there again there’s nothing like a one on meeting."
9Db,9Db_204,Q,I know –
9Db,9Db_205,A,You and I had a meeting today to find out the real personality.
9Db,9Db_206,Q,"Exactly, yeah I know.  So even at board level decision making that matters?"
9Db,9Db_207,A,"I think so.  You do get a better feel, and again it’s only my personal experience.  I just know from sitting around the table with all those people you get to know their personalities better, what they react to and what they don’t, who’s on their phone in a board meeting and what’s relevant and what’s not to them sort of thing.  You can see that physically.  But technology, yeah for the odd meeting here and there that’s fine."
9Db,9Db_208,Q,You wouldn’t want every meeting to be over Zoom with that person or something?
9Db,9Db_209,A,No.
9Db,9Db_21,Q,"Yes, it was history."
9Db,9Db_210,Q,"I get that.  We’re nearly finished.  From a regulatory perspective how do you feel about the way diversity of boards is currently being promoted?  You mentioned gender targets and quotas to influence board diversity, what do you think about that? Targets I think."
9Db,9Db_211,A,"Absolutely.  Our REIT Fund Manager, I think their total employment was roughly 50/50, overall in, the company itself.  Don’t quote me on it but it’s roughly around 50-60%, and I could see it’s just brought a different dimension to a board and a management structure as well.  I was amazed having worked – I worked for Westfield for many years, and the women were the secretaries in those days, whereas here they’re sitting opposite me in a board meeting today.  And I think it gives a broader levelling point for a lot of discussion and how it’s conducted and all that sort of thing.  Yeah, I think a different type of female mindset to men sometimes, and if the circumstances is good –"
9Db,9Db_212,Q,Can I challenge you to give me an example?
9Db,9Db_213,A,"I’m just trying to think of one.  Where I found it in my experience was that we managed shopping centres and the most dominant people or gender to shop at shopping centres are female.  So they generally brought far more personal experiences than the men, and I know the board, without mentioning any names, none of them shopped weekly. Well I can’t say none of them, but it appeared from conversation that the majority of shopping was done by their wives and I was the only person on the board who did my own weekly shopping because I live on my own. I was familiar with the latest retail trends through my consulting business and you just had to know it from the floor space right up to the Management level about what was going on in retail generally. But generally the female Board members had a far better grasp of all aspects of shopping experience than the men. They generally confirmed my own thoughts!"
9Db,9Db_214,A,"So from that perspective, in my specific board experience, the female perspective was very much appreciated and valued, the men generally had a different mindset.  The men think - well she must do it and knows it, she’s been there, but for other company type boards, apart from their specific qualifications / work experience, I’m not sure what the specific female gender inclusion generally adds to an overall Board experience – perhaps some dignity, common sense and communication skills! I have limited broader knowledge in this area."
9Db,9Db_215,Q,So it’s the different experience that people of different genders can have.
9Db,9Db_216,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_217,Q,That then comes in and shapes how they might problem solve with the board.
9Db,9Db_218,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_219,Q,"They’ll look at it differently, understand it differently.  So even though they might be an accountant or a lawyer they have that knowledge, and then it’s this experience which also comes in which is really dependent on gender, ethnicity –"
9Db,9Db_22,A,"Look, it was probably primarily instigated by their financial planners and that who had a greater depth of knowledge in that.  Maybe there were questions that came up from the clients and then the super funds had to ask more questions.  I’m really not sure exactly how it evolved."
9Db,9Db_220,A,"Yes, they’re probably more – I shouldn’t say this but females are probably more generally family focused so they’re more familiar with getting the message across. I don’t know, I might be wrong in saying that."
9Db,9Db_221,Q,"Okay, so communication style."
9Db,9Db_222,A,"Yeah, they might be better at that, I don’t know. They’ve certainly got their place and I have certainly seen a difference since bringing females on a board and more into management."
9Db,9Db_223,Q,Do you think women have to really - gender equality needs to be at the level of management before it can get to board level?  Do you think one feeds the other?
9Db,9Db_224,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_225,Q,You can’t expect to have gender diverse boards if management is skewed toward males for example?
9Db,9Db_226,A,"Yeah I agree. I think the larger companies promote from within, and if there’s structure correctly and the gender is a good 50/50 mix roughly or whatever or they’re promoting that, then I think they have a better, broader choice of who they pick for the better jobs.  As I said from Trusts Managers perspective I couldn’t believe just how many females they had there and they all just worked together so well."
9Db,9Db_227,Q,And was this because of targets do you think?
9Db,9Db_228,A,"I think initially targets were the instigator, but in the finish – there again I don’t know directly, but I would’ve thought that they saw the results so they kept doing it."
9Db,9Db_229,Q,So it was a good stimulus?
9Db,9Db_23,Q,And were the questions around financial accountability or -
9Db,9Db_230,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_231,Q,"As a regulation it’s a good stimulus and then the proof was in the pudding, it was successful."
9Db,9Db_232,A,"Yes.  I think they just saw that gee, this is all right, so they kept on promoting that type of diverse gender employment because they saw the results were there.  And the blokes who promote your Executives to potential clients, gradually saw that females were just as good in these positions as the men. I haven't been on the office floor space to experience it first hand, but I just got that feeling when I walk up into the Head Office that everybody worked well together."
9Db,9Db_233,Q,Excellent.  Did that take long do you think?
9Db,9Db_234,A,"No. From what I could see it – when the Property Management brought it out about five or six years ago and they then moved to a new open plan office, walking in there for meetings I can just see there was more and more women in the last three to five years."
9Db,9Db_235,Q,So five years you’ve really got an effect and you’ll see it at the board level?
9Db,9Db_236,A,"Yeah, I think so. In the last 3 years of my term, we included our first female Independent Director as well as a Deputy Fund Manager who is an obvious pick for a future Director."
9Db,9Db_237,Q,"Okay.  Do you think there’s a kind of diversity that matters which can’t be measured, like you can’t regulate it in terms of targets or voters?"
9Db,9Db_238,A,"Which can’t be measured, not sure what -"
9Db,9Db_239,Q,"So we’re looking at regulation of boards in terms of diversity, I know you use your head hunters to get people for a cultural fit for example, it would be very hard to set targets to support that wouldn’t it, like the government pass regulation?"
9Db,9Db_24,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_240,A,"Yeah, absolutely. I think the targets come from a company experience, just like I said, that they naturally bring on board more women. I think that’s also come about through the generations there’s more and more women who have got that education experience as well.  So it’s been a natural progression in any case underlying with education.  So there’s just been more and more women come through which have been given those opportunities, whereas before the mum stayed at home and they didn’t have that sort of thing.  So I think it’s a transition of something which is happening in the education sector in any case, and it’s to necessarily forced upon them, it’s just a natural progression."
9Db,9Db_241,Q,That’s right. So it would be unfair in fact if we didn’t have equality.
9Db,9Db_242,A,Yes. If you were a firm that 70-80% are all men there’d be something wrong I would –
9Db,9Db_243,Q,"Yeah, but it might be wrong at the education system rather than – it might be that no women go into engineering."
9Db,9Db_244,A,"Yeah well that could be right too, they may not be in that field.  I’m just trying to think – plumbers."
9Db,9Db_245,Q,Yeah plumbers and engineering and mining and stuff there’s fewer women.  Coming along.
9Db,9Db_246,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_247,Q,"Okay, so the final question is looking 10 years into the future now how would you like to see diversity of Australian boards?"
9Db,9Db_248,A,"In 10 years?  Well I don’t see it changing much from what it currently is, and when I say currently I think in the last three or four years it’s really got into that perspective where boards are balancing more on the gender through what we just discussed.  It’s just a natural progression of women in fields that men are in now and come in. So I can’t see it changing that much because we’re already there."
9Db,9Db_249,Q,"What about going back to the global financial crisis and the conversation we had around crisis, wake up, we don’t know enough about America and their systems, we don’t know enough about whatever else contributed to that crisis where we were caught on our back feet and we lost a lot.  So what about that kind of diversity that you said well now you’d have people who are experienced with the American financial system on board.  So not just gender, now we’re talking all the other sorts of diversity; the skills and backgrounds and experience."
9Db,9Db_25,Q,"- responsible investment, socially responsible -"
9Db,9Db_250,A,What else could change?
9Db,9Db_251,Q,"Yeah, in 10 years time what do you think with that sort of broadened understanding where are we heading?"
9Db,9Db_252,A,"I think it’s more of a world market, so you’ve got to be more familiar with world markets.  But I’m talking in the larger companies, not necessarily a local company. But even so, even if it’s local it certainly is a world market and you’ve got to be more familiar with what’s going on in economies and things like that, and you’ve got to be conscious of all that and how it affects your business.  So I think you’ve probably just got to become more worldly as to the economics and what’s transitioning in the world in terms of trends because it’s going to affect you in some way or another.  How do you get that?  Well you can research it online these days and become aware, you can go and see it firsthand in a country somewhere, but certainly the world is one and we’re affected on a daily basis by what’s happening over the other side of the world somewhere and you’ve got to be up with it and more familiar with it."
9Db,9Db_253,A,"So someone who’s into that and someone who experiences that on a day to day would be more likely to be promoted I suppose, someone who shows experience in that field."
9Db,9Db_254,Q,"We talked about Zoom technology and things like that, that boards might actually have members from different countries and they meet using technology so you don’t have to all fly.  So that would be a very different looking board –"
9Db,9Db_255,A,"Yes.  Look, no doubt there are big large international companies that are Australian based that you must have someone from overseas where they have investments represented, because if you don’t have that then you don’t have the firsthand knowledge of the economy and the firsthand experience of what your investors are thinking. So certainly for big companies - I think I said before you shouldn’t have an overseas director but with those big companies most definitely you have to because they bring that perspective of their local market to the board level.  From that perspective you’ve got to be more worldly I think in your attitude and your knowledge as a board member."
9Db,9Db_256,Q,"Do you think government, it might be law, institutions like the law and banking needs to do something to facilitate this future?"
9Db,9Db_257,A,Not necessarily.  I think the world is so small how everybody travels I think they do it on their own accord.
9Db,9Db_258,Q,"It’s done anyway, yeah."
9Db,9Db_259,A,"From what I can see is that the younger executives of the world, many of them work overseas when they’re younger while they’re travelling and they go and work somewhere and then come back after a few years.  So I think it’s something that’s done in their own time and you don’t necessarily have to promote it.  I think the younger ones see that in any case.  Just about everybody travels these days and they travel when they’re young so they become familiar with more worldly affairs than they used to be.  So I think that’s naturally occurring in any case."
9Db,9Db_26,A,"All those sorts of things, yeah.  With IT coming in and cyber security and all that sort of thing and sustainability, these sorts of things going round the woodwork as well.  The odd thing to do with climate change and what does your company do with refuse removal in my case and how does that get recycled and things like that.  So I think that’s how it evolved, but I think it was a slow process."
9Db,9Db_260,Q,And there are no Australian laws that interfere with this global engaged board?  Not that you’re aware of?
9Db,9Db_261,A,"Not that I’m aware of but it could’ve changed in the last two years for all I know but it’s just I’ve been retired.  I think generally speaking most Australian companies only invest in companies where they know they can identify with their own local laws there which is similar to ours, I’m not saying all of them.  There was a lot of scepticism about going into China initially, but they’ve recently become more westernised in their approach, but there’s still companies that wouldn’t invest in China just yet.  The more westernised and aligned that overseas countries are in the same mentality around governances and things like that, I think that’s just a worldly thing and people would become accustomed to it in any case, be more lenient about it."
9Db,9Db_262,Q,"This is so interesting.  This is the last question, I promise I’m going to let you go.  From an Australian board perspective, let’s say going to China major investment opportunities happening there probably well into the future, the expectation is that they adopt a western type governance framework so that we can engage as Australian –"
9Db,9Db_263,A,Yes.
9Db,9Db_264,Q,"So diversity doesn’t extend to, “Okay, we will learn to play the rules of Confuciun whatever” –"
9Db,9Db_265,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_266,Q,“You really have to fit in with our governance frameworks.”
9Db,9Db_267,A,"Well yeah, it’s got to work both ways obviously, and if you’re a publically listed company you’ve still got to be compliant with all the regulations here which take into consideration what interaction you do overseas. It’s still got to be aligned with Australia –"
9Db,9Db_268,Q,"With our laws, yeah."
9Db,9Db_269,A,"With our laws. As I said there’s a lot of companies that wouldn’t go to China but a lot more do now because – that’s the same with Japan once upon a time, after the war no one would go there but now you do.  So I think things are changing in that way and it’s just becoming a more worldly market overall and you’ve got to be aware of what’s going on around you everywhere, not just in your home country."
9Db,9Db_27,Q,So how important do you think it is to have a diverse board?  Let’s say 10 is extremely important and one is not important at all where would you put it?
9Db,9Db_270,Q,"I think globalisation is a very nice line to finish on which you just finished on, that’s so good.  So unless you have any final comments you’d like to make on board diversity?"
9Db,9Db_271,A,"No. What I did bring, and I don’t know whether you’re aware of these things –"
9Db,9Db_272,Q,Probably not.
9Db,9Db_273,A,Have you seen these skills metrics reports?
9Db,9Db_274,Q,No I haven't but I’ve heard about them.
9Db,9Db_275,A,"This is the last one that I did and I just wanted to show you the types of questions that you – yes, no and a score and all that."
9Db,9Db_276,Q,Brilliant.  Would I be able to have that or is that private?
9Db,9Db_277,A,"It’s not private, no it was up – let me just double check.  I think it’s –"
9Db,9Db_278,Q,No names on it?
9Db,9Db_279,A,No I’m pretty sure they said it was up on the website so they could see because this is the final summary of it.  But that’s the type of question we had.
9Db,9Db_28,A,I’d have to say nine.  I mean if you can describe to me what you mean by diversity that would help me a bit.
9Db,9Db_280,Q,"This is what you’re talking about, the head hunters used to screen people and then you guys –"
9Db,9Db_281,A,"No, no, this is what we as an existing board – about every two years you go through and see whether the board’s up to scratch or not –"
9Db,9Db_282,Q,"To analyse your capacity, your skills."
9Db,9Db_283,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_284,Q,Is that how it’s used?
9Db,9Db_285,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_286,Q,Well if I could – do you want me to check if it’s on the web and if it’s not on the web I can’t use it?
9Db,9Db_287,A,Yes if you could do that because I’m pretty sure it’s up on the website but that’s 2017 or something isn't it?
9Db,9Db_288,Q,"I’ll look for it on the web and if it’s not there then I know I can’t use it.  I’ll say only use if available on web.  Otherwise I can have it as my understanding, so when they say it I know right, that’s what they’re using."
9Db,9Db_289,A,"Yeah.  Board evaluations – yeah, that was brought in around about 2014 I think that boards had to do some formal metrics like that on board skills. Yeah, I think it was 2014."
9Db,9Db_29,Q,"I’m going to ask you what you think because it’s really how you perceive it, not how I do."
9Db,9Db_290,Q,Brought in 2014 to evaluate. So it’s to evaluate your own capacity.
9Db,9Db_291,A,"Yeah. Well that’s something that’s changed because in the early days we were never interviewed on a regular basis by anybody, but then every two years our chairman sat down with us and would say, “Where are we going her? How do you feel about everything?”and you had a meeting, and then this has been up-scaled now to be more formalised for me independently like that.  So that’s the sort of thing that’s changed."
9Db,9Db_292,Q,"I imagine the big investors you talked about, looking at this they think that’s appropriate, this is good."
9Db,9Db_293,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_294,Q,Do they also say the gender mix now?
9Db,9Db_295,A,"They probably do, well they can see it on the annual reports."
9Db,9Db_296,Q,"Yeah right, the annual reports say it."
9Db,9Db_297,A,Well they’ve got all the pictures they have to provide in the annual report.  All the pictures and that are in there.
9Db,9Db_298,Q,And that’s on the web?
9Db,9Db_299,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_3,A,Yeah.
9Db,9Db_30,A,"Well I just think it’s a broad knowledge of all aspects to do with whatever the investment type is.  So in my case it was shopping centres, so my aspect of the board’s specific influence was around shopping centre management and development and all that sort of thing, but of course you have to have people who are good with finance, people who are good with governance issues and all that sort of thing, and they’ve become more specific now on those types of people being on boards.  Finance issues, governance issues, that’s what I said."
9Db,9Db_300,Q,"Okay, that’s brilliant, thank you, I’ve taken more of your time than –"
9Db,9Db_301,A,No that’s all right.  After not being in a board meeting in two years you really have to think about it.
9Db,9Db_302,Q,Don’t worry. I’m going to turn this off so you can -
9Db,9Db_31,Q,So different skills?
9Db,9Db_32,A,"Yes, there are a number of different skills that you have to bring in, and if those specific skills relate to the type of investment you’re doing it’s even better."
9Db,9Db_33,Q,The type of investment?
9Db,9Db_34,A,"Yeah, it’s important that they have some form of knowledge of the type of investment or what the company is investing in, some sort of knowledge in that.  But that’s not always possible, but eventually progressively you bring people into that.  For instance nobody was a specialist in cyber security once upon a time, and now you’ll find there’s more people who have a knowledge and background of that, and that’s in their accounting and economics and things like that they get that."
9Db,9Db_35,Q,"Please have your coffee, I notice you like it very hot.  Okay, that’s good.  Do you think that there is any situational context that might cause you to change that importance rating you gave?  So maybe high uncertainty, high risk you think oh well diversity is not as important in that situation."
9Db,9Db_36,A,I can’t think of any but as I said to you had I been involved on a number of boards that may raise a few issues but -
9Db,9Db_37,Q,"We’re getting across a number of people, so from your experience in this board no. That’s good.  So what does board diversity mean to you?  So skills, what about there’s a lot of talk about cognitive diversity and that’s like different approaches to problem solving, ways of thinking, so it’s not so much the skills.  Does that matter?"
9Db,9Db_38,A,"It’s thinking outside the box a bit, is that what you mean?"
9Db,9Db_39,Q,"Exactly, that sort of thing yeah so as everyone’s not on the -"
9Db,9Db_4,Q,"So that’s really a unique perspective which won’t show up as an identifier, but you have a good historical perspective so that’s really useful.  So thank you very much.  My understanding is that you recently -"
9Db,9Db_40,A,"Yeah, well that generally forms part of your management team under the board to initiate those sorts of things, but it’s certainly helpful if you can find someone who has that capacity to think outside the square, and I’m not saying that they’re not, it’s just generally I’ve noted in my experience that the board members that I associated with, they’re generally over 60 at least and because cyber and because of digitalisation and things like that are a new form of control and that sort of thing in businesses, they’re not fully aware of the updating and all that and they rely on management to bring that through  to them."
9Db,9Db_41,A,"To a large degree, I’m not saying all. But it’s just evolving so fast that it’s hard to find people who have all that experience of a younger person who’s just learning all that type of thing and being involved with it on a day to day basis."
9Db,9Db_42,Q,"Do you think having a mix of age on the board is good then, diversity in terms of age?"
9Db,9Db_43,A,"Yes, most definitely."
9Db,9Db_44,Q,What about gender?
9Db,9Db_45,A,"Whatever, if the person fits the bill whatever gender."
9Db,9Db_46,Q,It’s more irrelevant than -
9Db,9Db_47,A,"Yes, it’s more important to have the people who are experienced so if the gender, male or female fits that bit you go with that."
9Db,9Db_48,Q,"Now there’s been a recent inclusion of ethnicity, sexual orientation, do you think those kinds of diversity matter or once again back to the depends on the skills?"
9Db,9Db_49,A,"Not necessarily.  I think first and foremost its skills, then if someone with whatever background then fits that bill well - in my experience when I retired from the board, I know the person who replaced me, he was a gay man, but a very well experienced person."
9Db,9Db_5,A,Retired.
9Db,9Db_50,Q,"It wasn’t because he was gay, it’s because of his -"
9Db,9Db_51,A,"No, very experienced."
9Db,9Db_52,Q,"Okay.  We’ve talked about different kinds of diversity, skills - you’ve really come down to skills, that’s the most important, so I’m going to say does a particular kind of diversity matter more than others?"
9Db,9Db_53,A,Skills and knowledge of the investment that you’re in.
9Db,9Db_54,Q,"Skills and knowledge, okay beautiful.  Now we want to understand a bit about the board functioning and how diversity works there.  Are there particular board functions that you think diversity can really help with, so having the diverse skills and knowledge, and also can you give me an example, a story?"
9Db,9Db_55,A,Let me think.  Again I can only refer to my position -
9Db,9Db_56,Q,"Yeah, do."
9Db,9Db_57,A,"In my experience in management of real estate and development of real estate I’m thinking ask more direct questions to the management of any company, and you can drill down on them and make them more accountable for what they present to you at board  meetings.  So again from my experience I could go right down to the finer points of management, leasing and development, and they were aware that if they came to our board meetings, the management side of things, then they would be asked questions and sometimes that’ll be out of leftfield.  So they had to be properly prepared for all sorts of circumstances and questions.  Does that answer your question?"
9Db,9Db_58,Q,"Yeah it does.  So the particular skill that you brought, that skill and knowledge, that enabled the board to make potential investors much more accountable or the board’s decisions more accountable because you could really understand the offering, is that how you’d sort of -"
9Db,9Db_59,A,"Yes.  Well the investors relied upon you as an independent director to ask those questions on their behalf essentially.  So they had to see, and there are new platforms being set up more recently whereby investors can convey their thoughts to these specific external platforms who question the knowledge and the broad spectrum of what their experience is and what their board runs and manages.  So these platforms directly ask the questions on behalf of the investors why is this done, why isn't that being done, boom, boom, boom.  And more particularly when a board member has come up for re-election they put their two bob’s worth in, so what their investors should think of him or whatever, take your vote this way or that way."
9Db,9Db_6,Q,"Yeah, you recently retired from the board, but we’ll consider it - was it a not for profit or for profit?"
9Db,9Db_60,A,"So there’s more and more of that, but we found also that for overseas investors they were using people who just asked the question from far away, these sorts of things, and weren’t very familiar with the actual person who was on the board who was an independent director, whereas the Australian people could actually link with them and have a chat to them and become more familiar with what they were all about.  So they weren’t necessarily a good representation for their investors to take on board their opinions, and we found there were some issues with that, that they were really pushing the wrong barrel.  I mean they were trying to get rid of some directors whose turn was up but they were really very, very good and even the local investors thought they were very, very good, but because of the isolation of the people doing the enquiries they got it wrong in a lot of things."
9Db,9Db_61,Q,Okay.  So is this like a social media platform?
9Db,9Db_62,A,"No, it’s a -"
9Db,9Db_63,Q,What’s it called?
9Db,9Db_64,A,"I’m just trying to think of the description, what they do there.  It’s a body that sort of investigates companies and their boards and their structures and all that sort of thing, and gives independent opinions on where it’s going and what’s currently relevant. I’ve forgotten the actual name that they use for it. Proxy Advisors, that’s it. It’s a more recent thing."
9Db,9Db_66,Q,"Okay, so we’re onto here.  So conversely are there board functions that diversity can limit or undermine? So having people from different background and skills on your board, do you think that can undermine or reduce the function of your board decision making et cetera?"
9Db,9Db_67,A,"I haven't experienced that.  I think a lot of it is to do with also who the chairman is and his willingness to create an environment with the board that encourages questions and openness.  I think if you’ve got a good chairman and he does that then you find that everything comes to the surface, whatever the issue whether personal issues with particular people/management, or the way it’s run, anything like that.  I think the chairman has a key role and if you have a person that does that and encourages that sort of thing then I think it’s a smoother board and there’s more openness in it.  Does that answer the question?"
9Db,9Db_68,Q,Yeah that’s really good.  So the chair really creates an open culture so that everyone – and that marries with -
9Db,9Db_69,A,"Yeah, it’s an inclusion of everybody’s thoughts and -"
9Db,9Db_7,A,"For profit, yeah."
9Db,9Db_70,Q,Beautiful.  Do you think that sort of inclusive culture on the board is essential for diversity to work?
9Db,9Db_71,A,"Yes, I think it’s good to have people who assimilate with that and also have an openness towards that.  In general they are.  Just to get to that position those people have that sort of culture in them in any case that they’re, aggressive is the wrong word, but you don’t get to that position if you’re a quiet person sitting on the board.  They generally have that in their day to day mindset in any case to do that sort of thing."
9Db,9Db_72,Q,"Their DNA is to get involved, but what about to be respectful of other people’s points of view?"
9Db,9Db_73,A,"Yes I think that’s inbuilt into them.  They may not agree with them but they do respect them, yeah.  I think at that level generally people deliver that type of thing, they’re quite respectful of each other.  And again that’s a chairman to run the meeting so it is respectful I think, that’s his job."
9Db,9Db_74,Q,"Do you have rules of how to be, how to listen to each other, is there an explicit value statement or anything to guide this on a board or -"
9Db,9Db_75,A,"No, I’ve never heard of one."
9Db,9Db_76,Q,I’m hoping it’s not needed but anyway.
9Db,9Db_77,A,"I think that’s all in your initial selection of a new board member and the culture that you’re trying to create within a board, and you only take on people who maybe fit with that culture to a certain degree."
9Db,9Db_78,Q,"And that culture is not people of the same ilk, it’s -"
9Db,9Db_79,A,"Yes, it’s a culture of being expressive and air your viewpoints and listen to others and take on board everybody’s opinions. Well that’s how our board used to work, we only took on people that had that sort of expression within them, and when you interviewed them you hinted at that to see if they had that sort of culture in them.  But I think that’s really how it works, yeah."
9Db,9Db_8,Q,And was it in finance industry?
9Db,9Db_80,Q,"We’ve got a section we’re coming to on selection so I think we’ll hold that point and just look at is there – some people think that diversity can contribute to conflict on the board, I’m just wondering if you’ve seen that, I mean there must be disagreement, and if so how was that conflict managed?  Can you recall a situation where -"
9Db,9Db_81,A,"I think the more issues that arise between directors whether you’d call it conflict or debate I think the better.  There’s a process that you have a vote at the end of the day to put issues through, so ultimately it ends up it’s all done in the correct manner in any case, in an organised manner."
9Db,9Db_82,Q,"I’m really keen to know because in theory they use words like conflict not debate, and I’m really interested because I intuitively understand there’s a difference, can you describe the difference on the board, this is a debate, this is conflict? Can you give me a -"
9Db,9Db_83,A,I’m trying to think of whether that ever arose.
9Db,9Db_84,Q,"Even make it up, what would it be? Conflict’s like this -"
9Db,9Db_85,A,"Yes well again the conflict would be between the independent directors and the directors, and in my case we had a trust of properties and it was managed externally.  So the other board, the other directors representing the management company, the conflict that we had if any was fee structure, that we had to pay them a fee and it was based on this.  But when that occurred we went out to independent advisors to research the day to day market on fee structures to come up with, “Is it right, is it on par or what is it with the rest of the market?” and generally speaking it was.  As I say they were independent advisors who did that for us on behalf of the directors.  So that’s probably the only real conflict that we had was always assessing fee structures."
9Db,9Db_86,A,"The management company also had 16% equity in the fund in any case, so they did have money to be lost if that was the case, if there was any incorrect decision or something which swayed their way and not investor’s ways.  But as I said there’s always independent advisors that you can call in if there was a conflict and we could resolve it with, “Well this is what the outcome was, do you accept it or don’t you accept it?” basically.  And any type of conflict you can do that, you can have independent advisors on that sort of thing."
9Db,9Db_87,Q,"So probably conflict would be linked to resourcing decisions, money in the end?"
9Db,9Db_88,A,Well I don’t know what other companies would say but that was the difference between our board and -
9Db,9Db_89,Q,That is so good.  I’m hoping that in future interviews I’ll see if I can find other examples because that is really good.
9Db,9Db_9,A,No it was in the property sector; shopping centre.
9Db,9Db_90,A,"Yeah, well that was always a key issue, and investors when we met with them they always raised that issue, “What about the fees?  Are they correct, are they market fees?” and I’d say, “Yeah, here’s the report, we have done boom, boom, boom, this is how they assessed it.”"
9Db,9Db_91,Q,So it’s a conflict basically between the investor interest and the management interest?
9Db,9Db_92,A,Mm.
9Db,9Db_93,Q,And you’re the meat in the sandwich really.
9Db,9Db_94,A,"We’re the meat in the sandwich and that’s what we’re there for, we’re there to represent them."
9Db,9Db_95,Q,"Yeah, and you help to resolve it by having an external independent advisor."
9Db,9Db_96,A,Yeah -
9Db,9Db_97,Q,That is a really neat idea.
9Db,9Db_98,A,And that happened on quite a number of occasions with different types of issues.  I’m just trying to think of another one.
9Db,9Db_99,Q,That’s good because it’s an evidence based independent rational process -
