139,139,10D,10D_144,10D_144_sent0,A,I was on a board some years ago where the chair was ineffective,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0

142,142,10D,10D_144,10D_144_sent3,A, And what [inaudible] 00:39:25 it took a couple of months to recoup it,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
143,143,10D,10D_145,10D_145_sent0,A,But what it pointed out was it was a bit dysfunctional and that this particular chair was not performing right,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
144,144,10D,10D_145,10D_145_sent1,A, So that led to a whole set of different conversations,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1823,1823,12D correcte,12D correcte_206,12D correcte_206_sent0,A,Now look I’d selfishly say it would be fantastic if there was more support for young people,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

1854,1854,12D correcte,12D correcte_24,12D correcte_24_sent2,A," So I think for them it was an opportunity, and I don't know completely, but I think for them it was an opportunity to get insight from people that they believed were important part of their community into the various elements of governance",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
1855,1855,12D correcte,12D correcte_24,12D correcte_24_sent3,A," And whilst two of us didn't stay on in the long term, one of them is – I believe she was still with the board last time I checked",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

1868,1868,12D correcte,12D correcte_32,12D correcte_32_sent1,A, I felt like it might be more useful when I had more practical experience,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
1869,1869,12D correcte,12D correcte_32,12D correcte_32_sent2,A," I felt like maybe – and whilst I thought that was a fantastic experience, it was also in some ways quite difficult because I was privy only to a portion of what the board was doing",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
1870,1870,12D correcte,12D correcte_32,12D correcte_32_sent3,A," So being involved with one subcommittee did make it – I felt incredibly useful and like I was contributing, but I didn't feel like I had good oversight over everything the organisation was doing",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
1871,1871,12D correcte,12D correcte_32,12D correcte_32_sent4,A, So I personally didn't feel like it was the right time for the company director’s course with the AICD,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1884,1884,12D correcte,12D correcte_38,12D correcte_38_sent1,A," Because I'm just thinking these are barriers to come up with ten thousand plus for a course for an unpaid role, it's a lot to ask if someone's you know put a HECS debt and you know often other expenses like mortgages might be coming on the horizon",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
1885,1885,12D correcte,12D correcte_39,12D correcte_39_sent0,A,I mean I appreciate that and why I hesitated once I said maybe this is a young person's issue,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
1886,1886,12D correcte,12D correcte_39,12D correcte_39_sent1,A," Everybody has different expenses and we can never really know, so I think it could be prohibitively high for many people regardless of their age",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

1895,1895,12D correcte,12D correcte_40,12D correcte_40_sent1,Q, But for someone young it's probably across the board,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

1904,1904,12D correcte,12D correcte_41,12D correcte_41_sent4,A, So in some cases I actually felt that I needed to inform my workplace so that they wouldn't be concerned with conflicts or – conflicts of interest or also just conflicts in time and commitment,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
1905,1905,12D correcte,12D correcte_41,12D correcte_41_sent5,A, I had those conversations when I first stepped into the advisory role with A YOUTH ORGANISATION,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
1906,1906,12D correcte,12D correcte_41,12D correcte_41_sent6,A, And they were supportive but there was certainly an expectation that your role is what comes first and we expect you to perform that well,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

1911,1911,12D correcte,12D correcte_43,12D correcte_43_sent2,A, But that's been the same experience with THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL BOARD and I think that's reflective of the fact that many board members have day jobs that they are meant to get to as well,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
1912,1912,12D correcte,12D correcte_43,12D correcte_43_sent3,A, So I guess that's a consideration for everybody,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

5801,5801,1D,1D_121,1D_121_sent2,The participant," How you would – yeah, because you don’t typically pick board members based on where they grew up in primary school and how poor or rick their parents were",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

5831,5831,1D,1D_128,1D_128_sent1,The participant," It’s almost the easy way that you appear to get diversity because we do – the board will kind of decide – so for example, I’m in the Labour Party, and we were just voting for the executive",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

5834,5834,1D,1D_128,1D_128_sent4,The participant," Like a family structures is usually balanced – you just naturally feel that – and then if gender isn’t an issue, if you’ve broadly got it balanced, then you just cast the selection out just generally",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
5835,5835,1D,1D_128,1D_128_sent5,The participant, But I think we’ve got well-established processes for bringing women on boards now,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

5838,5838,1D,1D_128,1D_128_sent8,The participant," So I think that kind of diversity, in the boards that I’m dealing with, is pretty easy to get",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

5840,5840,1D,1D_129,1D_129_sent1,The participant," I think that’s another level of competency that – so yeah, but you do go to the [AICD]",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
5841,5841,1D,1D_129,1D_129_sent2,The participant, You do go to the Financial Review,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

5844,5844,1D,1D_129,1D_129_sent5,The participant, So that’s a little bit of a financial barrier,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5845,5845,1D,1D_129,1D_129_sent6,The participant," The way I got the TAFE one, was I was in the Financial Review",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

5852,5852,1D,1D_129,1D_129_sent13,The participant, So I knew which TAFEs needed the governance,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

5856,5856,1D,1D_130,1D_130_sent1,The participant," So there’s a lot of good people, I imagine, that wouldn’t – like this Somali guy, he wouldn’t have access to those networks or even [Sue], the ophthalmologist, who’s had to – yeah",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
5857,5857,1D,1D_131,1D_131_sent0,Margo,So do you as a board member influence the selection? Or the candidates?,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5858,5858,1D,1D_132,1D_132_sent0,The participant,So typically what happens is you get a subcommittee,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5859,5859,1D,1D_132,1D_132_sent1,The participant, So you’ll have – it’ll be a renumeration committee and there’ll be one or two people that will interview,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

6157,6157,1D,1D_202,1D_202_sent0,The participant,And the other thing I wanted to say – this is something that I’m very interested in,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6158,6158,1D,1D_202,1D_202_sent1,The participant, And it is – I’ve got a theory that in every organisation there’ll be a scapegoat,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

6417,6417,1D,1D_26,1D_26_sent8,Margo," So The participant, there’s a lot of talk about board diversity, but we’re interested to hear from you because you sit on an Australian board, and so we’re interested in that perspective",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

6429,6429,1D,1D_267,1D_267_sent0,Paul,"Well, essentially, The participant, on the [AICD] course recently, or in the last year anyway – and [well I think that inaudible] 01:32:20 for matrices that have the competency and then they’ve put behavioural as well",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6430,6430,1D,1D_267,1D_267_sent1,Paul, But they don’t necessarily identify behaviour [or trace] 01:32:30 it could vary from organisation to organisation,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6431,6431,1D,1D_267,1D_267_sent2,Paul," And I really think – what I’ve heard from the big end of town where they’ve looked at that, it is more about fit",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

6436,6436,1D,1D_267,1D_267_sent7,Paul, And it tends to get teased out – it’s not very scientific,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

6487,6487,1D,1D_274,1D_274_sent1,The participant," I’ve got too many team players and right now, status quo is completely not what’s needed",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6488,6488,1D,1D_274,1D_274_sent2,The participant," And yeah, so your point is really well made",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6489,6489,1D,1D_274,1D_274_sent3,The participant, You need different types and you can fail if you don’t have that kind of thing in there,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6490,6490,1D,1D_274,1D_274_sent4,The participant, But very good,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6491,6491,1D,1D_274,1D_274_sent5,The participant," All right, look, thank you",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
6492,6492,1D,1D_274,1D_274_sent6,The participant, It’s very – and I do apologise that I’ve got no – [audio ends abruptly],1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
6493,6493,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent0,The participant,"So, look, diversity is really important",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6494,6494,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent1,The participant," And one of the reasons it’s really important, one of the things that happened recently is we had to sack a CEO",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6495,6495,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent2,The participant," And CEOs tread this very fine line between risking enough to get a business going – because they have to be go-getters, and they have to be a type of person that is a go-getter – and to be a conservative person that keeps everything together",0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
6496,6496,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent3,The participant, And sometimes I’ve seen that that mix doesn’t work,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6497,6497,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent4,The participant, And you do need a board to oversee that,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6498,6498,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent5,The participant," And you do need – when you’re kind of assessing whether a CEO is balancing on that line, whether he’s doing enough risk and he’s doing enough keeping the whole thing together – so you can have problems either way",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6499,6499,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent6,The participant, You can have a CEO that’s not trying hard enough and not risking enough,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
6500,6500,1D,1D_28,1D_28_sent7,The participant, Or you can have a CEO that’s actually gone a little bit crazy,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6501,6501,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent0,The participant,"And to assess that, you kind of need a trial by jury, in a way",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6502,6502,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent1,The participant, If that makes sense,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6503,6503,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent2,The participant, Because it’s a very hard decision to make,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
6504,6504,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent3,The participant, Whether they’re making enough bets or whether they’re making the right bets,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6505,6505,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent4,The participant, And obviously the boards main job is to appoint a CEO and make sure that their performance is keeping to track,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
6506,6506,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent5,The participant," And then the rest is monitoring and governance, but that’s the really hard job",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
6507,6507,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent6,The participant," And I suppose if you’re going to – it’s not trial by jury, but it almost is",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6508,6508,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent7,The participant," If you’re going to have that, you do need more than just one type of person to do that",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
6509,6509,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent8,The participant," You need someone that’s – so in the NFP organisation , which is mostly about resources and giving programs to disadvantaged women and girls, you need people that are good on that front, on the social front",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6510,6510,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent9,The participant," You need people that are good on law, especially law",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6511,6511,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent10,The participant, You need people good on accounting,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6512,6512,1D,1D_29,1D_29_sent11,The participant," You need people who are really hooked into government, because government funding is crucial",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6513,6513,1D,1D_3,1D_3_sent0,The participant,Yeah,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
6514,6514,1D,1D_3,1D_3_sent1,The participant, Sure,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6515,6515,1D,1D_30,1D_30_sent0,The participant,So you need that diversity of skills and you need the diversity of attitudes and ability to judge whether someone’s doing an okay job,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6516,6516,1D,1D_30,1D_30_sent1,The participant," Because apart from anything else, CEOS almost are always very clever",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6517,6517,1D,1D_30,1D_30_sent2,The participant," And they're very, very good at marketing, especially self-marketing",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6518,6518,1D,1D_30,1D_30_sent3,The participant," So yeah, I suppose I see it in that way",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6519,6519,1D,1D_30,1D_30_sent4,The participant," It’s not a trial by jury, but kind of like that",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
6520,6520,1D,1D_31,1D_31_sent0,Margo,"Okay, so you’ve mentioned that board diversity is like the capacities of the different people",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
6521,6521,1D,1D_31,1D_31_sent1,Margo, So a functional diversity with different people on the board,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6522,6522,1D,1D_31,1D_31_sent2,Margo," But also their relationships, like networks to government",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6523,6523,1D,1D_31,1D_31_sent3,Margo," But then you’ve also brought in that third kind of diversity, which seems to be like the relationship between the board and the management",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6524,6524,1D,1D_31,1D_31_sent4,Margo," And that you have to be able to be flexible to manage – like board by jury, which is quite independent",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6525,6525,1D,1D_31,1D_31_sent5,Margo, And then is there another way that the board can relate to management? The chief executive?,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6526,6526,1D,1D_32,1D_32_sent0,The participant,"Well, I mean, it has to go through",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6527,6527,1D,1D_32,1D_32_sent1,The participant," You have to be very – I mean, the [tricker] 00:06:31 model I think, because that’s the one that says you go through the CEO, doesn’t it?",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6528,6528,1D,1D_33,1D_33_sent0,Margo,Yeah,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
6529,6529,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent0,The participant,"Yeah, that seems to be the one that is workable that I’ve seen",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6530,6530,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent1,The participant," I do have a relationship with the CFO – with the two CFOs, just because I’m finance-based",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6531,6531,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent2,The participant," But there’s kind of an approval process that I’ve seen that you go through the chair, and the CEO, and you say look, just functionally I need to do this",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6532,6532,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent3,The participant, If it’s anything important I will cc – I will courtesy copy both of you,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
6533,6533,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent4,The participant, It’s by appointment,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6534,6534,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent5,The participant, It’s by exception,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
6535,6535,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent6,The participant, So you do have that relationship with management,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
6536,6536,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent7,The participant, But a lot of it does filter through the CEO,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6537,6537,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent8,The participant," And I mean, it’s a hard job, because CEOs have to manage – there’s 12 people on both boards",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
6538,6538,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent9,The participant, It’s such a hard job to do,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
6539,6539,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent10,The participant, And you don’t want loose ends,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6540,6540,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent11,The participant," As much as possible, you want to give them the capability of managing you to the extent possible",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6541,6541,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent12,The participant," So you do – yeah, I mean, that’s why everything goes through the chair",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6542,6542,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent13,The participant, And the chair’s job does seem to be five times harder than being on a board,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6543,6543,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent14,The participant," And I think a chair’s job, you need 10 years of experience on a board to be a good chair, in my opinion",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6544,6544,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent15,The participant," I wouldn’t be experienced enough, for example",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6545,6545,1D,1D_34,1D_34_sent16,The participant," Yeah, so the diversity mixes in, in that framework if that makes sense",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
6546,6546,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent0,Paul,"Yeah, [inaudible] 00:07:57 so do a large degree what you’re describing, to a large degree is more functional line, so say for like the Australian Institute of Company Directors recommend that a lot of boards create their own skills matrices for example",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6547,6547,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent1,Paul," Where [inaudible] 00:08:14 organisation, some people within the social world, some people who are the legal, financial – sometimes a combination, et cetera, et cetera",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6548,6548,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent2,Paul, And the debate that’s going on with diversity at the moment – and we accept that,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6549,6549,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent3,Paul," I mean, that’s understood",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6550,6550,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent4,Paul," That’s obviously important – is also around other attributes such as gender, ethnicity, possibly age",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6551,6551,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent5,Paul, But particularly gender and ethnicity,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6552,6552,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent6,Paul, And gender I think is what gets most of the spotlight,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6553,6553,1D,1D_35,1D_35_sent7,Paul," Is that sort of diversity important, do you think?",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6554,6554,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent0,The participant,"Yeah, look, just by way of background – and obviously – so my two chairs are women",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6555,6555,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent1,The participant, My bosses at La Trobe are women,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6556,6556,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent2,The participant, My boss here is a woman,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6557,6557,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent3,The participant, My wife is an extremely competent woman,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6558,6558,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent4,The participant," I accept that there’s a controversy around it, but for me that controversy has – it’s almost – it’s not irrelevant, because I just think you do want women there",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
6559,6559,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent5,The participant," And yeah – just you want them there, as just a part of a natural process I think",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6560,6560,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent6,The participant," It’s not – I haven’t been a part of a process where they’ve pushed for women to be on there, because the boards that I’m on are half and half",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6561,6561,1D,1D_36,1D_36_sent7,The participant, And it’s just a natural -,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6562,6562,1D,1D_37,1D_37_sent0,Margo,Hasn’t been an issue?,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6563,6563,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent0,The participant,It hasn’t been an issue,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6564,6564,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent1,The participant," So I know that you say there’s controversy, and the big end of town is probably there – and I haven’t got experience in that, but the not for profit space and the places that I play, it is – and I’ve had a number of chairs on both of them",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6565,6565,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent2,The participant, And I really can’t see – the woman chair at the moment for  not for profit organisation– before that there was two main chairs,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6566,6566,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent3,The participant, She’s the best one we’ve had,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6567,6567,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent4,The participant," And maybe it’s attributable to gender, but maybe it’s attributable to the fact that she was the chair of Brotherhood of St Laurence, she’s just very competent in that social space",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
6568,6568,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent5,The participant, So I do look at it through the prism of competency rather than – and I also look at it through emotional lenses,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6569,6569,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent6,The participant, So there will be very specific people that are empathic,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
6570,6570,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent7,The participant, There will be very specific people that are detailed and analytical,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6571,6571,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent8,The participant, And I think you want that,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6572,6572,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent9,The participant," So I’m not answering the question, I think, the way you want it answered, Paul",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6573,6573,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent10,The participant, But I do see it as an non-issue where I’m at,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6574,6574,1D,1D_38,1D_38_sent11,The participant, And so I don’t know whether that’s politically correct or anything,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6575,6575,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent0,Paul,[inaudible] 00:11:18 That’s fine,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6576,6576,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent1,Paul," But just to say, a lot of the questions that Margo will be going through moving forward – I mean, not necessarily buying into a debate on one side or the other or whatever",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6577,6577,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent2,Paul, We’re just trying to [understand] 00:11:34 some of the issues here,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6578,6578,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent3,Paul," When we talk about diversity and diversity in terms of their competence is assumed as important, but we’re also thinking in terms of gender diversity",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6579,6579,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent4,Paul, Because your boards are [clearly pretty diverse] 00:11:53 which is fine,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
6580,6580,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent5,Paul, Other boards aren’t,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6581,6581,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent6,Paul, Some are extremely – you know,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
6582,6582,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent7,Paul, [inaudible] 00:12:00 But also not just gender,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6583,6583,1D,1D_39,1D_39_sent8,Paul," It’s things like ethnic [inaudible] 00:12:08 people from overseas on boards, which may makes sense in certain circumstances and/or any other 00:12:19 of diversity that make up demand",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6584,6584,1D,1D_4,1D_4_sent0,Paul,Now we’ve got [inaudible] 00:00:20 on our screen I can’t see either Margo or you,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6585,6585,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent0,The participant,Yeah,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
6586,6586,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent1,The participant," So one of the things I think is missing on boards a little bit in Australia that isn’t missing in America is a performance – so sometimes you have boards that are very not diverse, because they’ll have eighth of the 12 people will be very compliance based",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
6587,6587,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent2,The participant, And you’ll get a board that gets stuck in this compliance,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6588,6588,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent3,The participant, And really you want to – I think you want a board to help performance as well,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6589,6589,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent4,The participant, So you have that compliance/performance crossover,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6590,6590,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent5,The participant," So in America you have an expression, you either give money, you get money, or you get out",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6591,6591,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent6,The participant, So in a way that’s a very harsh way of saying American boards are – they will try and help the CEO on the performance side,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6592,6592,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent7,The participant, My experience of what I’ve seen on Australian boards is that we don’t have that compliance/performance thing quite worked out yet,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6593,6593,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent8,The participant, So I don’t think we have diversity in that way,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6594,6594,1D,1D_40,1D_40_sent9,The participant, I know that’s – but I’m happy to answer as many gender questions as you want,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
6595,6595,1D,1D_41,1D_41_sent0,Margo,Yeah,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

6597,6597,1D,1D_41,1D_41_sent2,Margo, We’re not limited to gender,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
6598,6598,1D,1D_41,1D_41_sent3,Margo, It’s -,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6599,6599,1D,1D_42,1D_42_sent0,Paul,[inaudible] 00:13:30 we’re not focused on gender,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6600,6600,1D,1D_43,1D_43_sent0,Margo,"Yeah, yeah",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
6601,6601,1D,1D_43,1D_43_sent1,Margo, Definitely not,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6602,6602,1D,1D_43,1D_43_sent2,Margo, Some people like you think it’s a non-issue because 48% or 50% of women are on boards,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6603,6603,1D,1D_43,1D_43_sent3,Margo, Represent the boards,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

6605,6605,1D,1D_43,1D_43_sent5,Margo, So we’ll be looking at why do you think that’s not the case,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

6616,6616,1D,1D_48,1D_48_sent2,The participant," In a way, one of the limitations of being on a board is that you don’t know very much",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

6619,6619,1D,1D_48,1D_48_sent5,The participant, But in some respects you don’t know enough to add value for one or two years,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6620,6620,1D,1D_48,1D_48_sent6,The participant," So you might know in your space – so once again, I suppose I do stress that competency and skills",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
6621,6621,1D,1D_48,1D_48_sent7,The participant, And the other one is that emotional diversity and the attitude diversity,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6622,6622,1D,1D_48,1D_48_sent8,The participant, So I think you do need that for assessment of the CEO,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

6625,6625,1D,1D_49,1D_49_sent1,The participant," Wanted to really expand out and start a business that he could name – that he could put his name to and his sort of – well, he’s 50 and he wanted to say in the next 10 years, I want to be a super success",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6626,6626,1D,1D_49,1D_49_sent2,The participant, And I’m happy [inaudible] 00:15:30 but I’m bluffing on two tens or something like that,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

6630,6630,1D,1D_49,1D_49_sent6,The participant," But to make those kind of – and we ended up saying, actually you’ve gone way too far",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6631,6631,1D,1D_49,1D_49_sent7,The participant, You need to stop,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

6635,6635,1D,1D_49,1D_49_sent11,The participant," So to make that decision, it’s really hard",1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
6636,6636,1D,1D_49,1D_49_sent12,The participant, The board was divided,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

6642,6642,1D,1D_50,1D_50_sent1,Margo, There’s a few questions around how that – so we can drill down into that process later on,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
6643,6643,1D,1D_50,1D_50_sent2,Margo, That’s really good,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
6644,6644,1D,1D_50,1D_50_sent3,Margo, So you feel that the board’s diversity has have a positive effect on the decision making,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

6646,6646,1D,1D_50,1D_50_sent5,Margo, Particularly in this – the assessment of the CEO as an example,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
6647,6647,1D,1D_50,1D_50_sent6,Margo, So that’s great,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
6648,6648,1D,1D_50,1D_50_sent7,Margo, So do you feel the board diversity can negatively impact the board’s performance?,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6649,6649,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent0,The participant,It has to have a strong chair,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6650,6650,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent1,The participant, A lot depends on the competency of the chair,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
6651,6651,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent2,The participant," And the chair – so when you’re in a board, and I know you both know this, you’ve got 12 people and you’re looking around for a natural leader",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6652,6652,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent3,The participant," And if you’ve got – like we’ve got a managing partner of a law firm there, and everyone kind of looks over to him every 20 seconds, just to make sure everything is okay",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
6653,6653,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent4,The participant," So if you’ve got a strong chair that can give everyone a voice – so when I’m on the board, I always say to myself, I’m going to be the fourth or the fifth person that’s going to talk",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6654,6654,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent5,The participant, I’m not the most skilled,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
6655,6655,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent6,The participant, But I do have value that I can add,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6656,6656,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent7,The participant, And there’ll be a few people that don’t want to talk on an issue,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6657,6657,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent8,The participant, But a chair’s got to allow that,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6658,6658,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent9,The participant, There will be natural leaders in there and the chair does have to be one of those natural leaders to bring that diversity,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6659,6659,1D,1D_51,1D_51_sent10,The participant, Otherwise it’s a bit of a rabble,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
6660,6660,1D,1D_52,1D_52_sent0,The participant,"Now, I’ve been lucky and had very good chairs",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
6661,6661,1D,1D_52,1D_52_sent1,The participant," So I haven’t seen – but it is a very complex task to be able to manage 12 people who are different levels of competency, but you’re not really on a board if you’re not broadly competent",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
6662,6662,1D,1D_52,1D_52_sent2,The participant," I mean, there’s not too many – so yeah, you’ve got to manage – you’ve got to herd those chickens",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6663,6663,1D,1D_52,1D_52_sent3,The participant," And if you can do that, and you’ve picked your chair and the chair has been picked well, then I think diversity is a strength",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6664,6664,1D,1D_53,1D_53_sent0,Margo,"Okay, so how do we pick a chair?",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
6665,6665,1D,1D_54,1D_54_sent0,The participant,"Yeah, I think you let the natural – a natural leader will emerge",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6666,6666,1D,1D_54,1D_54_sent1,The participant, And as much as possible you should let that natural leader be the chair,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
6667,6667,1D,1D_54,1D_54_sent2,The participant," So I’m not – yeah, so [ Chair], 00:18:36 who’s the chair on the This NFP board, she’s got an Order of Australia",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
6668,6668,1D,1D_54,1D_54_sent3,The participant, She’s extremely experienced in this space,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6669,6669,1D,1D_54,1D_54_sent4,The participant, And so it was just natural that we would defer to her in that case,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6670,6670,1D,1D_55,1D_55_sent0,Margo,She’s was on the board?,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

6673,6673,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent2,The participant, She’s not on the board at the moment,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6674,6674,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent3,The participant, So the board understands,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
6675,6675,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent4,The participant," So you don’t want to have, oh it’s his turn or it’s her turn",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6676,6676,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent5,The participant, You want to be able to control that process to the best of your ability,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6677,6677,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent6,The participant," Not control it, you want it to be – you don’t want the natural leader to be someone who’s part-time and not on the board",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6678,6678,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent7,The participant, Unless that person has deferred a lot of authority to the chair,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6679,6679,1D,1D_56,1D_56_sent8,The participant, And then they have to be quite respectful,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
6680,6680,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent0,The participant,"So I have seen, for example, I’ve seen a CEO sacked because – and they were a great CEO",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
6681,6681,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent1,The participant," This was a woman CEO, man chair",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6682,6682,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent2,The participant," And she was having a coffee and said oh, I’m not very sure about the competency of the chair",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6683,6683,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent3,The participant, And she was right,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
6684,6684,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent4,The participant, But you can’t interfere with the natural authority of the chair,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6685,6685,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent5,The participant," And the chair heard this and the chair said look, I can’t have a board where you’ve said that in public",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6686,6686,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent6,The participant," Or not in public, but to friends and it got back to me",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6687,6687,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent7,The participant, So you have to go,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6688,6688,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent8,The participant, And so that was – and she’s a CEO now of a big company,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6689,6689,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent9,The participant, But she just made a stupid mistake,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
6690,6690,1D,1D_57,1D_57_sent10,The participant, But that authority of the chair is really important in managing that diversity,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
6691,6691,1D,1D_58,1D_58_sent0,Margo,"Okay, that’s interesting",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
6692,6692,1D,1D_58,1D_58_sent1,Margo, And you say a natural leader,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6693,6693,1D,1D_58,1D_58_sent2,Margo, Are there any key attributes or characteristic of that natural leader for the chair?,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6694,6694,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent0,The participant,"I’ll start by saying, they way you identify it is the way people defer to them",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6695,6695,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent1,The participant," So for example, when we were sacking the CEO, I was on the side to say no",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6696,6696,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent2,The participant, And the board was pretty much divided,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6697,6697,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent3,The participant, Two people resigned over this issue,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6698,6698,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent4,The participant, From the board,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6699,6699,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent5,The participant, But you could see constantly that they were deferring to her,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6700,6700,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent6,The participant," They were just going okay, what do you think of this? We’re in territory we don’t want to be in",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6701,6701,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent7,The participant, So you do identify by seeing who people defer to,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6702,6702,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent8,The participant, So you do need to be cool under pressure,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
6703,6703,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent9,The participant, You do need to be decisive,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
6704,6704,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent10,The participant, You do need to keep a bigger perspective,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
6705,6705,1D,1D_59,1D_59_sent11,The participant, I know I’ve been mentioning the competency a lot but the competency is a big deal I think,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
6706,6706,1D,1D_6,1D_6_sent0,Margo,Is that better?,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

6709,6709,1D,1D_60,1D_60_sent2,Margo, How does diversity influence your board’s functioning? You’ve talked a little bit about it but do you want to perhaps focus on -,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6710,6710,1D,1D_61,1D_61_sent0,Paul,"And perhaps, The participant, just within the context of the research, if we could focus on diversity in terms of gender, social background, ethnic background, et cetera",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

6714,6714,1D,1D_63,1D_63_sent0,Paul,[inaudible] 00:21:53,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
6715,6715,1D,1D_64,1D_64_sent0,Margo,So how does diversity -,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6716,6716,1D,1D_65,1D_65_sent0,Paul,-@ just to focus a bit on that,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

6721,6721,1D,1D_69,1D_69_sent0,Margo,So like different kinds of diversity might affect functioning differently,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
6722,6722,1D,1D_7,1D_7_sent0,Paul,"Yeah, that’s it",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

6726,6726,1D,1D_70,1D_70_sent2,The participant, So a really good board member will know what questions to ask,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
6727,6727,1D,1D_70,1D_70_sent3,The participant, And the questions will be phrased – so there’ll be two or three management in there,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
6728,6728,1D,1D_70,1D_70_sent4,The participant, And the good board member will be able to ask questions that relate to management,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

9620,9620,25IN,25IN_19,25IN_19_sent0,A,I was just going to say I think the opening up of the Australian economy that occurred in the 1980s and [overtalk] 00:13:57 were part of the [unclear] 00:13:59 helped to redirect the Australian market outwardly and so that brought with it much greater awareness of what was happening in other markets around the world,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

9693,9693,25IN,25IN_37,25IN_37_sent1,A, But this is what I would say is diversity would not be important when you have a leadership of the board viewing diversity and check the box type exercise where they are supportive of diversity in name only,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
9694,9694,25IN,25IN_37,25IN_37_sent2,A, Ultimately they seem to have [unclear] 00:28,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

9696,9696,25IN,25IN_37,25IN_37_sent4,A, And so I guess that’s the only scenario where I can think of at the moment where that diversity is invaluable or not that good is in the scenario where the leadership of the board is not genuinely engaged in brining diversity to the boardroom conversation,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
9697,9697,25IN,25IN_38,25IN_38_sent0,Q,Okay so if the boards not inclusive than diversity’s wasted I guess or irrelevant,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
9698,9698,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent0,A,Exactly,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
9699,9699,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent1,A, If there’s not a genuineness and a posterity to actually value the diversity [unclear] 00:29:30 order and discussion and the composition of the board I guess it’s wasted and it’s a waste of everyone’s collective energies,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
9700,9700,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent2,A, And so it does really start ultimately with recognition of what are the motivations that are at play for the board and particular the leadership of the board because really the chair of the board sets the tone,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
9701,9701,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent3,A," It sets, the person in that role sets the agenda for the board as a whole",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
9702,9702,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent4,A, And if there was not a genuineness about embracing diversity the benefits of it in the right way to facilitate the instillation of diversity within the board then I think you probably potentially got a recipe for disaster there,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
9703,9703,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent5,A, So to me it’s very critical that the leadership of a board bring a genuineness to this and if they are unconvinced by the merits of diversity or they see it as a tick the box exercise then there’s probably a separate conversation that should happen about whether or not the right leadership is in place and if there is a gap in knowledge or a gap in understanding the true value of diversity,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
9704,9704,25IN,25IN_39,25IN_39_sent6,A," There are ways to remedy that and I know that in the past probably ten or fifteen years there has been a need for board shares particularly those that have been professional company directors for a long time perhaps, there has been a comprehensive program of work carried out where it’s been an attention to ensure that new knowledge, new insights are brought to the boardroom table around the benefits [unclear] 00:31:37 value, the virtues of diversity because it’s not a conversation that we had twenty or thirty years ago when perhaps those directors first started becoming professional company directors",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

11020,11020,27D correcte,27D correcte_81,27D correcte_81_sent1,A,  So then we revisited that whole grievance procedure so that it could be made to somebody other than the CEO as well,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

20433,20433,5D,5D_230,5D_230_sent1,A," It's also the smoke and mirrors of how you get on a board, because - again, in some ways, sport boards are easier because they're elected, so we still generally have more elected than appointed, and people will like people like them, so of course you're going to keep getting the same until, as I said, we created the shift where women, like, it's a safe place for me to put my hand up",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
